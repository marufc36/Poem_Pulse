The Biter Bit,"“Ole woman a swea’ fe eat calalu: a swea’ fe wuk him gut”
            —Jamaica Proverb
Corn an’ peas growin’ t’ick an’ fas’
Wid nice blade peepin’ t’rough de grass;
An’ ratta from dem hole a peep,
T’ink all de corn dem gwin’ go reap.
Ole woman sit by kitchen doo’
Is watchin’ calalu a grow,
An’ all de time a t’inking dat
She gwin’ go nyam dem when dem fat.
But calalu, grow’n’ by de hut,
Is swearin’ too fe wuk him gut;
While she, like some, t’ink all is right
When dey are in some corner tight.
Peas time come roun’—de corn is lef’;
An’ ratta now deh train himse’f
Upon de cornstalk dem a’ night
Fe when it fit to get him bite.
De corn-piece lie do’n all in blue,
An’ all de bard dem floatin’ too
Amongst de yellow grain so gay,
Dat you would watch dem a whole day.
An’ ratta look at ebery one,
Swea’in’ dat dem not gwin’ lef’ none;
But Quaco know a t’ing or two,
An’ swear say dat dem won’t go so.
So him go get a little meal
An’ somet’ing good fe those dat steal,
An’ mix dem up an’ ’pread dem out
For people possess fas’ fas’ mout’.
Now ratta, comin’ from dem nes’,
See it an’ say “Dis food is bes’;”
Dem nyam an’ stop, an’ nyam again,
An’ soon lie do’n, rollin’ in pain."
Pleading,"If you lub me, Joanie, only tell me, dear,
            Do not be so cold
            When my lub is bold;
Do not mek dis burnin’ heart o’ mine get drear,
            Tek it for your own,
            For ’tis yours alone.
I hab eber lub’d you from I saw your face
            On dat Monday morn
            ’Mongst de peas an’ corn:
Lightly did you trip along wid yout’ful grace,
            Wid de kerchief red
            Wound about your head.
Durin’ de revival we b’en use’ fe pray,
            Spirit we b’en hab,
            How we use’ fe sob!
Yet how soon did all of it from we get ’way!
            Lub kiver de whole,
            We feget we “soul.”
Though I could’n’ see you when you younger b’en,
            It was better so,
            For we older grow,
An’ I can protect you now from udder men,
            If you’ll only be
            Fe me one, Joanie.
How I saw you proudly draw up to your height—
            As we strolled along
            Gay in laugh an’ song,
Passin’ by de peenies sheddin’ greenish light—
            ’Cos my lips did miss,
            Stealin’ one lee kiss!
’Member you de days down by de river-side,
            I prevented you
            Your washin’ to do,
Teasin’ you at times till you got vex’ an’ cried,
            An’ I try de while
            To coax you fe smile?
Joanie, when you were me own a true sweetheart,
            I lived in de air
            ’Douten t’ought of care,
Thinkin’, O me Joan dat’ nuttin’ could we part,
            Naught to mek me fear
            Fe me own a dear.
When in church on Sunday days we use’ fe sit,
            You dressed in light pink,
            How we used fe wink!
Wha’ de parson say we cared for not a bit,
            Nuttin’ could remove
            Our sweet t’oughts from love.
I am thinkin’, Joanie, when de nights were lone,
            An’ you were afraid
            Of each darkened shade,
An’ I use’ fe guide you over river-stone,
            How you trusted me
            Fe care you, Joanie.
’Member you de time when many days passed by,
            An’ I didn’ come
            To your hill-side home,
How you wrote those sad, sad letters to know why,
            Till I comfort gave
            To my Joanie brave?
In those happy days, me Joan, you loved me then,
            An’ I t’ought dat you
            Would be ever true;
Never dreamed you would forsake me for strange men,
            Who caan’ lub you so
            Much as thrown-up Joe.
Joanie, fickle Joanie, give up Squire’s son;
            You wi’ soon hate him
            An’ his silly whim,
An’ your heart wi’ yearn fe me when I am gone;
            So, ’fo’ ’tis too late,
            Come back to your mate.
Joanie, when you’re tired of dat worthless man,
            You can come back still
            Of your own free will:
Nummo girl dis true, true heart will understan’;
            I wi’ live so-so,
            Broken-hearted Joe.
An’, Joan, in de days fe come I know you’ll grieve
            For de foolishniss
            Dat you now call bliss:
Dere’s no wrong you done me I would not forgive;
            But you choice your way,
            So, me Joan, good-day!"
Beneath the Yampy Shade,"We sit beneat’ de yampy shade, 
  My lee sweetheart an’ I; 
De gully ripples ’cross de glade, 
   Tom Rafflins hurry by. 

Her pa an’ ma about de fiel’
  Are brukin’ sugar-pine; 
An’ plenty, plenty is de yiel’, 
   Dem look so pink an’ fine. 

We listen to a rapturous chune
   Outpourin’ from above; 
De swee-swees, blithesome birds of June, 
   They sing to us of love. 

She plays wid de triangle leaves, 
   Her hand within mine slips; 
She murmurs love, her bosom heaves, 
   I kiss her ripe, ripe lips. 

De cockstones raise deir droopin’ heads
   To view her pretty feet; 
De skellions trimble in deir beds,
   Dey grudge our lub so sweet—

Love sweeter than a bridal dream, 
   A mudder’s fondest kiss; 
Love purer than a crystal stream, 
   De height of eart’ly bliss. 

We hear again de swee-swees’ song
   Outpourin’ on de air; 
Dey sing for yout’, an’ we are young 
   An’ know naught ’bouten care. 

We sit beneat’ de yampy shade, 
  We pledge our hearts anew; 
De swee-swees droop, de bell-flowers fade
   Before our love so true. "
Rise and Fall,"Dey read em again an’ again, 
  An’ laugh an’ cry at ’em in turn; 
I felt I was gettin’ quite vain, 
   But dere was a lesson fe learn. 

My poverty quickly took wing, 
  Of life no experience had I; 
I couldn’ then want anyt’ing
  Dat kindness or money could buy. 

Dey tek me away from me lan’, 
  De gay o’ de wul’ to behold, 
An’ roam me t’rough palaces gran’, 
  An’ show’red on me honour untold. 

I went to de ballroom at night, 
  An’ danced wid de belles of de hour; 
Half dazed by de glitterin’ light, 
   I lounged in de palm-covered bower. 

I flirted wid beautiful girls, 
  An’ drank o’ de wine flowin’ red; 
I felt my brain movin’ in whirls, 
  An’ knew I was losin’ my head. 

But soon I was tired of it all, 
  My spirit was weary to roam; 
De life grew as bitter as gall, 
   I hungered again for my home. 

Te-day I am back in my lan’, 
  Forgotten by all de gay throng, 
A poorer but far wiser man, 
  An’ knowin’ de right from de wrong. "
A Dream,"The roosters give the signal for daybreak, 
  And through my window pours the grey of morn; 
Refreshing breezes fan me as I wake, 
   And down the valley sounds the wesly horn. 

Day broadens, and I ope the window wide, 
   And brilliant sunbeams, mixing, rush between
The gaping blinds, while down at my bedside
   I kneel to utter praise to the Unseen. 

The torch-light glistens through the wattle-pane, 
   And clouds of smoke wreathe upward to the skies; 
My brother at the squeezer juices cane, 
  And visions of tea-hour before me rise. 

Leaving the valley’s cup the fleeting fog
   Steals up the hill-sides decked with sunbeams rare, 
Which send their search-rays ’neath the time-worn log, 
  And drive the sleeping majoes from their lair. 

But there are some that yest’reve was the last 
  For them to sleep into their watery bed; 
For now my treacherous fish-pot has them fast, 
   Their cruel foe which they had so long dread’. 

Right joyfully I hear the school-bell ring, 
   And by my sister’s side away I trot; 
I’m happy as the swee-swees on the wing, 
   And feel naught but contentment in my lot. 

I lightly gambol on the school-yard green, 
  And where the damsels by the bamboo grove
In beautiful and stately growth are seen, 
   For tiny shiny star-apples I rove. 

.     .      .      .      .      .  

The morning wind blows softly past my door, 
   And we prepare for work with gladsome heart; 
Sweetly the wesly horn resounds once more, 
  A warning that ’tis time for us to start. 

I scamper quickly ’cross the fire-burnt soil, 
   And the coarse grass-tufts prick my tender feet; 
I watch my father at his honest toil, 
   And wonder how he stands the sun’s fierce heat. 

A winding footpath down the woodland leads, 
  And through the tall fox-tails I wend my way 
Down to the brooklet where the pea-dove feeds, 
   And bucktoes in the water are at play. 

And watching as the bubbles rise and fall, 
   I hear above the murmur of the dale
The tropic music dear to great and small, 
   The joyous outburst of the nightingale. 

.     .       .        .      .       .

Gone now those happy days when all was blest, 
   For I have left my home and kindred dear; 
In a strange place I am a stranger’s guest, 
   The pains, the real in life, I’ve now to bear. 

No more again I’ll idle at my will, 
  Running the mongoose down upon the lea;
No more I’ll jostle Monty up the hill, 
   To pick the cashews off the laden tree. 

I feel the sweetness of those days again, 
   And hate, so hate, on the past scenes to look; 
All night in dreaming comes the awful pain, 
   All day I groan beneath the iron yoke. 

In mercy then, ye Gods, deal me swift death! 
   Ah! you refuse, and life instead you give; 
You keep my here and still prolong my breath, 
   That I may suffer all the days I live. 

.      .      .     .     .      .     .

’Tis home again, but not the home of yore; 
   Sadly the scenes of bygone days I view, 
And as I walk the olden paths once more, 
   My heart grows chilly as the morning dew. 

But see! to-day again my life is glad, 
   My heart no more is lone, nor will it pine; 
A comfort comes, an earthly fairy clad
   In white, who guides me with her hand in mine. 

Her lustrous eyes gleam only tender love, 
   And viewing her, an angel form I see; 
I feed my spirit on my gentle dove, 
   My sweetheart Lee, my darling Idalee. 

And where the peenies glow with grenish fire, 
   We kiss and kiss and pledge our hearts as true; 
Of sweet love-words and hugs we never tire, 
   But felt more sorry that they were so few. 

.    .      .        .         .       .

I leave my home again, wand’ring afar, 
   But goes with me her true, her gentle heart, 
Every to be my hope, my guiding star, 
   And whisperings of comfort to impart. 

Methinks we’re strolling by the woodland stream, 
  And my fame thrills with joy to her her sing:
But, O my God! ’tis all—’tis all a dream; 
    This is the end, the rude awakening. 
 "
Walls,"translated from the modern Greek by John Cavafy
Without reflection, without mercy, without shame,
they built strong walls and high, and compassed me about.
And here I sit now and consider and despair.
It wears away my heart and brain, this evil fate:
I had outside so many things to terminate.
Oh! why when they were building could I not beware!
But never a sound of building, never an echo came.
Insensibly they drew the world and shut me out. 
  Τείχη
  Χωρίς περίσκεψιν, χωρίς λύπην, χωρίς αιδώ
μεγάλα κ’ υψηλά τριγύρω μου έκτισαν τείχη.
Και κάθομαι και απελπίζομαι τώρα εδώ.
Άλλο δεν σκέπτομαι: τον νουν μου τρώγει αυτή η τύχη·
διότι πράγματα πολλά έξω να κάμω είχον.
A όταν έκτιζαν τα τείχη πώς να μην προσέξω.
Aλλά δεν άκουσα ποτέ κρότον κτιστών ή ήχον.
Aνεπαισθήτως μ’ έκλεισαν από τον κόσμον έξω."
Heartless Rhoda,"Kiss me, as you want it so; 
   Lub me, ef it wort’ de while; 
Yet I feel it an’ I know
Dat, as t’rough de wul’ you go, 
   You will oft look back an’ smile
At de t’ings which you now do. 

Tek me to de church te-day, 
   Call me wife as you go home; 
Hard fate, smilin’ at us, say 
Dat de whole is so-so play; 
   Soon de ushal en’ will come, 
An’ we both will choice our way. 

.      .     .     .     .     .      . 

Spare you’ breat’, me husban’ true, 
   I be’n marry you fe fun: 
Lub dat las’ long is a few, 
An’ I hadn’t much fe you. 
   I be’n tell you it would done, 
All whe’ come is wha’ you do. 

Life I only care to see
   In de way dat udders live; 
I experiment to be
All dat fate can mek o’ me: 
   Glad I tek all whe’ she give, 
For I’m hopin’ to be free. "

Mahogany,"No relations but in things—
My father and the economists in repetition
The mahogany tree and its crown
Large shining leaves
Rustling between the rivers
My daughter emerges on the year
Independence is counted
Her power now also commodity
Crown takes crown
Settlement becomes colony
Then crown colony then country
This, the manifestation of matter and idea
Content itself giving birth
To the form already latent
Treaties, trees, children
Appearances, like change

The land, the people
Clearing the land for the extraction of wealth
A chair comes into being
Devoid of social history
We see only a chair

Compensation,"Dere is a rest-place for de weary feet,

Killin’ Nanny,"Two little pickny is watchin’ ,
    While a goat is led to deat’ ;
Dey are little ones of two years,

De udder wid joy is starin’,

When dey had forgotten Nanny,

An’ de forehead of de laughter

Kite-Flying,"Higher fly, my pretty kite,

As up an’ up an’ up you mount

     of the times I’ve striven
Just to soar away like you,

Wider dash your streamin’ tail

Messengers I send along,
     lee round papers of bright red;
up they go to swell you’ song,
    climbin’ on the slimber t’ read.
Higher fly, my pretty kite,
    higher, ever higher;
draw me with you to your height
    out the earthly mire.

Drought Essay,"The Orlando dead;  the  ribbons  and signs on the rotary’s fence.  My mind fringed 
like  that,  bitten  by  heat,  sky-kicking.  At  work the  soil  was  thin  and  the  land
was  lent;  long  rows for  kids to  play  at  tending.  There  to help,  I  once  allowed
the lettuce plants to fry to lace in minutes, like a joke. I cut my braids into the sink
and     thought     about     you    on     the     bus.    Tomatoes     bubbled    overnight,
stovetop    unattended.  What   profusion   I   found   I   made   a   little   dangerous.
The  corn I’d  spaced  or planted  badly  called out touch me,  lonely  perfect tassels
to   the   wind.   When   we    shucked   the   first   ripe   one,   only   half   filled   out,
even  the  cruel   twins   left   the  shed  and   pressed   to  look  and   touch  the  ear.
Its freak pearls, its cool thread. "
Instructions Before Stuttering,"Tread where the name has prepared
A full name full of desire
Clay like plenty
Love is sensitive
In the space of crying
The name goes ahead

Walk slow

Sappho for Everybody,"A fundamental part of being queer is being erased, I explain at
            the outset of my talk this basic premise requiring 5.7 
            seconds to sink into the minds of my delegation 
At the nightmare board meeting that has derailed my dreams, I’m
            dashing in cobalt suit, white pocket square, a humble 
            multi-tasker before a great glass boardroom, clicker in hand,
            shoulder pads to the wind, I let it rip, my modest proposal: 
                                     STRAIGHT GAY CULTURE
            Savior stories of access and entitlement everyone can love  
It’s already here! I warble, juggling my wagers in perfect sync,
            Big nonsense proclamations followed by primal screams
            always get them to their feet,  
I have in my possession the latest in a genre I call gauche rive
            gauche: a new straight fantasy novel about dead white 
            lesbians written under lockdown while sunbathing in the south of
            France, 
My board members get it—guaranteed mainstream reviews!—but
            they’re genuinely charmed by the true star of the author
            photo, the poetess’s tiny background husband in swim trunks
            near the sea,  
Letters of support stream in from the usual best-sellers, To whom it may
            concern: Our transphobic books feature exciting transgender
            protagonists, more huzzahs from the board,  
Ever tearful, never fearful, I grab my trophy and confess, I myself was
            obliged to attend the transgender studies panel organized by
            cis studies, so I ask, Does tour always mean tourism? 
Rhetorical flourish before I walk them through the numbers, A
            figure in Kevlar rolls in the coffee cart, which is how I know
            I’m screwed, 
                                     Everyone gets shoved in a van at some point
                                     and

                                                            gets

            As the world turns                  gays lie awake 
                      gagging on fake episodes                   the only time we cry 
Nervously I apply                     a stick and tint 
            because I’m fabulous and I’m about to meet my maker! 
Between argonauts and incels            I leopard crawl her whereabouts
            Windex squeaks on a secret 
                                                swaddled in her No Razzismo tote bag 
Unmistakable alarm, is it not?             So I twist 
                      as in meme                                          and freeze 
“You are ideal and failure, sentiment and lure,” says my maker,
            a distant relative of Pierre Louÿs, whose ghost stands just
            beyond her on the shore, gripping his sun bleached conch over his
            head, scrawled upon it:                       bed death is a lie 
200 years later the bottle floats back, rolls of film inside sloshed in
            gin, bitter outtakes from tar, from rent, from what I realize is
            theirs and always has been 
  This is after after after 
            The fundament of our relations is soft 
They creep over us like mist 
            But in the future          when distance fails
                       gays awake softer still"
Sappho,"The twilight’s inner flame grows blue and deep,
And in my Lesbos, over leagues of sea,
The temples glimmer moonwise in the trees.
Twilight has veiled the little flower face
Here on my heart, but still the night is kind
And leaves her warm sweet weight against my breast.
Am I that Sappho who would run at dusk
Along the surges creeping up the shore
When tides came in to ease the hungry beach,
And running, running, till the night was black,
Would fall forespent upon the chilly sand
And quiver with the winds from off the sea?
Ah, quietly the shingle waits the tides
Whose waves are stinging kisses, but to me
Love brought no peace, nor darkness any rest.
I crept and touched the foam with fevered hands
And cried to Love, from whom the sea is sweet,
From whom the sea is bitterer than death.
Ah, Aphrodite, if I sing no more
To thee, God’s daughter, powerful as God,
It is that thou hast made my life too sweet
To hold the added sweetness of a song.
There is a quiet at the heart of love,
And I have pierced the pain and come to peace.
I hold my peace, my Cleïs, on my heart;
And softer than a little wild bird’s wing
Are kisses that she pours upon my mouth.
Ah, never any more when spring like fire
Will flicker in the newly opened leaves,
Shall I steal forth to seek for solitude
Beyond the lure of light Alcæus’ lyre,
Beyond the sob that stilled Erinna’s voice.
Ah, never with a throat that aches with song,
Beneath the white uncaring sky of spring,
Shall I go forth to hide awhile from Love
The quiver and the crying of my heart.
Still I remember how I strove to flee
The love-note of the birds, and bowed my head
To hurry faster, but upon the ground
I saw two wingèd shadows side by side,
And all the world’s spring passion stifled me.
Ah, Love, there is no fleeing from thy might,
No lonely place where thou hast never trod,
No desert thou hast left uncarpeted
With flowers that spring beneath thy perfect feet.
In many guises didst thou come to me;
I saw thee by the maidens while they danced,
Phaon allured me with a look of thine,
In Anactoria I knew thy grace,
I looked at Cercolas and saw thine eyes;
But never wholly, soul and body mine,
Didst thou bid any love me as I loved.
Now I have found the peace that fled from me;
Close, close, against my heart I hold my world.
Ah, Love that made my life a lyric cry,
Ah, Love that tuned my lips to lyres of thine,
I taught the world thy music, now alone
I sing for one who falls asleep to hear."
Recitative,"Regard the capture here, O Janus-faced,
As double as the hands that twist this glass.
Such eyes at search or rest you cannot see;
Reciting pain or glee, how can you bear!
Twin shadowed halves: the breaking second holds
In each the skin alone, and so it is
I crust a plate of vibrant mercury
Borne cleft to you, and brother in the half.
Inquire this much-exacting fragment smile,
Its drums and darkest blowing leaves ignore,—
Defer though, revocation of the tears
That yield attendance to one crucial sign.
Look steadily—how the wind feasts and spins
The brain’s disk shivered against lust. Then watch
While darkness, like an ape’s face, falls away,
And gradually white buildings answer day.
Let the same nameless gulf beleaguer us—
Alike suspend us from atrocious sums
Built floor by floor on shafts of steel that grant
The plummet heart, like Absalom, no stream.
The highest tower,—let her ribs palisade
Wrenched gold of Nineveh;—yet leave the tower.
The bridge swings over salvage, beyond wharves;
A wind abides the ensign of your will . . .
In alternating bells have you not heard
All hours clapped dense into a single stride?
Forgive me for an echo of these things,
And let us walk through time with equal pride."
Twin I,"                                     I.
I had thought we’d said everything we needed to say
when you were in the hospital
and the nurses were running around
trying to figure
out how to make you more comfortable.
Would you like some more water?
But I continued to have entire conversations
with you in my head. Now, no one speaks.
You died of a virus no one knew the name of.
And when scientists found a name,
our parents declared that people like you
deserved to die.
No one would touch you.
No one from family went to your funeral.
Your body was burned.
                                     II.
Trees lose leaves in winter. Every year birds return
to lusher resorts. No one thing ever leaves,
I tell myself, falls away completely.
When does it become unreasonable to cry?
I lay lilacs next to your headstone,
all of our family now gone, trace the letters
in your name, round out vowels
with my fingertips, shallowed out
beyond recognition to anyone but me.
 "
Self-Care Is a Psy-Op,"—a meme 
I am taking my iPhone to see my therapist. 
& I’m all like See see see see listen look there was a goose 
born without webbed feet I saw on Instagram & Farmer Gene
fitted Andy (that’s the goose’s name!!) with baby-sized Nikes
so Andy could walk but someone killed him anyway. The goose!
Clipped at his throat; wings severed & missing. In 1991.  
Never caught who did it. I’ve been drunk about it all day.
& my therapist wants to learn more about me & I tell her
what the FBI already downloaded: In 1991, I was born 
under a cloud of red, stolen feathers. 
I’ve been meaning to tell you that I’m taking myself 
seriously for once. I’ve learned so much since I paid 
my internet bill. I quit hissing. Jasmine tea miraculously 
appears in my mug where there once was rum. & now, I can
laugh, entertaining Eric with my strong strategy for the future
dystopia, in which I escape to the Minnesota lakes to harvest
milk from the last of the nation’s orphaned goats. 
You & my therapist say I spend too much time online, stupefied,
with the curtains drawn & my hand down the front, clicking myself.
But you don’t understand. The metaphor being I am the goose &
I’m contemporary to some degree. God knows who in this country is
Farmer Andy. But my sense of humor is the webbed feet & the Nikes
are my Blackness & my mellow but I’m killed anyway. You say turn It off,
but It’s where everyone contemporary is having contemporary arguments
no one started. Individuality is a phenomenon for which none of our social
structures adequately prepared us. I am always a better version away from
myself. & I can realize nothing else. "
Oranges & Sardines,"Last night we stayed home.
Last night we stayed home again.
Last night you drank scotch, watched TV.
And we stayed home again.
Last night I looked at you in the half light.
Your head up, you held your scotch.
We stayed home again, watched TV
I watched you lift your glass.
I saw your mother in your eyes.
We talked when the movie stopped.
We stayed home again last night.
I was looking for something.
I was looking for something to say.
About the woman in the movie we were watching.
And the man she looked at without words.
Sometimes, I look at you without looking for something.
They were watching TV, this man, this woman.
They held hands, I held yours.
It was your mother’s hand so it was mine.
It was your father’s hand so it was mine.
Last night we stayed home.
Last night we stayed home again.
Last night you drank scotch, we watched TV.
I sipped from a glass of red wine.
The scotch was brilliant,
the color of oranges & sardines,
flickering in the flickering light.
We stayed home again, last night, last night, last night.
Tomorrow again, the grey, grey light,
will hang like a bracelet, a loom, a loom.
That grey light I sometimes see you in.
But it doesn’t matter now in our bed, in this room, this room.
Last night we stayed home, again.
Last night you drank scotch, we watched TV.
I drank from your glass, orange & sardines.
The scotch spun, I held your hand.
I am looking for something to say,
About the woman in the movie we were watching.
And the man she looked at without words.
I remember what that couple remembered about themselves.
The scotch spun oranges, the TV sardines.
Lights off, socks on, I kissed you,
our bodies, shape shifting pails of sand,
silence rubbing away our names and our voices,
We stayed at home again, last night, two owls.
Your hair is the color of fine scotch, mine, sardines.
How wise we’ve become perched aloft in our feathered bed.
Last night we remember, everything about ourselves, said."

stars
whole patterns of them
rocking around in the radiant arena
above and around our heads
on a night when the wind
sang like a scream
and the deer stood frozen
as a statue of itself
the sky was dark because
la luna had finished revealing themself
and was not yet ready to 
begin again
and I get it now:
a stanza is like a little frame
and the frame is a little crooked 
jenny
calls from the road and we talk
I walk 
so briefly we together
move from our faraway states
synced perhaps by the clap
of hooves and burning oil
and the telephone can be a line
like any other wire
so can I say it:
love frightens me
the matter it contains
the speed the direction
even words of thanks
at the reference desk
from a patron
gracias, amor
haunt me in the quiet places . . .
but if “god is change” 
then is it god who sent my matter
hurtling back into the open open
can anybody tell me how to contain it
clockwork
even the moon
on a calendar stacked
fluxes away and comes back
striking disclosure
arrives in flashes"
Time-Sensitive,"“When did the ‘present’ begin?”
            —Lauren Berlant
When the tyrant’s voice comes on the car radio, I close my eyes in an effort to slow the rate at which hopelessness enters me. With this act, I hurl myself faster toward extinction.
Every morning, I stretch, put food in my throat, and fail to forgive myself. 
At night, I sit down to watch last year’s extinctions paint the wall, while next time’s fire buffers in a perpetual next time.
Somewhere between these, I occupy the present tense, with all the confidence of a settler.
Sometime before was when the things we survived happened. What am I surviving today: the war or its unending ending?
I remember none of it and so live without language for its opposite. 
The country (was/is) divided, the US military (occupied/has occupied) the country, I (return/am returning) there. 
What is the opposite of the present tense? 
(I’m speaking, I say, until it’s no longer true.)
I love next time. I love it with all the declarative confidence of a child who’s never fished the softened bodies of her parents from a river as soldiers chew cud.
History hangs inside me, like a dependent clause.
History ends when its mirrors rush from the future like brake lights, polishing me into language.
After the catastrophe. By polishing me; through buffering grammar. In red memories dotting the highway smudged out by a storm. By the tyrant, unevenly distributed. With current.
The screech of tires is just the sound of my past catching up with yours."

"Substance, Shadow, and Spirit","translated from the Chinese by Arthur Waley
High and low, wise and simple, all busily hoard up the moments of life. How greatly they err!
Therefore I have to the uttermost exposed the bitterness both of Substance and Shadow, and have made Spirit show how, by following Nature, we may dissolve this bitterness.
                           Substance speaks to Shadow:
Heaven and Earth exist for ever:
Mountains and rivers never change.
But herbs and trees in perpetual rotation
Are renovated and withered by the dews and frosts:
And Man the wise, Man the divine—
Shall he alone escape this law?
Fortuitously appearing for a moment in the World
He suddenly departs, never to return.
How can he know that the friends he has left
Are missing him and thinking of him?
Only the things that he used remain;
They look upon them and their tears flow.
Me no magical arts can save,
Though you may hope for a wizard’s aid.
I beg you listen to this advice—
When you can get wine, be sure to drink it.
                           Shadow replies:
There is no way to preserve life.
Drugs of Immortality are instruments of folly.
I would gladly wander in Paradise,
But it is far away and there is no road.
Since the day that I was joined to you
We have shared all our joys and pains.
While you rested in the shade, I left you a while:
But till the end we shall be together.
Our joint existence is impermanent:
Sadly together we shall slip away.
That when the body decays Fame should also go
Is a thought unendurable, burning the heart.
Let us strive and labour while yet we may
To do some deed that men will praise.
Wine may in truth dispel our sorrow,
But how compare it with lasting Fame?
                           Spirit expounds:
God can only set in motion:
He cannot control the things he has made.
Man, the second of the Three Orders,
Owes his precedence to Me.
Though I am different from you,
We were born involved in one another:
Nor by any means can we escape
The intimate sharing of good and ill.
The Three Emperors were saintly men,
Yet to-day—where are they?
P’ēng lived to a great age,
Yet he went at last, when he longed to stay.
And late or soon, all go:
Wise and simple have no reprieve.
Wine may bring forgetfulness.
But does it not hasten old-age?
If you set your hearts on noble deeds,
How do you know that any will praise you?
By all this thinking you do Me injury:
You had better go where Fate leads—
Drift on the Stream of Infinite Flux,
Without joy, without fear:
When you must go—then go,
And make as little fuss as you can.

Pavilion of Nothingness,"I join the screw
posing questions in the wall,
a lackluster sound
color covered with a blanket.
But I falter and momentarily
blind, I can barely feel myself.
All at once, I call to mind,
with my fingernails I tunnel
a tokonoma in the wall.
I need a tiny hollow,
it’s there I go diminishing
to reappear anew,
to touch myself and set my forehead in its place.
A tiny hollow in the wall.
Multiplier of weariness 
the café I’m sitting in,
the insistent daiquiri
returning like a face of no use
for death, for springtime.
With my hands I trace the length
of a lapel that feels cold to me.
I wait for no one and I insist
on someone’s pressing arrival.
All at once, with my fingernail
I draw a tiny crevice on the table.
There it is, the tokonoma, the hollow,
I’m in company unrivaled,
a corner conversation in Alexandria.
We’re together in a round
of skaters through the Prado.
He was a child who inhaled
all the tenacious dew from the sky,
even then with the hollow, like a cat
that circles the whole body
with a silence full of flickerings.
Within reach of what surrounds us,
and close to our body,
the stubborn notion that says our soul
and its enwraptment fit
inside a tiny hollow in the wall
or on a tissue paper scratched with a fingernail.
I’m diminishing
I’m a point that disappears and returns
and a fit full-length inside the tokonoma.
I make myself invisible
and on the verso I recover my body
swimming at the beach,
encircled by bachelors of art with banners of snow,
mathematicians and baseball players
describing sapodilla ice cream.
The hollow is smaller than a deck of cards
and it can be as big as the sky,
but we can shape it with our fingernail
along the brim of a coffee cup
or in the sky that falls beside our shoulder.
The beginning is united with the tokonoma,
in the hollow a kangaroo can hide
without forfeit of its bounding joy.
The apparition of a cave is
mysterious and begins to disentangle its dreadful.
To hide there is to tremble,
the hunter’s horns resound
in the frozen forest.
But the hollow is soothing,
we can lure it with a thread
and usher it in to insignificance.
I scrape the wall with a fingernail,
slivers of lime crumble down
as though they were shards
from the celestial tortoise shell.
Is the barrenness in the hollow
the first and final path?
I fall asleep, in the tokonoma
the other still walking is the one I evaporate."
Anthony and Cleopatra,"The galleys, arms
crossed over the serpent
and the turquoise eye stained
with saffron dust.
The silky waters
contemplate with silver eyes
the embroidery furrowed along the sails
of the Roman trireme,
with a voluptuousness sweetly
scratching the holes of the flute.
Light splinters when touched
by the prow and the seagull
trembles receiving the unexpected
thrust, that like a finger tickles
the solar breast feathers
interchanging the colors of a bonfire.
The tiara slips at the level of the water
and there it mesmerizes the subdivided smile of sardines.
(Each sardine a nibble at the tiara)
(Each tiara on the volcanoes of the moon
makes a monkey in purple taffeta dance)
Tunics are billowed by the wind
when the bosom accordion keeps time.
The serpent slithers in search of a date, not a nipple,
the ringed index finger guided the bite.
The sorcerer showed the back of his leg,
he wanted to take part in the banquet
and not to read the clouds dissolving their letters.
The messenger startled by eunuchs
murmurs beside the silk galley.
At stern he is covered by an awning 
of algae, Horus’s nakedness
resembles death.
The ores splinter over the heads of crocodiles,
make way for the leaps
of the purple-clad monkey.
The galley halts, a crash of cymbals
in the onslaught of each wave.
The serpent leaps on the musicians’ awning.
We say silk galleys
and we shut our eyes.
A millenary reminiscence
moves the serpent again, there
the nipple is reconstructed.
Regard the wood-louse walking the lettuce. 
 "
The Wild Swans,"translated from the French of Judith Gautier by James Whitall
Before daybreak the breezes whisper 
through the trellis at my window;
they interrupt and carry off my dream, 
and he of whom I dreamed 
vanishes from me. 
I climb upstairs 
to look from the topmost window, 
but with whom? . . .
I remember how I used to stir the fire 
with my hairpin of jade 
as I am doing now . . .
but the brasier holds nothing but ashes. 
I turn to look at the mountain; 
there is a thick mist, 
a dismal rain, 
and I gaze down at the wind-dappled river, 
the river that flows past me forever 
without bearing away my sorrow. 
I have kept the rain of my tears 
on the crape of my tunic; 
with a gesture I fling these bitter drops 
to the wild swans on the river, 
that they may be my messengers.
    Les Cygnes Sauvages
translated from the Chinese of Li Qingzhao by Judith Gautier
Le vent souffle, avant l’aube, au dehors, sur les treillis de ma fenêtre.
Il interrompt et emporte mon rêve, il efface tout vestige de lui.
Pour voir aux alentours, je monte à l’étage supérieur . . . avec qui? . . .
Autrefois, je me souviens, du bout de l’épingle en jade de ma coiffure, je remuais le feu,
Comme je le fais à présent . . . mais le brasero est éteint.
  Je tourne la tête vers la montagne: la pluie, un épais brouillard.
Je regarde vers le fleuve, tout bossué de vagues; le fleuve qui coule toujours, devant moi, sans emporter ma peine.
Sur le crêpe de ma tunique, j’ai gardé la pluie de mes larmes;
D’une chiquenaude, je chasse ces gouttes amères vers les cygnes du fleuve, pour qu’ils soient mes messagers.
    浪淘沙·帘外五更风
帘外五更风，
吹梦无踪。
画楼重上与谁同？
记得玉钗斜拨火，
宝篆成空。
回首紫金峰，
雨润烟浓。
一江春浪醉醒中。
留得罗襟前日泪，
弹与征鸿。"
Vita Nuova,"in the book of the life I have made, my memory would
appear cursed, and halfway, by affairs
and irrational fears: Capitalism in inescapable. We were popular
with men knew.
Light sticks my white tennis shorts,
and life feels life in a city for each still visible and waiting.
This is the 21st century.
We never leave the life is elsewhere. The clemency of men disapears
as does the light, tarring the roofs."
Writing Prompt,"Imagine you’re an astronaut stuck in outer space. And it’s just you. Only you. What would you write about? What
do you see outside your spaceship windshield? What do you miss? Who is your brother now, all those miles down? Where’s west? What would you have brought, had you known you would be out here, maybe forever, all by yourself?
What about regret? What if 
there are whole days where you don’t think of your hands? How closely related 
is loneliness to remembrance?—when you let yourself think about it?
Do the stars feel heavier now? 
Is there, truly, anything you would do over?—knowing everything you know now? If regret was a type of animal, any animal, what song would it sing in you?
Outside are all these tiny windows you can’t look through. 
Do you miss having a sky to throw wishes against? What did it look like last?—describe the blue. 
What phrases do you miss people saying? By “people” I mean: 
write about something small—but with great detail—about everyone you love. 
What blurs then builds a forest inside you? Is that too specific? Pretend 
it’s summer again and that you’re the fire for it—would it even be worth writing about? 
Would you, by now, meaning in outer space, and very much alone, want to replay the moments of your life you wished had gone differently?—Or have you gotten over it all already? What stage are we in? Is being stuck in space like dying and not getting to ghost-visit your own funeral? Which is the first moment you’d go back to in order to change it? By it I mean where the regret sprang from. Would you feel bad about the rippling? Is worry just a wider room? There is always a box in which regret will fit. After you tape it shut, describe the sound. Describe the blue."
Nearly all my friends call me spoiled and ungrateful.,"But what do they know of endlessness? In Los Angeles
it is as though someone has copy-pasted the same 
morning over and over and over and over and over
three-hundred-and-sixty-five fucking mornings 
in a row. I wake to the same sun and stucco and slate
blue sky. If sunlight is the best disinfectant
why do seasonal birds migrated for winter choose 
my patch of sidewalk to die on? There’s no dignity
in the corpse left lying to collect sand and Snickers
wrappers in its feathers. Where I’m from, storm 
clouds and cold span entire seasons. Our sun is
an incandescent bulb that does nothing to keep us 
warm. We smother its glow when we want to
feel our shadows, elastic. Here, I get tired 
just looking at the agave outside my window. 
How it holds its shape. How it’s never allowed
to wilt. Some days I draw the bathroom blinds
and stand beneath my shower, pretending rain,
but even I can’t resist wandering outside, again,
passing, again, the turnstiles of my life, its sharp
and spiteful gardens, my face craned up for a light
that promises and promises and promises."
Blood Sex,"And when we are finished, I ask
            if she thinks us grotesque,
two plain monsters basking
            in our blood—our liquid plaque.
We celebrate the art of
            our unmaking. She spirals my body
into a single drop, ambrosia
            spoiled by the Gods. I copy
the signature of her sin-
            ged moan, grind it down
until it becomes my own dim
            map. Even the Gods fuck. Crown
themselves in gardens pastored
            by snakes. I am crying. Not out of shame
but out of tradition. To have mastered
            this want, only to carve for it a lock, a name
as queer as unholy. How queer it fits
            inside the mouth, how queer is my woman
and the sweat she makes of me, a sweet trick
            of her tongue. Don’t we deserve a hand-
made altar. Don’t we deserve a crowd
            of worshipers to carry our bed. And yes
please to the beads, the sacred
            wars, the body ornaments, the vain-eyed
statues pulsing deep with our flood.
            Yes to the orchestrated violence, a quiver
licked down my spine. May our love blood
            the skies like a storm of Gods high off terror.
O Zeus. O Oshun. O Ra. O Kali. O Me. O Her. O Gods—God? 
            Yes. Gods. Don’t act like you don’t know our names’ roar.
Whispered. Sweet and savage inside your temples.
            Preserved behind velvet doors."
Mother,"I saw the face of my mother again.
It was a night that seemed to have severed
night from sleep.
The night drew on or halted,
a cutting knife or a hurricane gust,
but the dream didn’t head for its night.
I felt as if everything weighed upward,
you spoke there, almost murmuring,
in the ear of some tiny crab,
alright, I know this because I saw her smile
that wanted to approach to offer me
the little creature,
to watch its amusing crawl
or to plunge it in hot flour.
The ripe corncob like a baby tooth,
in a drawer teeming with silver-plated ants.
The simile of the drawer like a snake,
the size of an arm, a snake rendering slivers
out of the folded length of its tongue, the one
where old watches are kept, the hilarious
frightful talking drawer.
Groping along the door frame,
to begin to feel, covering my eyes,
though eventually motionless,
that what remained was heavier,
with the lightness of what the rain weighs
or the harp’s venetian blinds.
The courtyard was attended
by the entire moon, along with the other invited meteors.
The itinerary of their habit was auspicious and magical.
I watched the door,
but the rest of her body remained subtracted,
like someone who begins to speak,
who laughs again
but who, lingering between the door
and whatever else remains,
seems to have left and then returns.
What’s left is God maybe,
minus myself maybe,
maybe the solar scraping
within which, astride, maybe the self.
At my side, the other body
breathing with eyes
adhered to the rock of this spherical emptiness.
It all began to vanish
into a whirling metal with borders
assaulted by the brevity of flames,
into the steam rising from a tiny
cup of morning coffee,
into locks of hair."
The Commodities Market,"Where one finds poetry, one finds the Lord,
God of Epic, a golden instrument on Our Lord’s plums, God the body,
pelt of Our Lord, red cap for red God, tree of the Heavens.
Remember, José Daniel? The God we engraved on our desks?
Christ of Our Lord, Christ of Our Children.
Lord’s denominator in the Lord’s arithmetic, a pair of children scissors.
God at our borders, the salt of Our Lord, God’s ocean of cotton, of sugar.
A nickname for God: The Lord Elephant. Lord mule.
Lord’s acres. Hospital Lord. Texas for God Alabama.
God’s sea of blue tarps.
Our Lord’s November. An August for Our God. Roses of God
for the roses.
Freights for God’s rest, clouds for the Lord. Will the Gods
disappear, their arms full of roses?
God in the shadows, 11 months of God in the shadows,
the dogs relieving themselves
on the walls of the Lord, the wall of our Lord, Our Lord in God’s roses,
Lord’s wound flowering red.
One heaven of fog clouding faces for heaven of roses—a heaven
for God, Our Lord and the Darkness
of numbers, Lord’s icebox, Lord’s cages
for the Children of God, an armful of roses
for roses of God, God’s labor, God’s Wednesdays
as labor and the labor of God.
    El mercado de materia prima
  Donde se encuentre la poesía, se encuentra su Dios
epopeya, el tenedor oro en ciruelas de Dios, el Dios en su cuerpo,
sus pieles de Dios, su gorro de Dios rojo, el árbol de los cielos.
¿Recuerdas, José Daniel, cuando grabamos al Dios en los pupitres?
El Cristo de Dios, el Cristo de los Niños.
Su aritmética el denominador de Dios, las tijeras
de los Niños.
El Dios en las fronteras, la sal
de su Dios, su mar de algodón, de azúcar.
El Dios en su apodo de Dios Elefante. Dios mula.
Los terrenos de Dios.  El Dios de hospitales. Un Texas para el Dios 
Alabama.
Su mar de carpas azules.
El Dios su noviembre. Su agosto de Dios. Las rosas de Dios
de sus rosas.
El Dios su vagón donde duerme su Dios en sus nubes. ¿Desaparecerán
los Dioses con rosas en sus brazos?
El Dios en su sombrío, 11 meses de sombrío de Dios,
los perros orinando
sobre los muros de Dios, el muro de Dios, el Dios en sus rosas,
Dios su llaga de flamboyán.
El cielo estaba encancaranublado, encancaranublado de rosas
su Dios, Dios en sus turbios
números, la hielera de Dios, las jaulas de Dios
de sus niños, sus rosas de manos
de rosas de Dios, su trabajo, su miércoles
de Dios, su trabajo de Dios."
HomeGoods,"Immediately after the diagnosis, we flip through the racks.
Each of us yearns for a sweater or spoons—a reason to stay—a bargain—a bet.
Ma and I search different sections of the store for something—then each other.
Her—in lamps. Me—in clothes. Striking wires—
The clacking hangers clapping one after another—bursting at the joints 
mimicking the sounds of knobs turning,
or window panes breaking in slow motion, the air knocked out of them, too.
I stack clearance candles in our cart.
Ma checks out bathroom rugs and kitchen towels.
These days we build separate homes from red tag items.
I miss Ma the most between the Kitchen and Women’s Clothing departments.
Unraveled by the operation of how 
one builds a house from the inside.
A second diagnosis that day: I won’t ever come back here alone after she’s gone.
Isn’t shopping a series of searching?
On the best days, everything is a grab—a steal—cancer and—my mother from me.
My hope is that every space with four walls—that every day of treatment 
will be a door out—will be sunlight in bags—despite discount—let it be—big—
all the time we buy back. "
In Defense of the Life Assignment,"I started at the surface, feeling about my face,
the low jawbone my mother had given me
as weapon against austerity. Two decades before,
my father had died. I was desperate under summer’s
isosceles. A fragile machine descended
with a yellowing haze on the city.
Whom had I been then, but the sediment inside
that thing I named Ricardo Alberto?
Blessed is he, blessed in the reddening
of medical pins, blessed under fluorine yolks.
I venerated my mother at Centro Médico, her prayer cards
at midnight, the saffron of her blood tearing as it coursed,
a thick mass on concrete inside coral.
Mother, today it snows in another city besieged by comet tails.
You breathed that day, the sharp instrument of men
on your heart—waded, they waded, I remember the wings
of your lungs. It was midnight when I went in search of angels
in the shoes of the sick near the gates of heaven.
On the seventh day, we all take repose in the Kingdom
of the Sick. Blessed are they, blessed the cold comfort of a wind
rushing over teeth, blessed the long corridors
of heaven, blessed the gelatin in refrigerators,
the instant coffee, blessed our sentence of silver, of flowers.
Blessed may they be, blessed.
    En defensa de la vida asignada
  Empecé al ras, tanteando en mi rostro
el mentón bajo que me había entregado mi madre
como rango contra la austeridad. Dos décadas atrás,
había muerto mi padre. Yo lloraba bajo el isósceles
de junio. Una maquina frágil como niebla amarilla
de estrellas había descendido sobre la ciudad.
¿Quién habré sido aquella vez, además del sedimento dentro
de algo que había llamado Ricardo Alberto?
Bienaventurado sea, bienaventurado en el rojo
fijo y aséptico de alfileres, bienaventurado bajo las yemas de flúor.
Veneré a mi madre en Centro Médico, sus estampitas a media
noche, el azafrán de sangre que rasgaba su curso de masa espesa
sobre el concreto de coral.
Madre, hoy nieva en otra ciudad bajo colas de cometas.
Apenas respirabas aquel día con los instrumentos ásperos
de hombres en tu corazón. Bogando, bogando, recuerdo las alas
de tu pulmón. Eran las doce cuando salí en búsqueda de ángeles
entre los zapatos de los enfermos cerca de las puertas del cielo.
Era el séptimo día cuando se tomaba la siesta en el Reino
de los Enfermos. Bienaventurados sean, bienaventurado el rumor
frío acogedor sobre los dientes, bienaventurados los largos pasillos
de los cielos, bienaventurada la gelatina en los refrigeradores,
el café instantáneo. Bienaventurados en su condena de plata y flor.
Bienaventurados sean."
"Someday, Again","I’m waiting for the words        to catch up to my heart    which is 
elliptical at the moment            there’s an apology 
even I am expecting to bore out of my throat
                                                                         but what for            what for 
I am continuing to write in a font        that displeasures me 
            everything shifts so rapidly
my body           the environment           my body            the environment
why not return to something as aggressively unspectacular as arial
a font for all my first thoughts             today I typed the words
                                     “someday, again”
and deleted and retyped                                   deleted and retyped
inside of the collapse                I am still holding on to narrative
            this is not sentiment                 it is how I keep my family together
when I breathe in deep enough I feel it            all the old anger 
waiting to become newer anger            not having the words 
can feel like not having something to hit          I think I wrote that in another poem 
            before
what is the equation that solves everything       ideas are commodity 
            even the idea that ideas are commodity            I don’t even know 
what I have to sell        I’ve spent my entire life living on a fault line
            I know all that’s been made is inherently broken.
This is not me being dour        this is me writing a note
that says I miss you                              I meant that the other way
but the one you were thinking works, too"
I Give You My Heart,"I find myself on my feet with fifteen leaves.
Everything carries its own light on the walls.
I woke up being hit. The afternoon,
suffocating as the death of cows. My heart
was opened between cemeteries of moon.
The parasites. The drizzle. The mud crowning
the undergrowth with immense sadness.
I knew death when I dressed
in my uniform.
I found the index of solitude: my country in its legal
jargon, its piety, its fiction—
Yes. It loves me, really.
I give my blood as the blood of all fish.
    Os doy mi corazón
  Me encuentro de pie con quince hojas.
Brilla todo en los muros.
Desperté al ser golpeado. La tarde,
asfixiante como la muerte de vacas. Mi corazón
lo abrían entre cementerios de luna.
Los parásitos. La llovizna. El lodo coronando
la maleza con mustios grandes.
Supe de la muerte al vestir
de uniforme.
Encontré el índice de soledad: mi país en su jerga
legal, su piedad, su ficción—
Sí. Me quiere, de verdad.
Doy mi sangre como la sangre de todos los peces."
An Obscure Meadow Lures Me,"An obscure meadow lures me,
her fast, close-fitting lawns
revolve in me, sleep on my balcony.
They rule her reaches, her indefinite
alabaster dome re-creates itself.
On the waters of a mirror,
the voice cut short crossing a hundred paths,
my memory prepares surprise:
fallow deer in the sky, dew, sudden flash.
Without hearing I’m called:
I slowly enter the meadow,
proudly consumed in a new labyrinth.
Illustrious remains:
a hundred heads, bugles, a thousand shows
baring their sky, their silent sunflower.
Strange the surprise in that sky
where unwillingly footfalls turn
and voices swell in its pregnant center.
An obscure meadow goes by.
Between the two, wind or thin paper,
the wind, the wounded wind of this death,
this magic death, one and dismissed.
A bird, another bird, no longer trembles.

Jubba,"My Jubba waiting dere fe me;

To a Comrade,"Little comrade, never min’

Little comrade, moan not so,
Oh, you fill my heart with woe!
Sad I listen to your cries,
Can’t you ope your burnin’ eyes?
Little comrade, though ’tis hot,
Say you will revenge him not:
Talk not thus, you mek me grieve,
Promise me you will forgive.
Little comrade, never min’
Though a brother is unkin’;

And shall for many a day."
To Bennie,"(In Answer to a Letter)
You say, dearest comrade, my love has grown
      cold,
But you are mistaken, it burns as of old;
And no power below, dearest lad, nor above,
Can ever lessen, frien’ Bennie, my love.
Could you but look in my eyes, you would see
That ’tis a wrong thought you have about me;
Could you but feel my hand laid on your head,
Never again would you say what you’ve said.
Naught, O my Bennie, our friendship can sever,
Dearly I love you, shall love you for ever;
Moment by moment my thoughts are of you,
Trust me, oh, trust me, for aye to be true."
My Mountain Home,"De mango tree in yellow bloom,

An’ growin’ up, with sweet freedom
    About de yard I’d run;
An’ tired out I’d hide me from
    De fierce heat of de sun.
So glad I was de fus’ day when
    Ma sent me to de spring;
I was so happy feelin’ then
    Dat I could do somet’ing.
De early days pass quickly ’long,
    Soon I became a man,
An’ one day found myself among

My little joys, my wholesome min’,
    Dey bullied out o’ me,
And made me daily mourn an’ pine
    An’ wish dat I was free.
Dey taught me to distrust my life,

For months I travailed in de strife,
    ’Fo’ I could find relief.

Remember that my heart is near,

A Country Girl,"“Lelia gal, why in this town do you stay?
Why, tell me, why did you wander away?
Why will you aimlessly foolishly roam,
Won’t you come back to your old country home?”
“Country life, Fed, has no pleasures for me,
I wanted de gay o’de city to see,
To wear ebery Sunday a prettier gown,
Da’s why I came to de beautiful town.”
“Well, have you gotten de joys dat you sought?
If so, were not all o’dem too dearly bought?
Yes, Liel, you do wear a prettier dress,
But have you not suffered, my girl, more or less?
“Hold up your head! look not down, tell me truth,
Have you not bartered your innocent youth?
Are you de Lelia, true Lelia, of old,
Or have you swopped out your honour for gold?”
“Fed, it was horrid de lone country life!
I suffered––for sometimes e’en hunger was rife;
An’ when I came, Fed, to try my chance here,
I thought there would be no more troubles to bear.
“But troubles there were an’ in plenty, my lad,
Oh, dey were bitter, an’ oh, I was sad!
Weary an’ baffled an’ hungry an’ lone,
I gave up my spirit to sigh an’ to moan.
“After dat?––O, Feddy, press me not so:
De truth?––well, I sank to de lowest of de low;
I gave up all honour, I took a new name
An’ tried to be happy, deep sunk in de shame.
“Dere was no other way, Fed, I could live,
Dat was de gift dat a gay town could give;
I tried to be glad in de open daylight,
But sorrowed an’ moaned in de deep o’de night.
“No, Fed, I never could go home again:
‘Worse than I left it?’ ah, there was de pain,
To meet up wid some o’ my former schoolmates
An’ listen to all o’ deir taunts an’ deir hates.

“Dere now, you bound me to tell you o’ all,
Of all de sad suff’rings dat led to my fall; I’m gone past reclaiming, so what must I do But live de bad life an’ mek de good go?”
“Lelia, I want you to come out de sin,
Come home an’try a new life fe begin;
Mek up you min’, gal, fe wuk wid you’ han’,
Plant peas an’ corn in de fat country lan’.
“Dere is no life, gal, so pleasant, so good,
Contended and happy you’ll eat your lee food;
No one at home know ’bout wha’ you’ve jes’ said,
So, Liel, of exposure you needn’t be ’fraid.”
“Don’t t’ink I care ’bout exposure, my boy!
Dat which you call sin is now fe me joy;
Country for Lelia will have no more charm,
I’ll live on de same way, ’twill do me no harm.
“And after all, many gals richer than me,
Pretty white girlies of better degree,
Live as I do, an’ are happy an’ gay,
Then why should not I be as happy as they?”"
Ribber Come-Do’n,"From de top o’ Clarendon hill

While a six-week-old baby wailed,
    An’ wailed for a mudder to come.
An’ a fader too was away
    ’Cross de Minha wukin’ him groun’,
So him couldn’ get home dat night
    Sake o’ de ribber come-do’n.
Dere were four udder little ones
    ’Sides de babe of six weeks old,
An’ dey cried an’ looked to no use,
    An’ oh dey were hungry an’ cold!
So de lee fourteen-year-old gal,
    De eldest one o’ de lot,
Was sad as she knelt by the babe
    An’ bayed her on de cot.
            “Bya, bya, me baby,
             Baby want go sleepy.”
She look ’pon de Manchinic tree,
    Not a piece of mancha fe eat;
De Jack-fruit dem bear well anuff,
    But dere wasn’t one o’dem fit.
Nor puppa nor mumma could come,
    Aldough it be’n now nightfall;
De rain pour do’n an’ de wind blow,
    An’ de picknanies dem still bawl.
So de poo’ Milly ’tarted out
    To whe’ a kin’ neighbor lib,
Fe see ef a bite o’ nenyam
    Dem couldn’ p’raps manage fe gib.
     “Ebenin’, cousin Anna,
      Me deh beg you couple banna,
For dem tarra one is berry hungry home;
    We puppa ober May, ma,
    We mumma gone a Bay, ma,
An’ we caan’ tell warra time dem gwin’ go

The kind district mother thought
    Of her own boy far away,
An’ wondered much how he fared
    In a foreign land that day.
She opened de cuphoard door
    An’ took from it warra be’n sabe,
A few bits o’ yam an’ lee meal,
    An’ a pint o’ milk fe de babe.
De parents dat night couldn’ come,
    De howlin’ wind didn’ lull,
But de picknanies went to bed
    Wid a nuff nuff bellyful."
Moonlight on Manila Bay,"A light, serene, ethereal glory rests
Its beams effulgent on each crestling wave;
The silver touches of the moonlight wave
The deep bare bosom that the breeze molests;
While lingering whispers deepen as the wavy crests
Roll with weird rhythm, now gay, now gently grave;
And floods of lambent light appear the sea to pave—
All cast a spell that heeds not time’s behests.
Not always such the scene; the din of fight
Has swelled the murmur of the peaceful air;
Here East and West have oft displayed their might;
Dark battle clouds have dimmed this scene so fair;
Here bold Olympia, one historic night,
Presaging freedom, claimed a people’s care."
Nude Kneeling in Sand,"The girl in the sand
colored hat
of unfinished straw
with its sides of waves
of water weaving
in the winds of her
yellow hair, her eyes
hives of bees, touch-
es her breasts toward her knees.
Like a child she digs
and buries 
her thin hands in the
desirable flesh
colored sands, as small
animals or pairs
of birds that wait to
rise and stir scat-
tering streams of amber myrrh.
Out of ecstasy
her bright mouth
opens to the sun
as she lifts herself
to it and rests, with 
breasts sweet and full, back
beautifully curved,
arms down, lap and
loins packed with moist, golden coin.
 "
New York Scene: May 1958,"It is just getting dark as the rain stops.
He walks slow and looks, though he’s late. It’s all
Muted. It’s like a stage. A tender light
In the street, a freshness. He wonders, a
Funeral?: at uncertain intervals,
Up the block, the corner, small, old women
Walk home with soft lamps, holding them with love
Like children before them in the May night.
A few people move down East 10th Street. They
Do not look at these ladies with their lights
Blowing in the rain-wet airs by the stores,
Their ancient hands guarding their ancient flames.
Three boys race out of the YMCA
At the corner, carrying the brief god-
like gear of the runner. Two jackets hunch
Over two kids. There is high, choked laughter.
The third wears a sweater, black as his head
Lit with the wet. They sprint across the street,
And are gone into a tiny candy shop
Half underneath the walk. A dialogue
As the jackets and sweater cross leaves him
One clean phrase, “tomorrow again.” He grins.
He turns, pauses by a store with small tools
Held in half spool boxes in the window,
With beads, clocks, one hand-turned coffee grinder
And way in the back, a wooden Indian.
Now he stops a girl he feels he knows. He
Asks her where he’s going, gives an address. 
She teaches him, lifting her arm up, rais-
ing a breast inside her poplin raincoat.
He listens carelessly. He wants to see
The long, full hair that gives form to her scarf
Of a wine and golden colored woolen,
Some turns of it loose about her forehead
Like a child, some lengths of it falling at
Her back as she walks away, having smiled. "
Byron at Shelley’s Burning,"The brain of Shelley cooks
Inside its smoking case; 
The bones and flesh fall off
And show the seed of Shelley’s thought.
The wine of Byron fumes
Inside his cup of skull;
The lengthy hair of Percy
Streams on his romantic pyre.
The scissor legs of Byron
Swim where Shelley drowned
In wine romantic seas
Of Italy. And Byron notes
The wine red beauty
In the sheets of flame
Of Shelley, as he sees
The body burn upon the beach.
But Byron’s brain could not
Foresee how he would die
In Greece, his blood ebbing
Into his eye out of a drunken leech."
For My Nephew Going to Bed,"It takes a whole house to put a child to bed.
I wonder what he dreams worth all the business
Of washing, inspecting, kissing, and being carried
Pick-a-back for all the aunts to witness
He’s one day older and on his way like us all
To being sorry for it. I recall
Times when a smile was its own good moral:
Laugh and the world’s half saved,
Be gently thoughtful, wash, comb, eat your cereal,
And God will always know you’re well behaved
And must not be aimed at by unemployment, shrapnel,
Eviction, delirium tremens, or sin’s black market,
Nor be allowed to grow like your uncle—mad
With measuring our unbalanced etiquette,
Where normally to put one child to bed
Takes more commotion than half the world’s corpses get.
While I stand stupid-solemn, a little daft,
Surprised that I have this much pity left.
 "
George Washington Bridge,"The buttresses of morning lift the sun
Across an arc of steel and flying piers.
The twin cadenzas of the cables run
Like landless gulls across the hemispheres.
Out of a step of mist the caisson root
Spires from the consonant rock to the vowel of sky,
The highway rings the morning underfoot
Scoring the traffic for a symphony.
And arc and piers and highway soar from steel
Into a swinging web of flying sound.
A gull’s geometry, a flashing keel,
A flowering ceremony of the ground.
The men who climbed like birds to trap that wire,
Like birds were born to know what song and flight meant:
The tempo of an arc, curve of a choir,
The eye’s adagio and the blood’s excitement."
"Night Freight, Michigan","Punctual to the midnight—lurch, ruck and chime—
The fast freight breaks from the night and under
The sooted bridges stamps earth and away east.…
Windows rattle in their putty and the house shakes
And across the trembling of the dollar alarm clock on the dresser,
Heart, with the certainty of resolved analogy, discovers
The quivering of secret elm root about rock,
The trembling of river bank and the shuttering lip of water,
And on the hillside the running and sifting down of soil
Through dark and silent mazes of hay stubble.
Earth, indigenous engine, robot to all physic,
Answers to all force and it is good.
Great meter of the footfalls of men and the tug of stars,
Calibrating, in the shifting of an elm’s clutch on sunken boulder,
The shaking of putty in the pane and river from bank, the settling
Of Time across the dial and soil on the hills;
The passage of one trainload of tires, refrigerators, and hobos
From Kalamazoo to the Junction."
Winter Music,"November and trees blown bare and leaves stippling
The autumn-stripping wind and trees futilely fingering
Lee-wind after down-streaming foliage…
The bright birds are gone and their small and excellent music,
The nests unleafed and visible to ridicule of sparrows and pigeons…
Now turn. From no feathered throat shall be this winter’s music.
Nor from memories of music in deserted nests.
Now turn to wind’s cry in the bent trees and the granite gaps,
And in the city clattering the billboards together,
And furious between houses flinging the snow against frosted snow.
Turn here to this extravagance for voice and music.
Open imagination to the clash of gigantic air.
For wisdom, there is the sunlight falling unbent across such fury."
Gitanjali 15,"I am here to sing thee songs. In this hall of thine I have a corner seat.
In thy world I have no work to do; my useless life can only break out in tunes without a purpose.
When the hour strikes for thy silent worship at the dark temple of midnight, command me, my master, to stand before thee to sing.
When in the morning air the golden harp is tuned, honour me, commanding my presence."
Gitanjali 14,"My desires are many and my cry is pitiful, but ever didst thou save me by hard refusals; and this strong mercy has been wrought into my life through and through.
Day by day thou art making me worthy of the simple, great gifts that thou gavest to me unasked—this sky and the light, this body and the life and the mind—saving me from perils of overmuch desire.
There are times when I languidly linger and times when I awaken and hurry in search of my goal; but cruelly thou hidest thyself from before me.
Day by day thou art making me worthy of thy full acceptance by refusing me ever and anon, saving me from perils of weak, uncertain desire."
Gitanjali 13,"The song that I came to sing remains unsung to this day.
I have spent my days in stringing and in unstringing my instrument.
The time has not come true, the words have not been rightly set; only there is the agony of wishing in my heart.
The blossom has not opened; only the wind is sighing by.
I have not seen his face, nor have I listened to his voice; only I have heard his gentle footsteps from the road before my house.
The livelong day has passed in spreading his seat on the floor; but the lamp has not been lit and I cannot ask him into my house.
I live in the hope of meeting with him; but this meeting is not yet."
Gitanjali 12,"The time that my journey takes is long and the way of it long.
I came out on the chariot of the first gleam of light, and pursued my voyage through the wildernesses of worlds leaving my track on many a star and planet.
It is the most distant course that comes nearest to thyself, and that training is the most intricate which leads to the utter simplicity of a tune.
The traveller has to knock at every alien door to come to his own, and one has to wander through all the outer worlds to reach the innermost shrine at the end.
My eyes strayed far and wide before I shut them and said “Here art thou!”
The question and the cry “Oh, where?” melt into tears of a thousand streams and deluge the world with the flood of the assurance “I am!”"
Gitanjali 11,"Leave this chanting and singing and telling of beads! Whom dost thou worship in this lonely dark corner of a temple with doors all shut? Open thine eyes and see thy God is not before thee!
He is there where the tiller is tilling the hard ground and where the path-maker is breaking stones. He is with them in sun and in shower, and his garment is covered with dust. Put off thy holy mantle and even like him come down on the dusty soil!
Deliverance? Where is this deliverance to be found? Our master himself has joyfully taken upon him the bonds of creation; he is bound with us all for ever.
Come out of thy meditations and leave aside thy flowers and incense! What harm is there if thy clothes become tattered and stained? Meet him and stand by him in toil and in sweat of thy brow."
Gitanjali 10,"Here is thy footstool and there rest thy feet where live the poorest, and lowliest, and lost.
When I try to bow to thee, my obeisance cannot reach down to the depth where thy feet rest among the poorest, and lowliest, and lost
Pride can never approach to where thou walkest in the clothes of the humble among the poorest, and lowliest, and lost.
My heart can never find its way to where thou keepest company with the companionless among the poorest, the lowliest, and the lost."
Gitanjali 9,"O fool, to try to carry thyself upon thy own shoulders! O beggar, to come to beg at thy own door!
Leave all thy burdens on his hands who can bear all, and never look behind in regret.
Thy desire at once puts out the light from the lamp it touches with its breath. It is unholy—take not thy gifts through its unclean hands. Accept only what is offered by sacred love."
Gitanjali 8,"The child who is decked with prince’s robes and who has jewelled chains round his neck loses all pleasure in his play; his dress hampers him at every step.
In fear that it may be frayed, or stained with dust he keeps himself from the world, and is afraid even to move.
Mother, it is no gain, thy bondage of finery, if it keep one shut off from the healthful dust of the earth, if it rob one of the right of entrance to the great fair of common human life."
Letter to Mother,"It was good. You found your America. It was worth all
The coming: the fading figures in the never-again doorway,
The rankness of steerage, the landing in fog.
Yes, and the tenement, the reek and shouting in the streets
All that night and the terror. It was good, it was all good.
It is important only that you came.
And it is good to remember that this blood, in another body,
       your body, arrived.
There is dynastic example in a single generation of this blood,
       and the example good,
But, Mother, I can promise you nothing.
This traveling is across the sprung longitudes of the mind
And the blood’s latitudes. I have made a sextant of heart
And nailed my bearings to sun, but from the look-out
There is no hailing yet of the hoped-for land.
On the enormous, wheeling, imperative sea,
And the high example of this earlier coming—
But there will be no Americas discovered by analogy.
 "
Yellow Moon,"I stand at my window and listen;
Only the plaintive murmur of a swarm of cicadas.
I stand on the wet grass and ponder,
And turn to the east and behold you,
Great yellow moon.
Why do you frighten me so,
You captive of the coconut glade?
I have seen you before,
Have flirted with you so many a night.
When my heart, ever throbbing, never listless,
Had pined for the moonlight to calm it.
But you were a dainty whiteness
That kissed my brow then.
A gentle, pale flutter
That touched my aching breast.
You are a lonely yellow moon now.
You are ghastly, spectral tonight,
Alone
Behind your prison bars of coconut trees.
That is why
I do not dare take you into my hand
And press you against my cheek
To feel how cold you are.
I am afraid of you, yellow moon."
Mentor,"           “death cannot harm me
            more than you have harmed me,
            my beloved life.”
                        —Louise Glück 
I tell my daughter first, because her knowing  
forces it to become true. I have to leave dad.  
Nothing is going to change. She nods  
like a priest in a booth, the last fifteen years
staring down at us. Explains, softly, 
how she’s spoken of me to her therapist.
Her worry of becoming my mirror. Tells me, 
I remember you, mom, before him. You were happy.
Oh. Oh. To surrender to your death by someone else’s
hand is still a kind of suicide. Slower. I stand naked
on the porch as she recounts in perfect detail,
(in a poet’s detail) the very things I’d hoped
to disguise. My careful little spectator. Diligent neighbor 
to my unnamed agonies. It is not ungrateful to resist
the tyrannies of obsession. It is no selfish act 
to want, suddenly, to stay alive. My dear girl.
She is teaching and I am learning. I not only  
want to be seen, I want to be seen through.
I return to my house, haunted and waiting. 
I look into the mirror and notice the door."
Selkie Weaning Young (Redux),"Finding her hide we trailed 
                                    fingers down then against  
             grains of fur thrusting shoulders into its waxy skin. 
                                                                This is how she found us 
                           the past draped about us like a cloak 
hands separating peach halves from a core. 
                                   Her form in the sound 
a pandan leaf peeking through milk. The only seals in Vietnam: 
                                                                   American men with green faces."
Evening,"Another word I love is evening
for the balance it implies, balance
being something I struggle with.
I suppose I would like to be more
a planet, turning in & out of light
It comes down again to polarities,
equilibrium. Evening. The moths
take the place of the butterflies,
owls the place of hawks, coyotes
for dogs, stillness for business,
& the great sorrow of brightness
makes way for its own sorrow.
Everything dances with its strict
negation, & I like that. I have no
choice but to like that. Systems
are evening out all around us—
even now, as we kneel before
a new & ruthless circumstance.
Where would I like to be in five
years, someone asks—& what
can I tell them? Surrendering
with grace to the evening, with
as much grace as I can muster
to the circumstance of darkness,
which is only something else
that does not stay."
My Mom’s Been Asking for a Happy Poem All My Life,"So I fight all my destructive urges to give her one. A tiny globe
filled with first snow I’m determined not to shatter across blacktop.
Once, in the parking lot of Home Depot, we got into the blue van
& everything felt off, uncanny, a fast-food wrapper from a place 
we hadn’t eaten, the dashboard dustier than it should’ve been. 
It took us a full thirty seconds, Mom in the driver’s
seat though she hadn’t driven in years, me in the passenger, her ride-
or-die since I was a little girl & one of her only friends in our strange &
tiny border town, before we realized This isn’t our van! & we scrambled
out, laughing our heads off & terrified the owner 
had called the cops on the women who look like twins 
carjacking them. We laugh about it every time we’re in a parking lot. 
That wasn’t our only Lucy & Ethel moment. There was the time 
we ordered what we thought was a roll from the drive-
thru at Panera Bread, thinking we’d share it to split the calories 
but when the server handed it to us, the long, thin bread kept
coming through the window. Mom & I thought 
baguette meant roll, it sounded petit. & although this poem’s 
only point is to make Mom happy it’s also to heal
something in myself I hadn’t known needed a balm until the words
hit the page, the way moms know, the way mine sent me flowers 
when the love of my young life got another girl pregnant & left me 
heartbroken & without a prom date, or when Mom gave me a gold
nutcracker pin after the ballet recital when all the other girls got
flowers & I shoved the beautiful pin back at her because it wasn’t flowers.
And she said flowers wilt. I wanted to get you something 
that would last forever. Like her love. A poem can be sentimental 
because poems are filled with life, but sometimes we need to look
our moms in the eyes & apologize. Or say thank you.
Our moms remind us what it felt like when we were safe
in their arms, even if our moms weren’t safe, even 
if they were only holding it together for us, to give us a happiness
they’d created from thin air. Motherhood is made of that
magic. I’m crying now. Mom, I promise, they’re happy tears."
Brothers,"  translated from Early Modern Irish by Seamus Heaney
You who opt for English ways
And crop your curls, your crowning glory,
You, my handsome specimen,
Are no true son of Donncha’s.
If you were, you would not switch
To modes in favour with the English;
You, the flower of Fódla’s land,
Would never end up barbered.
A full head of long, fair hair
Is not for you; it is your brother
Who scorns the foreigners’ close cut.
The pair of you are opposites.
Eoghan Bán won’t ape their ways,
Eoghan beloved of noble ladies
Is enemy to English fads
And lives beyond the pale of fashion.
Eoghan Bán is not like you.
Breeches aren’t a thing he values.
A clout will do him for a cloak.
Leggings he won’t wear, nor greatcoat.
He hates the thought of jewelled spurs
Flashing on his feet and footwear,
And stockings of the English sort,
And being all prinked up and whiskered.
He’s Donncha’s true son, for sure.
He won’t be seen with a rapier
Angled like an awl, out arseways,
As he swanks it to the meeting place.
Sashes worked with threads of gold
And high stiff collars out of Holland
Are not for him, nor satin scarves
That sweep the ground, nor gold rings even.
He has no conceit in feather beds,
Would rather stretch himself on rushes,
Dwell in a bothy than a bawn,
And make the branch his battlement.
Horsemen in the mouth of a glen,
A savage dash, kernes skirmishing –
This man is in his element
Taking on the foreigner.
But you are not like Eoghan Bán.
You’re a laughing stock on stepping stones
With your dainty foot: a sad disgrace,
You who opt for English ways."
As if,"As if the light itself
Were merely a plant, as if the stars
Sent down their thin rays
Like capillary roots
Sucking at me, to extract
Their mysterious nutrient.
Astral blooms flock to the scalpel
Like crows to the plough.
The size of this field of light scares me.
With so many flowers to feed, I’m worn
To the bone, fulfilled and woozy with love.
And whom can I call for assistance?
Will nobody rid me, root, stem and branch,
Of this star-sprouting garden,
Burst the galactic, numinous dykes
And make way for the ocean of darkness?"
Loneliness,"  translated from Romanian by Seamus Heaney
Loneliness is a town
Where everyone else is dead.
The streets are clean,
The street-markets empty,
Suddenly everything’s in a true light
Through being deserted – exactly
The way it was meant to be.
Loneliness is a city
Where it’s always snowing  
Prodigiously, and no footsteps ever
Profane the layered
Drift of the light.
And you alone, the unsleeping eye
Keeping an eye on the sleepers, you  
See, comprehend, and can’t have enough
Of a silence so pristine
Nobody fights there,
Nobody’s lied to,
And even the tear in the eye  
Of the abandoned animal
Is too pure to hurt.
On the border
Between suffering and death,
Loneliness is a happy town."
哀 / Sad,
The morning after I die,"  translated from Romanian by Seamus Heaney
The morning after I die
Will be cool, like those misty September dawns
When the dog-days are over
And I blink awake in white air, making strange
At a woolly light in the trees.
And because it’s September, I’ll have come to
Very early and – again like September –
Be lonely enough to keep hearing
The air drip-dripping towards noon  
Down the wet cheeks of quinces;
I’ll be in a drowse,
Praying to get back to sleep
For a little while longer,
Lying there, never moving,  
Eyes closed, my face in the pillow,
As the deafening silence beats louder
And louder and wakens me up more and more.
The start
Of that eternal day
Will be like a morning in autumn."
Do you remember the beach,"  translated from Romanian by Seamus Heaney
Do you remember the beach
Covered with splintered glass,
That beach
Where we couldn’t walk barefoot?
And the way you would gaze
At the sea, and gaze, all absorbed, and say
You were listening to me?
Do you remember
The gulls going wild, wheeling
Round and round as the bells
Chimed out behind us somewhere
In churches that had
Fish for their patron saints?
And how you headed away
At a run
Towards the surf, yelling back
That you needed distance
To be able to see me.
Then the gulls,
The swirl of the snow,
The spray, all of them mingled,
And I would look on
With a kind of desperate elation
As your feet marked the sea,
The sea that would close like an eyelid then
Where I waited and looked."
That Morning after the Assassination of Malcolm X,"“Terror on every side! Denounce him! Let us denounce him!”
All my friends are waiting for me to slip. They say,
“Perhaps he will be deceived; then we will prevail
over him and take our revenge on him.” Jeremiah 20:10
“Get back on the train,” he said. “Then go back
downtown to 59th, and take the Number One.”
He was in his mid-fifties, I think, the man behind
the booth. Brown, soft spoken, eyes down.
“Then take the train back uptown to 116th
and get off at Columbia University.” He told
me this I have come to see to keep me
from getting off the train there in Harlem
on that dead and silent morning. No, I told
myself. After all, I was already up at 116th.
Easier to just walk up the subway steps, cut through
the park at Morningside and on to the campus.
This was February 22nd, 1965,
a bright crisp Monday morning. I’d come up
on the subway from Hunter to get a copy
of How to Read French which the adjunct at Hunter
had assigned us. One more way of talking 
I’d have to learn to pass my PhD exam come fall.
One more piece of that jagged jigsaw puzzle
I’d have to fit together if I was ever going to earn
my degree in English and Comp Lit from the dons
at the City University of New York.
Understand: I was a week shy of my twenty-fifth,
married now eighteen months, and living
in a two-family apartment on Booth Memorial
out in far-flung Flushing, our firstborn
already well on his way. The fact that a Black
man named Malcolm X had just been killed
with a blast from a hidden sawed-off shotgun
the afternoon before at the Audubon Ballroom
north of here in Harlem had registered, I think,
but barely. But what had any of this to do with me?
This was New York City, you have to understand,
and this was the Sixties. And what did I know
anyway about this Malcolm with that X in place of
some white slave master’s name? And wasn’t this
the guy who, when JFK was shot down in Dallas
fifteen months before, had said how the chickens
had finally come home to roost? The same man
who’d called Cassius Clay (now, thanks to him
Muhammed Ali) his close friend until they too
had parted ways (to Ali’s too-late regret)? The man
who once took on William Buckley in that debate about
white privilege, and won? Only after I got my prized
degree and moved on to teach up in Amherst did I
begin to put the pieces of the puzzle back together
when I came at last to teach Malcolm’s autobiography,
and learned what courage the man had to have to face
down the rank corruption in the leader he’d followed
for a dozen years, the prophet Elijah Muhammed,
and turned instead to Mecca for the strength
he saw the faithful offered so he could carry on,
in spite of being targeted by the FBI
and New York’s Finest, the dark side of human
nature being what it is. Add to all of this his beloved
Betty there on that stage with him, mother of their
four daughters, with two more on the way, whom
he would never live to see. Add too the gunshot
wounds to his chest, left shoulder, arms and legs,
the blood gurgling from his mouth as he lay dying.
And hadn’t the leader of the Nation, miffed at
Malcolm’s leaving, made it known how the man
was now a traitor and so must die. And if he himself
washed his hands of the job, not so his followers.
And now Malcolm X Shabazz was dead.
Though not his message. No, not what he had
had to learn the hard way, about the cost of learning
to love your brother, black, brown or even white.
That ice-cold morning, as I walked the ghostlike streets
of Harlem toward the looming Heights, two young
Black men in dark suits stood there on the sidewalk
talking, surprised to see a white man like myself
with a briefcase in his hand walking there, even as
it dawned on me that I might well be in the wrong
place at the wrong time. And here’s the thing: like two
angels, they stared, winked, parted, and let me pass."
Poor Fauvette,"Jules Bastien-Lepage, Poor Fauvette, 1881
Late winter, and the little girl stares off, her gaze
reaching down into your soul. She’s wrapped
herself in a makeshift shawl of brown cloth
to ward off the cold this very morning, as she stands
there in some wintry field out in Damvillers,
minding the family cow as it feeds on straw and thistle.
“There are some glorious pictures,” D.H. Lawrence
wrote a friend, after viewing the canvas at a winter
exhibition some thirty years after Bastien-Lepage
painted the scene, the artist himself long since gone.
But nothing caught his eye like this scene, as he watched
the lovely woman in her smart, dark velvet suit
and hat, its feathers flowing down over her shoulders,
a woman so unlike that poor Fauvette. “Too sad,”
the woman whispered, as she confided to the man
beside her there. “But then that is what the country
does to one.” And now, the moment over, the two
moved on to yet another landscape, and then another.
And here’s the thing: it’s the gaze of that little girl,
isn’t it, that embeds itself upon your heart, before you too
find yourself likewise turn away. How many times
have you been stopped when you least expected
by someone asking you to look at them and listen?
Like the daughter of an old friend, himself long gone,

catching you in the frozen parking lot of the old brick
church just after Mass this morning, when all you
wanted was to climb inside your car for warmth,
her face and yours masked by this pandemic,
though her teary eyes spoke volumes as she began
to speak of the deep rifts between her brother and herself.
And what was there for you to do but listen in that
freezing morning. Pain is pain. Pain is personal. Still,
you’ve learned to listen, which somehow seems to help.
To help the other, as it helps your sorry self just to know
you care. Something that seems to repeat itself more
and more now, giving back something of yourself.
Like that bread just offered you, which you consumed
before you left the parking lot to head back home for
coffee, eggs and toast. Which is more than what poor
Fauvette will feast on when she returns this evening
back home, cold and weary, to sup on her daily bread,
if that, both those gazes etched now on your heart."
Those Beloved Ghosts of Compiano,"Wallace Stevens, late in life, evoking the ghost
of Coleridge, another poet philosopher, then
in his twenties, starting out on a packet bound
for Germany, invited by some Danes to share a drink.
He was dressed in black, with large shoes and worsted
stockings, so that they mistook him for some Methodist
on a mission, though the fact was he was on his way
to Göttingen to learn what language has to teach us.
“Doctor Teology?” they joked, half drunk and having
one hell of a time up on the deck. No, he said, no,
he wasn’t that. Then what? “Un philosophe, perhaps?”
No, he said. That was the last thing he thought himself
as being, though that in fact was what he was.
Well, they laughed, weren’t we all philosophers?
And with that he joined them for a song until all rose
“as one and danced on the deck a set of dances.”
O happy day, when the philosopher and the poet
could sing and dance together, a cup of wine held high
in your hand, as angelheaded hipster Danes danced on
and the river flowed on and on beneath your feet
and evening descended gently with each passing moment....
Each night now, as this plague keeps descending on us,
refusing to let go, my dreams turn strange and stranger,
as if I were some blind Orion searching for the rising sun.
Like you, I’m on a journey, though where I’m going
changes with each moment. Sometimes I’m in a car
driving with my wife beside me, who’s there until she isn’t.
Or I’m on a plane, every last seat empty now,
my destination unknown even to the pilot.
Or I’m on a boat, watching peasants dance
their madcap turns like the ones you see in Breughel’s
Kermess, as some unheard music goes reeling on. 
                                                                                       
Mostly, though, I’m just walking, one step followed
by another. Sometimes there’s a stranger walking
there beside me, but who never says a word.
And then—like that—there’s no one there but me,
and I’m thinking to myself that if I just keep
moving on, I’ll get to where I’m going.
The trouble is I don’t seem to know where it is
I’m going, or even if there’s any place to get to....
When I was four, I remember walking with my father,
taking one giant step and then another to keep up.
We went bounding up First Avenue ten blocks to 61st,
one row of tenements after the other, till we came
to where he’d lived, though the building itself
had disappeared to make room for an exit off the bridge.
Old men he’d known with toothless grins sat on stools,
greeting us with that Val di Taro patois of theirs.

It was the spring of ‘44, and the Army
had finally called him up. And though some who’d
grown up with him would not survive the war,
he made it through, walking draftees through
the intricacies of carburetors and air-fuel induction.
And now here we were, my father come this one
last time for a glass of wine and to say his ave
atque vale. Hello, compaesani. And now goodbye.
Fifty years before, his parents sailed here to America,
where the streets they’d heard were paved with gold,
though the only paving my nonno ever knew
was the tar he laid, until the asbestos pulled him under.
Compiano was the town they’d hailed from. Giuseppe first,
then Giulia, who brought their firstborn with her. Primo,
run over at the entrance to this very Bridge the day after
Christmas, 1907. He’d just turned twelve.
                                                                                                                    
In time others in the family sank from history too, infants
mostly, what with cholera, pneumonia and the rest.
Mary, with that large bow in her hair, made it to fifteen,
almost surviving the Spanish Flu before they lost her.
My father, who was three then, told me how he’d sat
there on her coffin, lost in the back of a horse-drawn
wagon, as they readied Mary for her final trip across
the 59th Street Bridge to Queens and Calvary.
I have walked the streets of Compiano twice now, once
with my own son, Paul, and once with Allen, poet
philosopher, who spoke in his polished Italian with the local
priest to learn what little could be gleaned of those belovèd
ghosts I know now only through a few inscriptions in the local
registry, much of the story, like so many others, burned
by German soldiers as they left the town behind them
in the spring of ’45 and headed back across the mountains.
Still, what would I say to them, these beloved ghosts
of Compiano, if I should meet them? Or those others
who lie silent somewhere in my blood? What words,
poet philosophe, would suffice? And still the river runs
beneath my feet as they sing on and on in dreams.
Is it that, in the end, there are no words? That there are
only ghosts now who keep calling out to us, beckoning us
to rise and dance along beside them while there’s still time?"
The Poet as Eighty-Year-Old Sous-Chef,"What better way to spend my time now than to play
the sous-chef as my dear wife prepares this very day
yet another of her heavenly meals? Cinnamon yellow
squash soup with hints of fresh mint, a melting mellow
eggplant Parmigian’, chicken a la Francaise,
crumb apple pie. Ah, lucky me, to have been chosen
to dice the scallions and onions, peel the potatoes,
gather from our little garden parsley, basil and some thyme,
then back inside to uncork a bottle of three-star wine.
Oh, to put aside the books that keep staring up at me
clamoring to be read: a fresh translation of the Odyssey,
Dante’s Convivio, Flannery, Chesterton, and Joyce,
as well as a dozen poets, each with his or her distinctive voice
but who too often now remain unsung. And that piles of books,
each clamoring to be blurbed and praised, as by the looks
of it they no doubt deserve. But oh, that freedom just…to be.
But be what? And now it’s half past five and she’s calling up to me.
Time, dear, she sings, to be the sous chef you were called to be."
The Other Side,"All those years you lunched with Margaret, or spent time
cooking meals together, baking cookies, batch after batch.
Meals at Thanksgiving and, yes, especially come Christmastime.
Our boys out on the lawn beneath the maples playing catch.
Oh, those years vacationing on the Cape or strolling the avenues
of Naples and ancient Pompey with its new uncovered news.
And now here we were beside her as the end drew near,
this lovely woman we’d known for over fifty years, 
her body wracked with illness after illness and so much pain.
There was her younger son, who’d flown in from Eugene
with his wife and kids to comfort her now, his guitar
strumming an old ballad about going home at last.
Her other boy was missing, no longer there for her,
and there was nothing we could do to change that now.
And there was Jim, lost in that dark moment, trying to find
something in images of Roman cemeteries, his mind
grasping for whatever Seneca or Cicero might tell him now.
Still, what did the future hold for him? The past was past.
That much we understood, as on each fleeting moment fled.
But then there you were, my dear, kneeling down beside
her as she sat hunched, staring helplessly on her bed
as suddenly you gazed into her near-vacant eyes and said,
“We’ll lunch again together, Margaret, on the other side,”
the words surprising us, until stoic Jim let go at last and cried.
And so it goes. The unanswered questions you dare not ask.
And then the moment that undoes death’s dreaded mask.
Yes, dear Margaret, we’ll lunch together on the other side."
Sixth-Grade Hockey on the Greenfield Rink,"Five then four for a ninety-second penalty
then five again down at the far end
then a hurricane of green and white
hurling this way with a pass a pivot
then what seems a pas de deux then
another pass as the puck whacks against
the see-through plastic barrier and there’s
the hawkeyed Griff modest (as always)
and steady as a chess knight skating back
back then floating sideways as the puck wheels
faster than my eyes can follow and now
he’s got it and he’s heading for their goalie
a kid so big so geared up with his blocker
in his right and his trapper in his left suited up
in his Hannibal Lector death-white face mask
so that you have to wonder how a puck slapped
even at a hundred miles an hour could ever
get past that dragon at the gate as one then two
blue blurs come closing in on him intent only
on stealing back that speck that priceless puck
at any cost as now the Griffer shifts then passes
then retrieves the spheroid thing as now
he feints off to the left then slams it there
yes there right there into the corner that
too late squeezes shut and bam!
like that it’s 1-0 and someone’s father
is banging on the plastic barrier as shouts
go roaring up from the metal bleachers
and Griffer’s grandpa’s going Woo hoo! before
he remembers to compose himself once more.
And with that the game goes on again
and soon the players morph into other kids
who look like Griff but with different strides
and numbers on their back as some skate out
though the team door and some skate in.
And soon the kids on the other team
do their quid pro quo to even up the score.
And so it goes, week in week out the winter
through, a sport you never thought to follow
until your grandson took it up, practicing it
even in his living room, where his parents
have let him set up a net on the ancient
wooden farmhouse floor into which he slams
the puck again and then again hour after hour
while good old Huddie shakes himself
then shuffles off into the other room, a game
where Griffin seems to know all the stats
and teams and players and even dreams about
in a world where grim opponents keep coming
for him, where he must somehow face
the white-masked monster and send the missive
he’s been charged with wheeling through."
Silver Moon,"Old moon rising over the Hotel David,
silvering the storied streets of Jerusalem.
Holy city, alleluia! Holy city.
Adolescent moon waving seaward beyond
Key West, glittering the palm-swayed beaches.
Acetylene moon, processing past Paterson’s
brick silk mills as they drowsed
in the evening air, half aware of the steady
roar of the Great Falls, where we played among
the rusting iron fences when we were children.
Drunken moon, that night I drove my Beta
Sigma brothers through the Bronx streets
home to their apartments, swerving left, right,
left as I sang some inane insane song, and—
thanks to you, my watchdog Guardian
Angel—have lived to talk about it.
Somnolent moon high over El Capitan, where
once a grizzly snuffled outside our cabin,
the kids thank God asleep. Moon higher
still over the Wilbur Cross Parkway,
forming a refulgent silver lake as we drove
north toward Hartford and beyond.
Brother moon, Br’er Moon, tangled
in a briar patch of clotheslines, an acrid sweetness
of baked tar coating the buckled roof
of my long-lost crumbling brownstone tenement
which once faced the beckoning diamond lights
of the Chrysler. Antediluvian moon, moon
older than Moses, older than Ashurbanipal,
than Adam even, you, the lesser light the Lord
created on the fourth day, silvering the earth.
Moon, dear moon, the comfort you bring
each time I catch you as you slowly process past,
left to right, but steadier than I was then,
royal moon choired by katydids, or peeking
through the glittered winter ice. Catch you, ah!,
whenever I climb the creaking stairs in darkness.
In truth, you seem to look down and wink at me
through the stained-glass window when I reach
the landing with its giant potted eucalyptus.
Oh I know they say you are a floating rock
pockmarked with shadow craters, half of you
forever hidden from us in darkness. Know too
there are black and white videos taken by men,
brave men surely, and all gone now, such is
our common fate, even for those few who reach
for stars, and who, half floating in their awkward
necessary lifelines, dream of touching you.
Moon, old moon, dear moon, I beg you
answer me when I call out to you,
as I have from the eerie hospital bed,
or over the lit dashboard of my car, or from
the north room where my love is sleeping now,
here next to me, as she has for fifty years
and more, constant companion, ancient
moon, as we go silvering on, alleluia."
Remembering Phil Levine,"There were times when it seemed to me even you
could almost believe something out there was waiting.
Something you called massive, irrational, yet so
powerful even the mountains had no word for it.
No, you weren’t crazy, as you liked to say. Sly, yes,
as always, but far from crazy. How often you had me
laughing so hard I had to beg you (to no avail, of course)
to please stop so I could catch my breath again.
But then, Phil, that was you. How lucky to know you,
from when we taught together up at Bread Loaf those
late summers, you talking about your brilliant teacher, John
Berryman. Or you up at the lectern, your words like lightning
as you recalled those years hauling furniture up flights
of rickety stairs for some old couple, or working those
punch presses in Detroit. Or those years teaching at Fresno,
where you transformed the lives of so many students.
Or the two of us strolling through that SoHo gallery with those
black and white photos of Spain’s anarchists your friends
fought alongside back then, some never coming back home.
Your words for Ascaso, a man of stone resting now among those stones.
Or those long talks when you taught down in New York, living in that
high rise Village apartment with Franny, you reciting “Do Not Go
Gently into That Good Night,” the whole poem by heart,
in a way that could turn even an agnostic into a believer.
Or your time on Brooklyn’s Willow Street, as we strolled south
along the darkening East River, and I kept recalling that
tenement and first home on East 51st.  Still, this was Hart
Crane’s world, the one he transformed from gray grit
into a paradise I could almost believe in, as we gazed on
Lady Liberty and the Brooklyn Bridge and dusk descended
that autumn night and you stopped a couple of young
Brits and asked them to take a picture of the two of us.
Or that last meal we had together with dear Franny
at some Polish restaurant you both loved a few blocks over.
Then, as we finished, me saying it was time we got the bill
and you saying, no, it was time for me to get the bill.
Then the three of us walking to the subway under
the streetlights as I headed back into Manhattan that night,
you jabbing me with those one-liners, and you grabbed
my arm, as if this might well be our last time together.
And then that final call to Fresno as Franny held the phone
to your ear, you trying to joke, and my one good ear failing
me again, so that I couldn’t make out your words, and whispered
goodbye, as now I wait to laugh with you across that great divide."
Noon,"The noon, a mystic dog with paws of fire,
Runs through the sky in ecstasy of drouth,
Licking the earth with tongue of golden flame
Set in a burning mouth.
It floods the forest with loud barks of light,
And chases its own shadow on the plains . . .
Its Master silently hath set it free
Awhile from silver chains.
At last, towards the cinctured end of day,
It drinks cool draughts from sunset-mellowed rills . . .
Then, chained to twilight by the Master’s hand,
It sleeps among the hills."
Gitanjali 64,"On the slope of the desolate river among tall grasses I asked her, “Maiden, where do you go shading your lamp with your mantle? My house is all dark and lonesome lend me your light!” She raised her dark eyes for a moment and looked at my face through the dusk.
    “I have come to the river,” she said, “to float my lamp on the stream when the daylight wanes in the west.” I stood alone among tall grasses and watched the timid flame of her lamp uselessly drifting in the tide.
    In the silence of gathering night I asked her, “Maiden, your lights are all lit—then where do you go with your lamp? My house is all dark and lonesome,—lend me your light.” She raised her dark eyes on my face and stood for a moment doubtful. “I have come,” she said at last, “to dedicate my lamp to the sky.” I stood and watched her light uselessly burning in the void.
    In the moonless gloom of midnight I asked her, “Maiden, what is your quest holding the lamp near your heart? My house is all dark and lonesome,—lend me your light.” She stopped for a minute and thought and gazed at my face in the dark. “I have brought my light,” she said, “to join the carnival of lamps.” I stood and watched her little lamp uselessly lost among lights."
Gitanjali 63,"Thou hast made me known to friends whom I knew not. Thou hast given me seats in homes not my own. Thou hast brought the distant near and made a brother of the stranger.
    I am uneasy at heart when I have to leave my accustomed shelter; I forget that there abides the old in the new, and that there also thou abidest.
    Through birth and death, in this world or in others, wherever thou leadest me it is thou, the same, the one companion of my endless life who ever linkest my heart with bonds of joy to the unfamiliar.
    When one knows thee, then alien there is none, then no door is shut. Oh, grant me my prayer that I may never lose the bliss of the touch of the one in the play of the many."
Gitanjali 62,"When I bring to you coloured toys, my child, I understand why there is such a play of colours on clouds, on water, and why flowers are painted in tints—when I give coloured toys to you, my child. 
   When I sing to make you dance I truly know why there is music in leaves, and why waves send their chorus of voices to the heart of the listening earth—when I sing to make you dance. 
   When I bring sweet things to your greedy hands I know why there is honey in the cup of the flower and why fruits are secretly filled with sweet juice—when I bring sweet things to your greedy hands. 
   When I kiss your face to make you smile, my darling, I surely understand what the pleasure is that streams from the sky in morning light, and what delight that is why the summer breeze brings to my body—when I kiss you to make you smile. "
Gitanjali 61,"The sleep that flits on baby’s eyes—does anybody know from where it comes? Yes, there is a rumour that it has its dwelling where, in the fairy village among shadows of the forest dimly lit with glow-worms, there hang two timid buds of enchantment. From there it comes to kiss baby’s eyes. 
   The smile that flickers on baby’s lips when he sleeps—does anybody know where it was born? Yes, there is a rumour that a young pale beam of a crescent moon touched the edge of a vanishing autumn cloud, and there the smile was first born in the dream of a dew-washed morning—the smile that flickers on baby’s lips when he sleeps. 
   The sweet, soft freshness that blooms on baby’s limbs—does anybody know where it was hidden so long? Yes, when the mother was a young girl it lay pervading her heart in tender and silent mystery of love—the sweet, soft freshness that has bloomed on baby’s limbs. "
Gitanjali 54,"I asked nothing from thee; I uttered not my name to thine ear. When thou took’s thy leave I stood silent. I was alone by the well where the shadow of the tree fell aslant, and the women had gone home with their brown earthen pitchers full to the brim. They called me and shouted, “Come with us, the morning is wearing on to noon.” But I languidly lingered awhile lost in the midst of vague musings. 
   I heart not thy steps as thou camest. Thine eyes were sad when they fell on me; thy voice was tired as thou spokest low—“Ah, I am a thirsty traveller.” I started up from my daydreams and poured water from my jar on thy joined palms. The leaves rustled overhead; the cuckoo sang from the unseen dark, and perfume of babla flowers came from the bend of the road. 
   I stood speechless with shame when my name thou didst ask. Indeed, what had I done for thee to keep me in remembrance? But the memory that I could give water to thee to allay thy thirst will cling to my heart and enfold it in sweetness. The morning hour is late, the bird sings in weary notes, neem leaves rustle overhead and I sit and think and think. "
Gitanjali 52,"I thought I should ask of thee—but I dared not—the rose wreath thou hadst on thy neck. Thus I waited for the morning, when thou didst depart, to find a few fragments on the bed. And like a beggar I searched in the dawn only for a stray petal or two. 
   Ah me, what is it I find? What token left of thy love? It is no flower, no spices, no vase of perfumed water. It is the thy mighty sword, flashing as a flame, heavy as a bolt of thunder. The young light  of morning comes through the window and spreads itself upon thy bed. The morning bird twitters and asks, “Woman, what hast thou got?” No, it is no flower, nor spices, nor vase of perfumed water—it is thy dreadful sword. 
  I sit and muse in wonder, what gift is this of thine. I can find no place where to hide it. I am ashamed to wear it, frail as I am, and it hurts me when I press it to my bosom. Yet shall I bear in my heart this honour of the burden of pain, this gift of thine. 
   From now there shall be no fear left for me in this world, and thou shalt be victorious in all my strife. Thou hast left death for my companion and I shall crown him with my life. Thy sword is with me to cut asunder my bonds, and there shall be no fear left for me in the world. 
   From now I leave off all petty decorations. Lord of my heart, no more shall there be for me waiting and weeping in corners, no more coyness and sweetness of demeanour. Thou hast given me thy sword for adornment. No more doll’s decorations for me! "
Gitanjali 51,"The night darkened. Our day’s works had been done. We thought that the last guest had arrived for the night and the doors in the village were all shut. Only some said, The king was to come. We laughed and said “No, it cannot be!”
    It seemed there were knocks at the door and we said it was nothing but the wind. We put out the lamps and lay down to sleep. Only some said, “It is the messenger!” We laughed and said “No, it must be the wind!”
    There came a sound in the dead of the night. We sleepily thought it was the distant thunder. The earth shook, the walls rocked and it troubled us in our sleep. Only some said, it was the sound of wheels. We said in a drowsy murmur, “No, it must be the rumbling of clouds!”
   The night was still dark when the drum sounded. The voice came “Wake up! delay not!” We pressed our hands on our hearts and shuddered with fear. Some said, “Lo, there is the king’s flag!” We stood up on our feet and cried “There is no time for delay!”
    The king has come—but where are lights, where are wreaths? Where is the throne to seat him? Oh, shame! Oh utter shame! Where is the hall, the decorations? Some one has said, “Vain is this cry! Greet him with empty hands, lead him into thy rooms all bare!”
    Open the doors, let the conch-shells be sounded! In the depth of the night has come the king of our dark, dreary house. The thunder roars in the sky. The darkness shudders with lightning. Bring out thy tattered piece of mat and spread it in the courtyard. With the storm has come of a sudden our king of the fearful night. "
Basanta Panchami,"translated from the Bengali by Lilian M. Whitehouse
To-day, after a year, on the sacred fifth day, Nature has flung away her worn raiment, and with new jewels, see, with fresh buds and new shoots she has begemmed herself and smiles. The birds wing their way, singing with joy; ah, how lovely! The black bee hums as if with sound of “Ulu! ulu!” he wished good fortune to Nature. The south breeze seems to say as it flits from house to house, “To-day Bīnāpāni comes here to Bengal.” Arrayed in guise that would enrapture even sages, maid Nature has come to worship thy feet, O propitious one! See, O India, at this time all pay no heed to fear of plague, famine, earthquake; all put away pain and grief and gloom; to-day all are drunk with pleasure. For a year Nature was waiting in hope for this day to come. Many folk in many a fashion now summon thee, O white-armed one; I also have a mind to worship. Thy two feet are red lotuses; but, say, with what gift shall we worship thee, O mother Bināpāni? Ever sorrowful, ever ill-starred are we women of Bengal, all of us. Yet if thou have mercy, this utterly dependent one will worship thee with the gift of a single tear of devotion shed on thy lotus feet. Graciously accept that, and in mercy, O white-armed one, grant this blessing on my head on this propitious, sacred day, that this life may be spent in thy worship, Mother."

the pocked metronome of tennis balls outside

Astonish us, Diaghilev said to Cocteau, 
but all I ever wanted was to consider,
its roots in the auguries of our shifting stars."
Three Months Since,"My father’s last breath is still the blade 
that pares and cleaves me open. 
From the wound I cradle every beautiful thing:  
my friends’ laughter havocking the moonless night
cricket song spilling from an unfinished building.
In my hands the pastel rind of a grapefruit
plucked from the neighbor’s tree 
sour blush of its fruit plush beneath my nail’s parting. 
How to live knowing all of this will one day join him in the dirt 
and he will never see me beneath palm and palo verde:
my fingers long and lithe as his 
ripping pith from fruit. 
I slurp the good and bitter juice, 
drinking enough for both of us. 
Each night I’ll tell him what he’s missed: 
The tree’s golden litter of leaves 
the mourning doves’ daily song 
rung from branches thrust against the winter sky
too blue and too bright to bear."
Mo Mhíle Stór,"translated from the Irish by Seamus Heaney
I was under your spell from the start:
I was young, I was soft,
and you well knew you could turn my head
with your talk about whitewashed courts
and big long sleeps on a duck-down bed
and gloves made out of the skins of fish.
When you sailed away
my goodbyes were the gulls in your wake.
I put up with rows and with blame
from every side; there was a time
when I could number my friends
on the fingers of one hand.
You sailed through life, you came back home,
your boat beached on my bed.
As I covered you all in honey,
I saw your hair had gone grey
and straight;
but in my memory the curls grew on,
twelve coils in the ripening
crop on your head."
Miraculous Grass,"translated from the Irish by Seamus Heaney
There you were in your purple vestments
half-way through the Mass, an ordained priest
under your linen alb and chasuble and stole:
and when you saw my face in the crowd
for Holy Communion
the consecrated host fell from your fingers.
I felt shame, I never
mentioned it once,
my lips were sealed.
But still it lurked in my heart
like a thorn under mud, and it
worked itself in so deep and sheer
it nearly killed me.
Next thing then, I was laid up in bed.
Consultants came in their hundreds,
doctors and brothers and priests,
but I baffled them all: I was
incurable, they left me for dead.
So out you go, men,
out with the spades and the scythes,
the hooks and shovels and hoes.
Tackle the rubble,
cut back the bushes, clear off the rubbish,
the sappy growth, the whole straggle and mess
that infests my green unfortunate field.
And there where the sacred wafer fell
you will discover
in the middle of the shooting weeds
a clump of miraculous grass.
The priest will have to come then
with his delicate fingers, and lift the host
And bring it to me and put it on my tongue.
Where it will melt, and I will rise in the bed
as fit and well as the youngster I used to be."
Proper names,"  translated from Romanian by Seamus Heaney
When the ancient world foundered
Bottles had not been invented
So whatever was valuable there
Was rolled up
Into a few proper names
And set afloat on the water.
They have reached us safely, those names.
And when we uncork one,
Homer, say, or Pythagoras or Tacitus,
Great sheaves of light break open in the sky,
Millennial chaff falls on our shoulders.
Let us do all we can to increase
The store of proper names in the world
So that if the earth goes down
They will keep on floating,
Trojan horses with the whole of mankind in their bellies,
Headed for the gates of other planets."
Old people in the shade,"  translated from Romanian by Seamus Heaney
You get tired quickly, you forget easily,
You start talking to yourself,
You move your lips
And come on yourself in the mirror moving your lips.
I have a fair notion of how old age will be for me.
For a day or two every summer, for a week
I am old.
Wrinkled, shrunk like a peach stone
In the kernel of the luscious day.
A Ulysses who keeps drifting off,
Forgetting where he’s going back to,
Why he’s astray on the sea,
Whether the war in Troy is over or coming.
A Ulysses unlikely to kiss smoke from the chimneys
Of home.
Are you straightening your tie there
Or strangling yourself?
40 degrees in the sun. I go into the house
And, with an ultimate effort of memory, remember
My name.
Torrid weather is much the same as old age.
The same sensations.
You trip the rugs
You stumble over the slippers –
One of your nails has turned septic,
One of your teeth seems to be looser.
In the summer, we all come together.
We are all old,
Even the foetus in its mother’s womb."
Angle,"  translated from Romanian by Seamus Heaney
Overhead, the traditional lines
Of cranes:
Sonnets for countrymen."
My Life Closed Twice,"Liz, I think her name was, the woman 
my mother brought me to. We played
cards in her perfumed office: lavender,
tulips, bowl of wax fruit. I was ten
and wanted to die. I don’t know why
I’m here again. I lived. Obviously, 
I lived. When I was older, but still 
a child, not innocent, but foolish,
I looked up from my solitary 
suffering. I learned the history
of men. I pointed to a spot
on the map they rendered. I said 
then, then, built my common life
in a room at the end. 
If it’s true, what they say, that poetry 
is written with the knowledge of
and against death, that it is 
a beacon, a bulwark, then Love, 
I confess, I have been no poet. 
Outside, a hawk circles overhead. 
Four cops circle a woman
dressed all in red. I circle
the apartment as you sleep, happily
in the next room. Just this once
I want so desperately 
to be proven wrong. "
Amsterdam,"after Jenny Xie
Concentric ripple of the canals, little apartment 
at the center point. All June I’ve been in Amsterdam, 
vowels softening to liquid in my mouth. Long walks 
over the cobblestones in the warmest part 
of the afternoon, narrow houses along the water arranged 
like crooked teeth. My steps lead me over a ballet 
of bridges, precarious choreography of bicycles 
and other bodies, the rare car vulgar and roaring 
along the too-small street. I count the faces around 
that could be my faces, features and shades 
from a much older world than this. City I may never 
see again, and still my old need to belong. To daughter
the possibly Sudanese man at the Chipsy King, 
his kind assurance that the dish contains no pork. 
My nails soften and split in the cool dry air. An ashen 
gray patch on my calf and I am ashamed for hours after, 
wetting a finger with saliva to correct it."
Gitanjali 49,"You came down from your throne and stood at my cottage door.
I was singing all alone in a corner, and the melody caught your ear. you came down and stood at my cottage door.
Masters are many in your hall, and songs are sung there at all hours. But the simple carol of this novice struck at your love. One plaintive little strain mingled with the great music of the world, and with a flower for a prize you came down and stopped at my cottage door."
Gitanjali 48,"The morning sea of silence broke into ripples of bird songs; and the flowers were all merry by the roadside; and the wealth of gold was scattered through the rift of the clouds while we busily went on our way and paid no heed.
We sang no glad songs nor played; we went not to the village for barter; we spoke not a word nor smiled; we lingered not on the way. We quickened our pace more and more as the time sped by.
The sun rose to the mid sky and doves cooed in the shade. Withered leaves danced and whirled in the hot air of noon. The shepherd boy drowsed and dreamed in the shadow of the banyan tree, and I laid myself down by the water and stretched my tired limbs on the grass.
My companions laughed at me in scorn; they held their heads high and hurried on; they never looked back nor rested; they vanished in the distant blue haze. They crossed many meadows and hills, and passed through strange, far-away countries. All honour to you, heroic host of the interminable path! Mockery and reproach pricked me to rise, but found no response in me. I gave myself up for lost in the depth of a glad humiliation—in the shadow of a dim delight.
The repose of the sun-embroidered green gloom slowly spread over my heart. I forgot for what I had travelled, and I surrendered my mind without struggle to the maze of shadows and songs.
At last, when I woke from my slumber and opened my eyes, I saw thee standing by me, flooding my sleep with thy smile. How I had feared that the path was long and wearisome, and the struggle to reach thee was hard!"
Gitanjali 47,"The night is nearly spent waiting for him in vain. I fear lest in the morning he suddenly come to my door when I have fallen asleep wearied out. Oh friends, leave the way open to him—forbid him not.
If the sound of his steps does not wake me, do not try to rouse me, I pray. I wish not to be called from my sleep by the clamorous choir of birds, by the riot of wind at the festival of morning light. Let me sleep undisturbed even if my lord comes of a sudden to my door.
Ah, my sleep, precious sleep, which only waits for his touch to vanish. Ah, my closed eyes that would open their lids to the light of his smile when he stands before me like a dream emerging from darkness of sleep.
Let him appear before my sight as the first of all lights and all forms. The first thrill of joy to my awakened soul let it come from his glance. And let my return to myself be immediate return to him."
Gitanjali 46,"I know not from what distant time thou art ever coming nearer to meet me. Thy sun and stars can never keep thee hidden from me for aye.
In many a morning and eve thy footsteps have been heard and thy messenger has come within my heart and called me in secret.
I know not why to-day my life is all astir, and a feeling of tremulous joy is passing through my heart.
It is as if the time were come to wind up my work and I feel in the air a faint smell of thy sweet presence."
Gitanjali 45,"Have you not heard his silent steps?
He comes, comes, ever comes.
Every moment and every age, every day and every night he comes, comes, ever comes.
Many a song have I sung in many a mood of mind, but all their notes have always proclaimed, “He comes, comes, ever comes.”
In the fragrant days of sunny April through the forest path he comes, comes, ever comes.
In the rainy gloom of July nights on the thundering chariot of clouds he comes, comes, ever comes.
In sorrow after sorrow it is his steps that press upon my heart, and it is the golden touch of his feet that makes my joy to shine."
Gitanjali 44,"This is my delight, thus to wait and watch at the wayside where shadow chases light and the rain comes in the wake of the summer.
Messengers, with tidings from unknown skies, greet me and speed along the road. My heart is glad within, and the breath of the passing breeze is sweet.
From dawn till dusk I sit here before my door, and I know that of a sudden the happy moment will arrive when I shall see.
In the meanwhile I smile and I sing all alone. In the meanwhile the air is filling with the perfume of promise."
Prologue: Northeaster at Prout’s Neck,"The primordial tensions of those natural forces.
Watch, as the massive waves surge forward, then back
out into the vast Atlantic, as if sucked into some blueblack
vortex, even as another wave and then another comes
crashing in to smash against the jagged granite shore.
The silver glitter spume explodes just feet away, as old
and now instant as that Whirlwind confronting Job.
How is it Homer caught the drama in his Northeaster,
just yards from that ructive cabin there on Prout’s
Neck along the coast of Maine back then? And now
the painting glowers in the cloisterlike environs
of the New York Met, replete with a sleepy guard.
Homer caught it all. Schoolkids playing crack
the whip in those fields outside some one-room
schoolhouse. Those three Confederate prisoners
surrendering at Petersburg, to be interrogated by
a Union officer, one a hillbilly kid, another an old
man lost, and that young rebel officer, hand on hip,
his steady sullen staring in defiance even now.
Then, later, those Southern whites and blacks
in those unforgiving years of Reconstruction, that white
mistress standing awkwardly by the door, not knowing what
to say to her former slaves, nor they to her. Or those English
working classes, the Bermuda natives among the sands
and palmettos, the dangers of the sea, the drifting boat
with a lone black man as sharks circle him
with a typhoon rising in the distance. And in time
even people disappear from his canvasses, and it’s
the sea alone the painter dwells on as at Creation’s start.
As with the poet who must face the blank canvas
of the page and stare and stare and stare again.
And then, if he is blessed (or cursed) a word
at last comes uttering forth. And then another
and another. And then a line, a force, a tension
felt between a gray, a cobalt blue, a green, a dash
of red, an orange dot and a smear of white to say
this is a painting. And then another swirl of white
as three waves spill, and then that giant wave
exploding, again, again, again, as the thing itself,
the real, comes crashing finally down on you."
In Old Age the Poet Seeks the Ancient Wisdom of Lear,"And where, pray tell, will you go to from here?
You with those maps that “make it all clear”?
Where in God’s name are you heading from here?
Wipe those fogged glasses, old man, as you stare
into the void and say what you see over there.
What staticky words are you thinking you hear?  
And what’s spinning about in that brain, you old seer?
What thoughts, if any, are drooling in there?
And what’s that you’re feeling? Something called fear?
Pray, tell us your plans to get there from here?
 
Is that you trying to claw your way over to there?
Now, peer into this cracked crystal ball and stare.
Stare just a bitter longer. into that blank glaze and share
with us all how the shards you’re seeing could ever cohere,
when you don’t have a clue how you even got here."
Hornets’ Nest,"“I really feel I can touch you even in this darkness when I pray.”
James Foley (1973–2014) from his last message to his family
Recovered now enough to scrub the deck,
which has turned dun brown with dirt
and cobwebs in the months I twisted, hurt-
ing in one more hospital bed, my spine a wreck,
my sick brain awash in static bubbles
instead of what I told myself were my tough,
astringent thoughts. Oh, Lord, the troubles
I’ve seen. Well, get over that self-pity stuff.
Your sweet wife has a job for you to do,
so do it. Soap & water (warm works best),
a sponge, & a steady stream of water too,
and voila! Progress. Until you spray a hidden nest
of hornets, who come after you, each a fighter plane
zigging this way, then that, to catch you by surprise
as first your left wrist, then your right, erupt in pain.
And now they’ve found your face, and now your eyes,
and you make what the books call a hasty retreat.
But dammit this is your porch, your house, your home,
and if these S.O.B.s had just remained discreet
or—better—stayed hidden in their aerodrome
you might have done the “live let live.” But no! Not now.
This is war, and one or the other will have to go.
And so it’s two cans of mustard gas. And POW!
Right in the kisser, as Gleason used to say. Hello!
And so I’m back again, ready for a fight, and I keep
hitting them with all I’ve got. But they too hit back
with all they have. And the sad truth is they have deep
reserves, as one winged fiend multiplies by twenty, Jack.
And soon you’re like Cuchulain swinging at the sea
as wave on wave keeps coming on. And you know that in the end
you cannot win, though you win this day. Lord, be
there when they swarm above me. Be there, then, my friend."
High Tea with Miss Julianna,"“Begin at the beginning,” the King said gravely,
“and go on till you come to the end: then stop.”
In the land of the JubJub together they had tea.
High tea, one has to understand, six cups of imaginary
tea, the good Miss Julianna Frances, aged two
and a half, and her grandfather, sixty-four. “How do
you do this afternoon, Miss Julianna,” he began,
good manners there in JubJub Land
being understood and de rigueur between
the Professor and his finical little Queen.
Sporting diapers beneath her summer dress,
she poured her airy tea in cups with such finesse
they might’ve been in Queen Victoria’s drawing room
instead of in his modest parlor. “Might I presume
upon you, my lady dear, for yet another piece of cake?”
“Oh, sure,” she too demurely said. “But let me bake
it first. It will only take one minute.” I.e., one minute
in her understanding, for they had time within it
for another cup or two or four or six or three
of Miss Julianna’s very best imaginary tea,
and time for her to sit upon his lap so he might read her
all about the Midnight Land of JubJub and then confer
together about the best way to pick the naughty dirts
from between their toes, or which of her many skirts
her dolly, coincidentally named for Daddy John,
should wear, and which chair he should sit upon
if Daddy John were to be invited to partake
of tea with them, together with a second piece of cake,
which was humming along just fine in the imaginary
oven in the slowly darkening room. High tea
on a Sunday afternoon at summer’s end,
sweet credences of summer. How better to spend
an hour, a day, a year? And Alice leading down
the rabbit hole, and him following into JubJub town,
and all cares left behind now, as the little girl—who would
not be little long—beckoned towards the still-enchanted wood."
First Light Last,"“You arrive at enough certainty to be able to make your way, but it is making it in darkness. Don’t expect faith to clear things up for you. It is trust, not certainty.”
Flannery O’Connor
  And did you really think there would ever come a time
when things would go as you’d dreamed they should?
That you—you!—could hold the reins of some phaeton-
fated Seven Thirty Seven as it whinnied and shrugged off
what you ordered it to do? You, poor forked thing, you
cursing as the plane bucked then nosedived down,
down and down into the unforgiving earth below?
Late January, Covid-killing time, and six below.
Sing it, pilgrim! Sputter the words out loud!
You’re in the bughouse now. Oh, yeah!
You’re in the bughouse now.
Remember that time, thirty years back, in those sea-
fungus-riddled pitchblack tunnel mazes of Fort Adams?
How a woman tripped and fell just behind you
and you turned to help her up again, even as the guide
and the others kept moving on, your wife among them,  
as she slid into the dark and disappeared, like some Eurydice?
Remember (ha!) the blank fear you felt as you moved
forward, leading the others nowhere, first turning right
then left, as you called out and the chambers echoed
the muffled sounds behind you and it hit you that you might
just be leading you and the others into a makeshift hell,
an underworld, where the lost enter, and then forever dwell.
                                                                                     
Sing it, then, Homer, Hezekiah, Virgil. Sing!
Sing the desolation of those words.
You’re in the bughouse now.
Oh yeah, sick seer, sad soul,
You’re in the bughouse now.
Remember how you glimpsed that faint light
up ahead, then slowly groped your way down
the tunnel toward it, only to come up against that
small grilled window, that ignis fatuus, that dead end
that seemed to hold out hope, before it laughed
and mocked you? You, blind leader of the blind?  
And then, in that darkness, in that mocking hell
hole of a maze, as the groans and curses began to swell
again, a distant light flickered as our guide appeared
and we followed her, this way then that, until we reappeared
once more, thank God, into the dizzle-dazzling bluebell
light, as the others, my Eurydice among them, cheered.
Sing it! Sing the sacred saving words,
again and then again and then again.
De profundis clamavi ad te Domine....
Out of the depths I cry to thee, O Lord,
Pray for us now and at the hour of our death.
Sing them from first light on into nightfall,
until the blessed dawn leads us home again."
De Profundis,"And the Spirit of God was hovering over the face of the waters.
A blank slate, an empty canvas, that sheet
of foolscap eight and a half by eleven long
Bob Creeley—late minimalist,
hip puritan, wiping at his one good
eye—told me once was how a poem began.
Began, because there was no other choice.
And young James Franco, telling me how
he’d tried to recreate what Hart Crane
had done by staring at his own blank page
there on that Olivetti. He was recalling
something Ed Harris had once said:
how he wished he’d kept those two
minutes in the film he was making, where
Jackson Pollock stares unblinking into
the white canvas at the nothing that is there,
not unlike the Creator God who once stared
into the darkness covering the face, if face
it was, given the way the language works—
or doesn’t—that seems to call us from those depths.
That is, until the Spirit, the Arch Breath,
call it the Wind if you will, whipped over
those waters, as over some blank black canvas.
And, in time (if there was time back then)
God said, Let there be light. And like that,
like a switch turning on, there wás light,
and the Lord saw it and called it good. And
where nothing was (if non-being can be said
to be) the trumpet sound of sound itself
began to sound. And it was good. And words
followed: the multifoliate pulse of Pythagorean
sound. Music is its name, what the ancients,
who seemed to know knew better than
we know (if we know anything at all)
called the Music of the Spheres. Then
lines. Lines of verse. Lines of paint as now
Pollock’s brush begins to swerve down
and then across the canvas. And it was good.
Oh, it was very good, for as Issho says,
we must learn to live as waves, each of us unique,
but part, always part, of the ocean from which
we came and to which we must return:
a face of water that stares into a face of water
across which the Wind must always wave its way.
And then it’s back once more to that blank slate
that began these lines: the empty canvas
which seems to taunt the one who dares
to stare upon its face until you catch it staring
unblinking back into the blank face of the beholder."
[A frail hepatica],"A frail hepatica
Shyly holds its fragrance
Beneath the fresh morning dew.
So, Elizabeth."
Gitanjali 59,"Yes, I know, this is nothing but thy love, O beloved of my heart—this golden light that dances upon the leaves, these idle clouds sailing across the sky, this passing breeze leaving its coolness upon my forehead. 
   The morning light has flooded my eyes—this is thy message to my heart. Thy face is bent from above, thy eyes look down on my eyes, and my heart has touched thy feet. "
Gitanjali 58,"Let all the strains of joy mingle in my last song—the joy that makes the earth flow over in the riotous excess of the grass, the joy that sets the twin brothers, life and death, dancing over the wide world, the joy that sweeps in with the tempest, shaking and waking all life with laughter, the joy that sits still with its tears on the open red lotus of pain, and the joy that throws everything it has upon the dust, and knows not a word. "
Gitanjali 57,"Light, my light, the world-filling light, the eye-kissing light, heart sweetening light! 
  Ah, the light dances, my darling, at the centre of my life; the light strikes, my darling, the chords of my love; the sky opens, the wind runs wild, laughter passes over the earth. 
  The butterflies spread their sails on the sea of light. Lilies and jasmines surge up on the crest of the waves of light. 
   The light is shattered into gold on every cloud, my darling, and it scatters gems in profusion. 
   Mirth spreads from leaf to leaf, my darling, and gladness without measure. 
The heaven’s river has drowned its banks and the flood of joy is abroad. "
Gitanjali 56,"Thus it is that thy joy in me is so full. Thus it is that thou hast come down to me. O thou lord of all heavens, where would be thy love if I were not? 
   Thou hast taken me as thy partner of all this wealth. In my heart is the endless play of thy delight. In my life thy will is ever taking shape. 
   And for this, thou who art the King of kings hast decked thyself in beauty to captivate my heart. And for this thy love loses itself in the love of thy lover, and there are art thou seen in the perfect union of two. "
Gitanjali 55,"Languor is upon your heart and the slumber is still on your eyes. 
   Has not the word come to you that the flower is reigning in splendour among thorns? Wake, oh awaken! Let not the time pass in vain! 
   At the end of the stony path, in the country of virgin solitude my friend is sitting all alone. Deceive him not. Wake, oh awaken! 
   What if the sky pants and trembles with the heat of the midday sun—what if burning sand spreads its mantle of thirst—
   Is there no joy in the deep of your heart? At every footfall of yours, will not the harp of the road break out in sweet music of pain? "
Gitanjali 53,"Beautiful is thy wristlet, decked with stars and cunningly wrought in myriad-coloured jewels. But more beautiful to me thy sword with its curve of lightning like the outspread wings of the divine bird of Vishnu, perfectly poised in the angry red light of the sunset. 
   It quivers like the one last response of life in ecstasy of pain at the final stroke of death; it shines like the pure flame of being burning up earthly sense with one fierce flash. 
   Beautiful is thy wristlet, decked with starry gems; but thy sword, O lord of thunder, is wrought with uttermost beauty, terrible to behold or to think of. "
Gitanjali 50,"I had gone a-begging from door to door in the village path, when thy golden chariot appeared in the distance like a gorgeous dream and I wondered who was this King of all kings! 
    My hopes rose high and methought my evil days were at an end, and I stood waiting for alms to be given unasked and for wealth scattered on all sides in the dust. 
   The chariot stopped where I stood. Thy glance fell on me and thou camest down with a smile. I felt that the luck of my life had come at last. Then of a sudden thou didst hold out thy right hand and say “What hast thou to give to me?”
    Ah, what a kingly jest was it to open thy palm to a beggar to beg! I was confused and stood undecided, and then from my wallet I slowly took out the least grain of corn and gave it to thee. 
   But how great my surprise when at the day’s end I emptied my bag on the floor to find a least little grain of gold among the poor heap. I bitterly wept and wished that I had had the heart to give thee to my all. "
Gitanjali 82,"Time is endless in thy hands, my lord.
There is none to count thy minutes.
    Days and nights pass and ages bloom
and fade like flowers. Thou knowest
how to wait.
    Thy centuries follow each other
perfecting a small wild flower.
    We have no time to lose, and having
no time we must scramble for our
chances. We are too poor to be late.
    And thus it is that time goes by
while I give it to every querulous man
who claims it, and thine altar is empty
of all offerings to the last.
    At the end of the day I hasten in
fear lest thy gate be shut; but I find
that yet there is time."
Gitanjali 81,"On many an idle day have I grieved
over lost time. But it is never lost, my
lord. Thou hast taken every moment
of my life in thine own hands.
     Hidden in the heart of things thou
art nourishing seeds into sprouts, buds
into blossoms, and ripening flowers into
fruitfulness.
     I was tired and sleeping on my idle
bed and imagined all work had ceased.
In the morning I woke up and found
my garden full with wonders of flowers."
Gitanjali 80,"I am like a remnant of a cloud of
autumn uselessly roaming in the sky, O
my sun ever-glorious! Thy touch ha
not yet melted my vapour, making me
one with thy light, and thus I count
months and years separated from thee.
    If this be by wish and if this be thy
play, then take this fleeting emptiness
of mine, paint it with colours, gild it
with gold, float it on the wanton wind
and spread it in varied wonders.
    And again when it shall be thy wish
to end this play at night, I shall melt
and vanish away in the dark, or it may
be in a smile of the white morning, in a
coolness of purity transparent."
Gitanjali 79,"If it is not my portion to meet thee in
this my life then let me ever feel that
I have missed thy sight––let me not
forget for a moment, let me carry the
pangs of this sorrow in my dreams and
in my wakeful hours.
    As my days pass in the crowded
market of this world and my hands
grow full with the daily profits, let me
ever feel that I have gained nothing––
let me not forget for a moment, let me
carry the pangs of this sorrow in my
dreams and in my wakeful hours.
    When I sit by the roadside, tired
and panting, when I spread my bed low
in the dust, let me ever feel that the
long journey is still before me––let me
not forget for a moment, let me carry
the pangs of this sorrow in my dreams
and in my wakeful hours.
    When my rooms have been decked
out and the flutes sound and the laugh-
ter there is loud, let me ever feel that I
have not invited thee to my house––
let me not forget for a moment, let me
carry the pangs of this sorrow in my
dreams and in my wakeful hours."
Gitanjali 78,"When the creation was new and all
the stars shone in their first splendor,
the gods held their assembly in the sky
and sang “Oh, the picture of perfec-
tion! the joy unalloyed!”
   But one cried of a sudden––“It seems
that somewhere there is a break in the
chain of light and one of the stars has
been lost.”
   The golden string of their harp
snapped, their song stopped, and they
cried in dismay––“Yes, that lost star
was the best, she was the glory of all
heavens!”
   From that day the search is un-
ceasing for her, and the cry goes on
from one to the other that in her the
world has lost its one joy!
   Only in the deepest silence of night
the stars smile and whisper among
themselves––“Vain is this seeking!
Unbroken perfection is over all!”"
Gitanjali 77,"I know thee as my God and stand
apart––I do not know thee as my own
and come closer. I know thee as my
father and bow before thy feet––I do
not grasp thy hand as my friend’s.
    I stand not where thou comest down
and ownest thyself as mine, there to
clasp thee to my heart and take thee as
my comrade.
    Thou art the Brother amongst my
brothers, but I heed them not, I divide
not my earnings with them, thus shar-
ing my all with thee.
    In pleasure and in pain I stand not
by the side of men, and thus stand
by thee. I shrink to give up my
life, and thus do not plunge into the
great waters of life."
Gitanjali 76,"Day after day, O lord of my life shall
I stand before thee face to face? With
folded hands, O lord of all worlds, shall
I stand before thee face to face?
    Under thy great sky in solitude and
silence, with humble heart shall I stand
before thee face to face?
    In this laborious world of thine,
tumultuous with toil and with struggle,
among hurrying crowds shall I stand
before thee face to face?
    And when my work shall be done in
this world, O King of kings, alone and
speechless shall I stand before thee
face to face?"
Gitanjali 75,"Thy gifts to us mortals fulfil all our
needs and yet run back to thee un-
diminished.
    The river has its everyday work to
do and hastens through fields and
hamlets; yet its incessant stream winds
towards the washing of thy feet.
    The flower sweetens the air with its
perfume; yet its last service is to offer
itself to thee.
    Thy worship does not impoverish the
world.
    From the words of the poet men take
what meanings please them; yet their
last meaning points to thee."
Gitanjali 74,"The day is no more, the shadow is upon
the earth. It is time that I go to the
stream to fill my pitcher.
    The evening air is eager with the sad
music of the water. Ah, it calls me out
into the dusk. In the lonely lane there
is no passer by, the wind is up, the
ripples are rampant in the river.
    I know not if I shall come back
home. I know not whom I shall
chance to meet. There at the fording
in the little boat the unknown man
plays upon his lute."
Gitanjali 73,"Deliverance is not for me in renuncia-
tion. I feel the embrace of freedom in
a thousand bonds of delight.
    Thou ever pourest for me the fresh
draught of thy wine of various colours
and fragrance, filling this earthen vessel
to the brim.
    My world will light its hundred
different lamps with thy flame and
place them before the altar of thy
temple.
    No, I will never shut the doors of
of my senses. The delights of sight and
hearing and touch will bear thy delight.
    Yes, all my illusions will burn into
illumination of joy, and all my desires
ripen into fruits of love."
Gitanjali 72,"He it is, the innermost one, who
awakens my being with his deep hidden
touches.
    He it is who puts his enchantment
upon these eyes and joyfully plays on
the chords of my heart in varied ca-
dence of pleasure and pain.
    He it is who weaves the web of this
maya in evanescent hues of gold and
silver, blue and green, and lets peep out
through the folds his feet, at whose
touch I forget myself.
    Days come and ages pass, and it is
ever he who moves my heart in many a
name, in many a guise, in many a
rapture of joy and sorrow."
Gitanjali 71,"That I should make much of myself
and turn it on all sides, thus casting
coloured shadows on thy radiance––
such is thy maya.
   Thou settest a barrier in thine own
being and then callest thy severed self
in myriad notes. This thy self-separa-
tion has taken body in me.
   The poignant song is echoed through
all the sky in many-coloured tears and
smiles, alarms and hopes; waves rise up
and sink again, dreams break and form.
In me is thy own defeat of self.
   This screen that thou hast raised is
painted with innumerable figures with
the brush of the night and the day.
Behind it thy seat is woven in wondrous
mysteries of curves, casting away all
barren lines of straightness.
   The great pageant of thee and me
has overspread the sky. With the
tune of thee and me all the air is
vibrant, and all ages pass with the hid-
ing and seeking of thee and me."
Gitanjali 43,"The day was when I did not keep myself in readiness for thee; and entering my heart unbidden even as one of the common crowd, unknown to me, my king, thou didst press the signet of eternity upon many a fleeting moment of my life.
And to-day when by chance I light upon them and see thy signature, I find they have lain scattered in the dust mixed with the memory of joys and sorrows of my trivial days forgotten.
Thou didst not turn in contempt from my childish play among dust, and the steps that I heard in my playroom are the same that are echoing from star to star."
Gitanjali 42,"Early in the day it was whispered that we should sail in a boat, only thou and I, and never a soul in the world would know of this our pilgrimage to no country and to no end.
In that shoreless ocean, at thy silently listening smile my songs would swell in melodies, free as waves, free from all bondage of words.
Is the time not come yet? Are there works still to do? Lo, the evening has come down upon the shore and in the fading light the seabirds come flying to their nests.
Who knows when the chains will be off, and the boat, like the last glimmer of sunset, vanish into the night?"
Gitanjali 41,"Where dost thou stand behind them all, my lover, hiding thyself in the shadows? They push thee and pass thee by on the dusty road, taking thee for naught. I wait here weary hours spreading my offerings for thee, while passers by come and take my flowers, one by one, and my basket is nearly empty.
The morning time is past, and the noon. In the shade of evening my eyes are drowsy with sleep. Men going home glance at me and smile and fill me with shame. I sit like a beggar maid, drawing my skirt over my face, and when they ask me, what it is I want, I drop my eyes and answer them not.
Oh, how, indeed, could I tell them that for thee I wait, and that thou hast promised to come. How could I utter for shame that I keep for my dowry this poverty. Ah, I hug this pride in the secret of my heart.
I sit on the grass and gaze upon the sky and dream of the sudden splendour of thy coming—all the lights ablaze, golden pennons flying over thy car, and they at the roadside standing agape, when they see thee come down from thy seat to raise me from the dust, and set at thy side this ragged beggar girl a-tremble with shame and pride, like a creeper in a summer breeze.
But time glides on and still no sound of the wheels of thy chariot. Many a procession passes by with noise and shouts and glamour of glory. Is it only thou who wouldst stand in the shadow silent behind them all? And only I who would wait and weep and wear out my heart in vain longing?"
Gitanjali 40,"The rain has held back for days and days, my God, in my arid heart. The horizon is fiercely naked—not the thinnest cover of a soft cloud, not the vaguest hint of a distant cool shower.
Send thy angry storm, dark with death, if it is thy wish, and with lashes of lightning startle the sky from end to end.
But call back, my lord, call back this pervading silent heat, still and keen and cruel, burning the heart with dire despair.
Let the cloud of grace bend low from above like the tearful look of the mother on the day of the father’s wrath."
Gitanjali 39,"When the heart is hard and parched up, come upon me with a shower of mercy.
When grace is lost from life, come with a burst of song.
When tumultuous work raises its din on all sides shutting me out from beyond, come to me, my lord of silence, with thy peace and rest.
When my beggarly heart sits crouched, shut up in a corner, break open the door, my king, and come with the ceremony of a king.
When desire blinds the mind with delusion and dust, O thou holy one, thou wakeful, come with thy light and thy thunder."
Gitanjali 70,"Is it beyond thee to be glad with the
gladness of this rhythm? To be tossed
and lost and broken in the whirl of this
fearful joy?
    All things rush on, they stop not,
they look not behind, no power can
hold them back, they rush on.
    Keeping steps with that restless, rapid
music, seasons come dancing and pass
away––colours, tunes, and perfumes
pour in endless cascades in the abound-
ing joy that scatters and gives up and
dies every moment."
Gitanjali 69,"The same stream of life that runs
through my veins night and day runs
through the world and dances in
rhythmic measures.
    It is the same life that shoots in joy
through the dust of the earth in
numberless blades of grass and breaks
into tumultuous waves of leaves and
flowers.
    It is the same life that is rocked in
the ocean-cradle of birth and of death,
in ebb and in flow.
    I feel my limbs are made glorious by
the touch of this world of life. And my
pride is from the life-throb of ages
dancing in my blood this moment."
Gitanjali 38,"That I want thee, only thee—let my heart repeat without end. All desires that distract me, day and night, are false and empty to the core.
As the night keeps hidden in its gloom the petition for light, even thus in the depth of my unconsciousness rings the cry—I want thee, only thee.
As the storm still seeks its end in peace when it strikes against peace with all its might, even thus my rebellion strikes against thy love and still its cry is—I want thee, only thee."
Gitanjali 68,"Thy sunbeam comes upon this earth of
mine with arms outstretched and strands
at my door the livelong day to carry
back to thy feet clouds made of my
tears and songs.
    With fond delight thou wrappest
about thy starry breast that mantle of
misty cloud, turning it into numberless
shapes and folds and colouring it with
hues everchanging.
    It is so light and so fleeting, tender
and tearful and dark, that is why thou
lovest it, O thou spotless and serene.
And that is why it may cover thy
awful white light with its pathetic
shadows."
Gitanjali 37,"I thought that my voyage had come to its end at the last limit of my power,—that the path before me was closed, that provisions were exhausted and the time come to take shelter in a silent obscurity.
But I find that thy will knows no end in me. And when old words die out on the tongue, new melodies break forth from the heart; and where the old tracks are lost, new country is revealed with its wonders."
Gitanjali 67,"Thou art the sky and thou art the nest
as well.
    O thou beautiful, there in the nest it
is thy love that encloses the soul with
colours and sounds and odours. 
    There comes the morning with the
golden basket in her right hand bearing
the wreath of beauty, silently to crown
the earth.
    And there comes the evening over
the lonely meadows deserted by herds,
through trackless paths, carrying cool
draughts of peace in her golden pitcher
from the western ocean of rest.
    But there, where spreads the infinite
sky for the soul to take her flight in,
reigns the stainless white radiance.
there is no day nor night, nor form nor
colour, and never, never a word."
Gitanjali 36,"This is my prayer to thee, my lord—strike, strike at the root of penury in my heart. Give me the strength lightly to bear my joys and sorrows.
Give me the strength to make my love fruitful in service.
Give me the strength never to disown the poor or bend my knees before insolent might.
Give me the strength to raise my mind high above daily trifles.
And give me the strength to surrender my strength to thy will with love."
Gitanjali 66,"She who ever had remained in the
depth of my being, in the twilight of
gleams and of glimpses; she who never
opened her veils in the morning light,
will be my last gift to thee, my God,
folded in my final song.
    Words have wooed yet failed to win
her; persuasion has stretched to her its
eager arms in vain.
    I have roamed from country to
country keeping her in the core of my
heart, and around her have risen and
fallen the growth and decay of my life.
    Over my thoughts and actions, my
slumbers and dreams, she reigned yet
dwelled alone and apart.
    Many a man knocked at my door
and asked for her and turned away in
despair.
    There was none in the world who
ever saw her face to face, and she
remained in her loneliness waiting for
thy recognition."
Gitanjali 65,"What divine drink wouldst thou have,
my God, from this overflowing cup of
my life?
    My poet, is it thy delight to see thy
creation through my eyes and to stand
as the portals of my ears silently to
listen to thine own eternal harmony?
    Thy world is weaving words in my
mind and thy joy is adding music to
them. Thou givest thyself to me in
love and then feelest thine own entire
sweetest in me."
Gitanjali 23,"Art thou abroad on this stormy night on the journey of love, my friend? The sky groans like one in despair.
I have no sleep to-night. Ever and again I open my door and look out on the darkness, my friend!
I can see nothing before me. I wonder where lies thy path!
By what dim shore of the ink-black river, by what far edge of the frowning forest, through what mazy depth of gloom art thou threading thy course to come to me, my friend?"
Gitanjali 22,"In the deep shadows of the rainy July, with secret steps, thou walkest, silent as night, eluding all watchers.
To-day the morning has closed its eyes, heedless of the insistent calls of the loud east wind, and a thick veil has been drawn over the ever-wakeful blue sky.
The woodlands have hushed their songs, and doors are all shut at every house. Thou art the solitary wayfarer in this deserted street. Oh my only friend, my best beloved, the gates are open in my house—do not pass by like a dream."
Gitanjali 21,"I must launch out my boat. The languid hours pass by on the shore—Alas for me!
The spring has done its flowering and taken leave. And now with the burden of faded futile flowers I wait and linger.
The waves have become clamorous, and upon the bank in the shady lane the yellow leaves flutter and fall.
What emptiness do you gaze upon! Do you not feel a thrill passing through the air with the notes of the far away song floating from the other shore?"
Gitanjali 20,"On the day when the lotus bloomed, alas, my mind was straying, and I knew it not. My basket was empty and the flower remained unheeded.
Only now and again a sadness fell upon me, and I started up from my dream and felt a sweet trace of a strange fragrance in the south wind.
That vague sweetness made my heart ache with longing and it seemed to me that it was the eager breath of the summer seeking for its completion.
I knew not then that it was so near, that it was mine, and that this perfect sweetness had blossomed in the depth of my own heart."
Gitanjali 19,"If thou speakest not I will fill my heart with thy silence and endure it. I will keep still and wait like the night with starry vigil and its head bent low with patience.
The morning will surely come, the darkness will vanish, and thy voice pour down in golden streams breaking through the sky.
Then thy words will take wing in songs from every one of my birds’ nests, and thy melodies will break forth in flowers in all my forest groves."
Gitanjali 18,"Clouds heap upon clouds and it darkens. Ah, love, why dost thou let me wait outside at the door all alone?
In the busy moments of the noontide work I am with the crowd, but on this dark lonely day it is only for thee that I hope.
If thou showest me not thy face, if thou leavest me wholly aside, I know not how I am to pass these long, rainy hours.
I keep gazing on the far away gloom of the sky, and my heart wanders wailing with the restless wind."
Gitanjali 17,"I am only waiting for love to give myself up at last into his hands. That is why it is so late and why I have been guilty of such omissions.
They come with their laws and their codes to bind me fast; but I evade them ever, for I am only waiting for love to give myself up at last into his hands.
People blame me and call me heedless; I doubt not they are right in their blame.
The market day is over and work is all done for the busy. Those who came to call me in vain have gone back in anger. I am only waiting for love to give myself up at last into his hands."
Gitanjali 16,"I have had my invitation to this world’s festival, and thus my life has been blessed. My eyes have seen and my ears have heard.
It was my part at this feast to play upon my instrument, and I have done all I could.
Now, I ask, has the time come at last when I may go in and see thy face and offer thee my silent salutation?"
Gitanjali 7,"My song has put off her adornments. She has no pride of dress and decoration. Ornaments would mar our union; they would come between thee and me; their jingling would drown thy whispers.
My poet’s vanity dies in shame before thy sight. O master poet, I have sat down at thy feet. Only let me make my life simple and straight, like a flute of reed for thee to fill with music."
Gitanjali 6,"Pluck this little flower and take it, delay not! I fear lest it droop and drop into the dust.
It may not find a place in thy garland, but honour it with a touch of pain from thy hand and pluck it. I fear lest the day end before I am aware, and the time of offering go by.
Though its colour be not deep and its smell be faint, use this flower in thy service and pluck it while there is time."
Gitanjali 5,"I ask for a moment’s indulgence to sit by thy side. The works that I have in hand I will finish afterwards.
Away from the sight of thy face my heart knows no rest nor respite, and my work becomes an endless toil in a shoreless sea of toil.
To-day the summer has come at my window with its sighs and murmurs; and the bees are plying their minstrelsy at the court of the flowering grove.
Now it is time to sit quiet, face to face with thee, and to sing dedication of life in this silent and overflowing leisure."
Gitanjali 4,"Life of my life, I shall ever try to keep my body pure, knowing that thy living touch is upon all my limbs.
I shall ever try to keep all untruths out from my thoughts, knowing that thou art that truth which has kindled the light of reason in my mind.
I shall ever try to drive all evils away from my heart and keep my love in flower, knowing that thou hast thy seat in the inmost shrine of my heart.
And it shall be my endeavour to reveal thee in my actions, knowing it is thy power gives me strength to act."
Gitanjali 3,"I know not how thou singest, my master! I ever listen in silent amazement.
The light of thy music illumines the world. The life breath of thy music runs from sky to sky. The holy stream of thy music breaks through all stony obstacles and rushes on.
My heart longs to join in thy song, but vainly struggles for a voice. I would speak, but speech breaks not into song, and I cry out baffled. Ah, thou hast made my heart captive in the endless meshes of thy music, my master!"
Gitanjali 2,"When thou commandest me to sing it seems that my heart would break with pride; and I look to thy face, and tears come to my eyes.
All that is harsh and dissonant in my life melts into one sweet harmony—and my adoration spreads wings like a glad bird on its flight across the sea.
I know thou takest pleasure in my singing. I know that only as a singer I come before thy presence.
I touch by the edge of the far spreading wing of my song thy feet which I could never aspire to reach.
Drunk with the joy of singing I forget myself and call thee friend who art my lord."
Gitanjali 1,"Thou hast made me endless, such is thy pleasure. This frail vessel thou emptiest again and again, and fillest it ever with fresh life.
This little flute of a reed thou hast carried over hills and dales, and hast breathed through it melodies eternally new.
At the immortal touch of thy hands my little heart loses its limits in joy and gives birth to utterance ineffable.
Thy infinite gifts come to me only on these very small hands of mine. Ages pass, and still thou pourest, and still there is room to fill."
Gitanjali 103,"In one salutation to thee, my God, let 
all my senses spread out and touch this 
world at thy feet.
   Like a rain-cloud of July hung low 
with its burden of unshed showers let 
all my mind bend down at thy door in 
one salutation to thee.
   Let all my songs gather together 
their diverse strains into a single current
and flow to a sea of silence in one salu- 
tation to thee.
   Like a flock of homesick cranes flying 
night and day back to their mountain 
nests let all my life take its voyage to 
its eternal home in one salutation to 
thee."
Gitanjali 102,"I boasted among men that I had known
you. They see your pictures in all 
works of mine. They come and ask
me, “Who is he?” I know not how 
to answer them. I say, “Indeed, I 
cannot tell.” They blame me and they 
go away in scorn. And you sit there
smiling.
    I put my tales of you into lasting 
songs. The secret gushes out from my
heart. They come and ask me, “Tell
me all your meanings.” I know not
how to answer them. I say, “Ah, who
knows what they mean!” They smile
and go away in utter scorn. And you
sit there smiling."
Gitanjali 101,"Ever in my life have I sought thee 
with my songs. It was they who led 
me from door to door, and with them 
have I felt about me, searching and
touching my world.
   It was my songs that taught me all
the lessons I ever learnt; they showed
me secret paths, they brought before 
my sight many a star on the horizon of
my heart.
  They guided me all the day long to 
the mysteries of the country of pleasure 
and pain, and, at last, to what palace
gate have they brought me in the 
evening at the end of my journey?"
Gitanjali 100,"I dive down into the depth of the ocean
of forms, hoping to gain the perfect 
pearl of the formless.
    No more sailing from harbour to 
harbour with this my weather-beaten 
boat. The days are long passed when 
my sport was to be tossed on waves.
And now I am eager to die into 
the deathless.
Into the audience hall by the fathom 
less abyss where swells up the music of 
toneless strings I shall take this harp of 
my life.
I shall tune it to the notes of for ever, 
and, when it has sobbed out its last
utterance, lay down my silent harp at 
the feet of the silent."
Gitanjali 99,"When I give up the helm I know that 
the time has come for thee to take it. 
What there is to do will be instantly 
done. Vain is this struggle.
   Then take away your hands and
silently put up with your defeat, my 
heart, and think it your good fortune
to sit perfectly still where you are
placed.
   These my lamps are blown out at
every little puff of wind, and trying to 
light them I forget all else again and 
again.
   But I shall be wise this time and wait
in the dark, spreading my mat on the 
floor; and whenever it is thy pleasure,
my lord, come silently and take thy seat here."
Gitanjali 98,"I will deck thee with trophies, garlands 
of my defeat. It is never in my power
to escape unconquered.
    I surely know my pride will go to the 
wall, my life will burst its bonds in ex-
ceeding pain, and my empty heart will 
sob out in music like a hollow reed, and
the stone will melt in tears.
    I surely know the hundred petals of
a lotus will not remain closed for ever 
and the secret recess of its honey will 
be bared.
    From the blue sky an eye shall gaze
upon me and summon me in silence.
Nothing will be left for me, nothing 
whatever, and utter death shall I receive 
at thy feet."
Gitanjali 97,"When my play was with thee I never 
questioned who thou wert. I knew nor 
shyness nor fear, my life was boisterous.
    In the early morning thou wouldst
call me from my sleep like my own 
comrade and lead me running from
glade to glade.
    On those days I never cared to know
the meaning of songs thou sangest to 
me. Only my voice took up the tunes, 
and my heart danced in their cadence.
    Now, when the playtime is over, 
what is this sudden sight that is come 
upon me? The world with eyes bent 
upon thy feet stands in awe with all its 
silent stars."
Gitanjali 96,"When I go from hence let this be my 
parting word, that what I have seen is
unsurpassable.
   I have tasted of the hidden honey of
this lotus that expands on the ocean of 
light, and thus am I blessed-let this
be my parting word.
   In this playhouse of infinite forms I
have had my play and here have I 
caught sight of him that is formless.
   My whole body and my limbs have 
thrilled with his touch who is beyond 
touch; and if the end comes here, let 
it come-let this be my parting word."
Gitanjali 95,"I was not aware of the moment when
I first crossed the threshold of this life. 
    What was the power that made me 
open out into this vast mystery like a
bud in the forest at midnight!
    When in the morning I looked upon 
the light I felt in a moment that I was 
no stranger in this world, that the in-
scrutable without name and form had 
taken me in its arms in the form of my
own mother.
    Even so, in death the same unknown
will appear as ever known to me. And 
because I love this life, I know I shall 
love death as well.
   The child cries out when from the 
right breast the mother takes it away, 
in the very next moment to find in the 
left one its consolation."
Though from Here I Can’t Smell the Smoke,"In medieval frescoes haloed saints are edged in flame 
when God is around,
melting like a rumor
to the corners of a room,
giving off heat. Tulip-tipped, sky-bright. 
These days, they name fires like saints:
Willow, Glass, Dixie, August, Wolf,
Live Oak, Snow, Point, Camp, Creek. I’m feeling thermal
as my home state burns 
up another set of firsts.
I watch footage on repeat:
embers fly, jump highways, scrape
life from gnarled hillsides. Soot
in the atmosphere. Viewable
from space. I turn
the volume up: interference on the microphone, ash-colored, this pitch
of burning, this tunnel
funneling waves—
The glowing perimeter thrums, widens.
Rim of the world, smoldering.
Where did my edges go?
What holds
head to neck, hand to fingers,
brain to sickness?
I can feel the stitches lift—
The flame stalks, flowers 
up, and eats
now stands of trees, now scrub
and mountain underbrush. The sky
gauzes with smoke
and air
that rustles—spark and sear
of holy cellophane."

Wanting a Child,"Here in California, we can drive through any
landscape, field, flower, forest, all in reach, 
at sunset, affording not to notice the exhaust
left in our stead. A daytrip takes us to the edge
of the continent, leaning out over some precipice,
looking back. We are home by dinner, the house
soft color, where our bodies move through dark’s
thin language and something calls, urgently, from after.
Some days I don’t know if it’s fair of me, built
as I am, a man, unable to carry every inch of an idea
into the future. In Gubbio, each spring brings
the same pageant. Up hills of the medieval town,
up streets obscured by screaming crowds, three teams
of men in bright blouses tumble upward with their tribute.
Up switchbacks, up stone roads smoothed by centuries’ 
tradition. In the middle of May they come this way, to carry
the wooden paraphrase of candles on their sweating,
rainbowed shoulders. Each four meters tall, an emblem
of a patron saint. The same one wins each year. 
All Umbria comes to watch this alias of a race. 
But the exertions are real: the men intent, although 
they know what little their ardor comes to. They pass 
the title on through blood. Each time, the cheers 
subside when they touch the basilica. They set
the good things down. What honor it must be 
to carry something so beyond you up into 
the sky, up toward the face of god. What work 
your faith must take. What flagrancy. "
Dirtbag,"At the funeral, his other former girlfriend gives the eulogy. I sit in the pew.
Sitting in front of me, and behind me, and also to both sides, are more other former girlfriends.
Something heartfelt shared by Ex on the Mic sets off a chorus of sniffles among the Exes in Rows. They tuck their hair behind their little ears.
There are so many different people to hate, so I keep things simple and hate everyone.
I know why he picked me, a novelty.
I wore Mary Janes and high-neck dresses and labeled the shelves “Tuna and Nuts” and “Breakfast Items, Soup.” My hair was always squeaky clean.
Now I am someone entirely new.
A black dog, a broken heart.
I revel in being more like him now.
At home, I put on my sunglasses and turn off the lights.
Sitting on the toilet where light can’t peek through, I pretend the plunger’s a white cane. My chin held too high and to the side, I run through gruesome imitations of anger, contempt, disgust, sadness, surprise.
The world will be unsettled.
I will unsettle them."
In the House With No Doors,"we have given up on knocking. 
Incoming! we say, with our eyes lowered for modesty,
or, Hello! or sometimes, Sorry, sorry! 
You have to pass through everyone’s bedroom
to get to the kitchen. We only have two bathrooms. 
As a courtesy, nobody will poop while you are showering,
but they might have to do their makeup or shave 
if they are in a rush, if we have somewhere to be,
so you can recognize every person by their whistle 
through a wet shower curtain, you haven’t seen your own face
on an unfogged mirror in weeks. It doesn’t matter,
self-consciousness has no currency here. 
If you were nosy, I suppose the little bathroom trashcans 
would spill their secrets to you, but why bother, 
privacy is a language we don’t speak.
Someone is always awake before you, 
the smell of coffee easing you into a today
they have already entered, 
a bridge you will never need to cross first,
and no matter how latenight your owl,
there is always someone still awake 
to eat popcorn with, to whisper your daily report to,
to compare notes on what good news you each caught in your nets.
In bed, you say, Goodnight! in one direction 
and someone says it back, then turns and passes it, 
so you fall asleep to the echo of goodnights down the long hallway
’til it donuts its way back around to your pillow. 
Someone is doing a load of laundry,
if anyone wants to add some extra socks?
Someone is clearing the dishes, 
someone has started singing Gershwin in the backyard 
and you can’t help but harmonize,
and for a moment what you always hoped was true
finally is: loneliness has forgotten your address,
french toast browning on the stovetop,
the sound of everyone you love
clear as the sun giggling through the window,
not even a doorknob between you."
When It Comes Down To It,"Trip the door to stick, 
we with the bag mouths

yawping in the blank
space where our joy

once lived, little blooming 
weed, purple dead nettle 

where have you gone
good flourishing? Red 

feather I found bent 
on the wildflower berm

soaked but not soaked 
simply shadowed still 

unweighted, insistent 
it belongs to flight. "
Poem,"Whenever I feel loss or lack, I imagine 
The wind roaming outside of my childhood’s lair
—as I am a child again, with my red knapsack 
bouncing lightly on my back— 
Beckoning me to run to it, into its slurry white expanse . . .
And in my heart, I am already on my way 
To some thrilling future 
Which is not yet weak and diluted with a lonely pain.
There, I am someone who wishes to be 
An exception and I am. A third and ringing note 
Edges the banal alternatives of 
Yes, and No. A lyric possibility rises 
Everywhere and at once, a thousand roses—allusive, corrosive.
Think how much you must change. Even more than you dare."
The Inland Food Bowl,"A gapped circle of colonies
each staring at the ocean
through a glass plaid of imports.
Inland lies the still uncrowded
heartland once of steamboats and drawl,
now half desert, half freshwater province. 
There the Murray descends its seven thousand
feet off the Pilot, zigzags over the plains,
forest and furrow, towards an outfall wash.
Shallow rivers connect to this one, or slant north
where the dragon Ceratodus grunts in ivory mail
and streets are shaded in peppercorn and willow.
Having monstered tribesfolk,
dressed POWs in maroon,
it now flickers dials, or pipes experienced water
onto rice, onto cotton, on to Adelaide,
Western rivers merge down the Darling
above the flint blade
and reburied bones of the Warrior
as snow wind chills the saltbush
down from seven thousand feet."
It Begins With the Trees,"Two full cypress trees in the clearing
intertwine in a way that almost makes
them seem like one. Until at a certain angle
from the blue blow-up pool I bought
this summer to save my life, I see it
is not one tree, but two, and they are
kissing. They are kissing so tenderly
it feels rude to watch, one hand
on the other’s shoulder, another
in the other’s branches, like hair.
When did kissing become so
dangerous? Or was it always so?
That illicit kiss in the bathroom
of the Four-Faced Liar, a bar
named after a clock, what was her
name? Or the first one with you
on the corner of Metropolitan
Avenue, before you came home
with me forever. I watch those green
trees now and it feels libidinous.
I want them to go on kissing, without
fear. I want to watch them and not
feel so abandoned by hands. Come
home. Everything is begging you."
Drowning Creek,"Past the strip malls and the power plants, 
out of the holler, past Gun Bottom Road
and Brassfield and before Red Lick Creek, 
there’s a stream called Drowning Creek where 
I saw the prettiest bird I’d seen all year, 
the belted kingfisher, crested in its Aegean 
blue plumage, perched not on a high snag
but on a transmission wire, eyeing the creek 
for crayfish, tadpoles, and minnows. We were 
driving fast toward home and already our minds
were pulled taut like a high black wire latched 
to a utility pole. I wanted to stop, stop the car
to take a closer look at the solitary, stocky water
bird with its blue crown and its blue chest
and its uncommonness. But already we were
a blur and miles beyond the flying fisher
by the time I had realized what I’d witnessed. 
People were nothing to that bird, hovering over 
the creek. I was nothing to that bird, which wasn’t 
concerned with history’s bloody battles or why 
this creek was called Drowning Creek, a name 
I love though it gives me shivers, because 
it sounds like an order, a place where one 
goes to drown. The bird doesn’t call it anything. 
I’m almost certain, though I am certain 
of nothing. There is a solitude in this world
I cannot pierce. I would die for it. "
[The ringèd moon sits eerily],"The ringèd moon sits eerily 
Like a mad woman in the sky,
Dropping flat hands to caress
The far world’s shaggy flanks and breast,
Plunging white hands in the glade
Elbow deep in leafy shade
Where birds sleep in each silent brake
Silverly, there to wake
The quivering loud nightingales 
Whose cries like scattered silver sails
Spread across the azure sea.
Her hands also caress me:
My keen heart also does she dare;
While turning always through the skies
Her white feet mirrored in my eyes 
Weave a snare about my brain
Unbreakable by surge or strain,
For the moon is mad, for she is old,
And many’s the bead of a life she’s told;
And many’s the fair one she’s seen wither:
They pass, they pass, and know not whither.
The hushèd earth, so calm, so old,
Dreams beneath its heath and wold—
And heavy scent from thorny hedge 
Paused and snowy on the edge 
Of some dark ravine, from where
Mists as soft and thick as hair
Float silver in the moon.
Stars sweep down—or are they stars?—
Against the pines’ dark etchèd bars.
Along a brooding moon-wet hill
Dogwood shine so cool and still,
Like hands that, palm up, rigid lie
In invocation to the sky
As they spread there, frozen white,
Upon the velvet of the night."

Playing with Bees,"So the world turned
its one good eye
to watch the bees
take most of metaphor
                        with them.
            Swarms—
                        in all their airborne
                    pointillism—
                                shifted on the breeze

for the last time. Of course,
the absence of bees
                                    left behind significant holes
in ecology. Less


                                    obvious
            were the indelible holes
in poems, which would come
                                                            later:

Our vast psychic habitat
shrunk. Nothing was

            like nectar
                                    for the gods

Nobody was warned by
a deep black dahlia, and nobody

grew like a weed.

Nobody felt spry as
                        a daisy, or blue
                        and princely
as a hyacinth; was lucid as
            a moon flower.            Nobody came home


                        and yelled   honey!   up the stairs,

And nothing in particular
by any other name would smell as sweet as—
Consider:
the verbal dearth
that is always a main ripple of extinction.
The lexicon of wilds goes on nixing its descriptions.
Slimming its index of references
for what is

super as a rhubarb, and juicy
as a peach,
or sunken as a
comb and ancient as an alder tree, or
conifer, or beech, what is royal
as jelly, dark as a wintering

hive, toxic as the jessamine vine
who weeps the way a willow does,
silently as wax
burned in the land of milk and

all the strong words in poems,
they were once

smeared on the mandible of a bee."
Ledge,"No use telling 
         the dead what 
you’ve learned since 
they’ve learnt it too— 
how to go on 
         without you, the mercy

         the light that persists 
even if.

Beauty is as beauty

so they write.

It’s like a language,

by living—there—

Salvage,"On the top of Mount Pisgah, on the western
slope of the Mayacamas, there’s a madrone
tree that’s half-burned from the fires, half-alive
from nature’s need to propagate. One side
of her is black ash and at her root is what
looks like a cavity that was hollowed out
by flame. On the other side, silvery green
broadleaf shoots ascend toward the winter
light and her bark is a cross between a bay
horse and a chestnut horse, red and velvety
like the animal’s neck she resembles. I have
been staring at the tree for a long time now.
I am reminded of the righteousness I had
before the scorch of time. I miss who I was.
I miss who we all were, before we were this: half
alive to the brightening sky, half dead already.
I place my hand on the unscarred bark that is cool
and unsullied, and because I cannot apologize
to the tree, to my own self I say, I am sorry.
I am sorry I have been so reckless with your life."
Why I Needed To,"because I faithfully reply to every email from the absurd
gods of urgency who punish my good deeds by leaving me
empty when I empty my inbox … because I praise hating
myself, broken into my calendar’s time-slotted tasks, slicing
me thin with the thick duty of being everything yet nothing
to anyone, not even to me … because I remember birthdays
but forget my own and my mother’s … because she is bitter
sweet as the Cuban coffee she brews after Sunday dinners …
because she loves me only in the language of her cooking
my favorite dish: shrimp enchilados … because of my bland
father sunk in his armchair without me on his lap … because
he never told me the life story I read only in the half
moons of his eyes the morning he gazed into mine, then
died … because my brother and I need to drink to share
our shared hurt at happy hour, so unhappily grateful for
love’s wreckage … because my husband, who’s still scared
of his adoration for me as we embrace sleep, still doubts
how long I’ll nest my dreams in his arms … because I have
never quite told him: always … because I’m just as afraid of
needing him more than myself … because I’m not the one
I’ve curated on Instagram: oh so humbled by, so grateful for,
so many posted blessings with my posed selves … because
tonight I again remember I’m nothing more than a mirage
slowly disappearing on my porch, sitting with half the life
I have left, still trying to piece how I fit into the puzzle of
the constellations … because I’ve drunk their shots of light
and too many martinis … because I’m cheering mindlessly
to the moon, to my wish for immortality amid the clouds
of my own cigarette smoke … because I should finally quit
doubting my life will be more than these anonymous bones
… because I need to believe in something else, truer than
me … that’s why today I had to take myself away
to the beach … because I needed to imagine my father as
that father at the shore, handing a bouquet of seashells to
his son … because I needed to taste that love can be simple
as a mother remembering to pack sodas and sandwiches …
because I needed the seagulls tending the horizon to teach
me again to be as still as them, to peer calmly into the void
of the skies I face … because I needed to hear the waves
break and break me into the lines of this poem … because  
I needed to burn, to see myself shine just as beautifully  
as the rosy glow of the sunlight bathing my closed eyes."
Gitanjali 94,"At this time of my parting, wish me 
good luck, my friends! The sky is 
flushed with the dawn and my path lies 
beautiful.
    Ask not what I have with me to take 
there. I start on my journey with
empty hands and expectant heart.
   I shall put on my wedding garland. 
Mine is not the red-brown dress of the
traveller, and though there are dangers 
on the way I have no fear in my mind. 
   The evening star will come out when
my voyage is done and the plaintive 
notes of the twilight melodies be struck
up from the King's gateway."
Gitanjali 93,"I have got my leave. Bid me farewell, 
my brothers! I bow to you all and
take my departure.
   Here I give back the keys of my
door-and I give up all claims to my 
house. I only ask for last kind words
from you.
    We were neighbours for long, but I
received more than I could give. Now 
the day has dawned and the lamp
that lit my dark corner is out. A 
summons has come and I am ready
for my journey."
Gitanjali 92,"I know that the day will come when 
my sight of this earth shall be lost, and 
life will take its leave in silence, drawing 
the last curtain over my eyes.
   Yet stars will watch at night, and 
morning rise as before, and hours heave
like sea waves casting up pleasures 
and pains.
   When I think of this end of my 
moments, the barrier of the moments 
breaks and I see by the light of death 
thy world with its careless treasures. 
Rare is its lowliest seat, rare is its 
meanest of lives.
   Things that I longed for in vain and
things that I got-let them pass. Let
me but truly possess the things that I 
ever spurned and overlooked."
Gitanjali 91,"O thou the last fulfilment of life, Death,
my death, come and whisper to me!
   Day after day have I kept watch for
thee; for thee have I borne the joys 
and pangs of life.
   All that I am, that I have, that I hope 
and all my love have ever flowed towards 
thee in depth of secrecy. One final 
glance from thine eyes and my life will 
be ever thine own.
   The flowers have been woven and the
garland is ready for the bridegroom. 
After the wedding the bride shall leave
her home and meet her lord alone in the 
solitude of night."
Gitanjali 90,"On the day when death will knock at 
thy door what wilt thou offer to him?
   Oh, I will set before my guest the 
full vessel of my life-I will never let 
him go with empty hands.
   All the sweet vintage of all my 
autumn days and summer nights, all
the earnings and gleanings of my busy 
life will I place before him at the close
of my days when death will knock at 
my door."
Gitanjali 89,"No more noisy, loud words from me-
such is my master's will. Henceforth
I deal in whispers. The speech of my 
heart will be carried on in murmurings
of a song.
   Men hasten to the King's market.
All the buyers and sellers are there. 
But I have my untimely leave in the 
middle of the day, in the thick of work.
   Let then the flowers come out in my 
garden, though it is not their time; 
and let the midday bees strike up their 
lazy hum.
   Full many an hour have I spent in 
the strife of the good and the evil, but
now it is the pleasure of my playmate
of the empty days to draw my heart on 
to him; and I know not why is this 
sudden call to what useless incon-
sequence!"
Gitanjali 88,"Deity of the ruined temple! The
broken strings of Vina sing no more
your praise. The bells in the evening
proclaim not your time of worship. 
The air is still and silent about you.
   In your desolate dwelling comes the
vagrant spring breeze. It brings the 
tidings of flowers-the flowers that for
your worship are offered no more. 
   Your worshipper of old wanders ever 
longing for favour still refused. In the 
eventide, when fires and shadows mingle 
with the gloom of dust, he wearily 
comes back to the ruined temple with
hunger in his heart.
   Many a festival day comes to you
in silence, deity of the ruined temple.
Many a night of worship goes away 
with lamp unlit.
   Many new images are built by 
masters of cunning art and carried to
the holy stream of oblivion when their 
time is come.
   Only the deity of the ruined temple
remains unworshipped in deathless
neglect."
Someone Forgot to Whisper Your Death to the Bees,"Someone forgot to whisper your death to the bees
And so all the bees have left
And the fruit trees have died.
In the house there are twelve ghosts 
And all of them you—
Caught like birds in the stations of girlhood.
One ghost kneels before an empty fireplace;
She sings her sister’s name
Into the cool mouth of the chimney,
Listens as the voice shivers
Its return.
A barefoot ghost pitches stones 
Down the red dirt road.
The melancholy sister at the kitchen window
Waits for a letter, watches for the postman.
Twelve ghosts. Each sister ties
A different color ribbon in her hair.
One sweeps all the rooms of the house.
Two stand before the mirror. But it’s bad luck
For two to look into a mirror at the same time;
The youngest will die.
And what of the one in the basement?
No, we don’t visit her.
Twelve white plates laid on the table for supper.
All twelve drink water from one well.
Each daughter moves in the mood of her own month.
They carry the tides, the seasons, the year of you.
Each daughter, each dancer,
Delivers the message of you.
One dreams she’s a racehorse rider—
She straddles the propane tank in the yard 
And rides recklessly into the night.
One ghost plays a nocturne on the piano,
While another skips into the room,
Strikes the discordant keys, and vanishes.
The last ghost leans with her ear against a dead wasp nest. 
She closes her eyes and listens
To you, still singing 
Beyond the kingdom of the living"

Lullaby,"for Wendell
Algae pushes north 
and further north. 
The plankton follows, 
and with it, a biome
of multifarious
sea creatures: microbes, 
mollusks. Charismatic 
megafauna. All of them
now breed at higher latitude, 
which means the things
that bred at that higher latitude 
now breed elsewhere
and elsewhere
eat. I linger at the end, 
the edge of it. I tread 
the precipice
of the abyss. It is Friday,
early, and my son
is newly born. In the dark
he coos and grunts. The slowing
stream of morning
news murmurs in his ear. 
It cradles him
in a sound, like some
object of history. 
Outside, berry brambles 
glisten in an almost 
absent wind, here
and there starting up
to toss pollen from a node. 
The starlings, always 
starlings, tighten
like fists along a strand
of telephone wire.
My son, he’s sucking
on my finger. He’s looking
up at me with two bulbous 
slate gray eyes that hardly 
let me scrawl these words. 
I think of the beluga
whale stitched on his shirt, the fishy 
taste of the milk it feeds
its own young, born in warmer 
waters, which push them
toward the pole. Here, sun
pummels the windows
and the exposed planks of the house, 
summons tiny seedlings
from the mud. It desiccates 
the herbs left hanging
on the porch. My son 
writhes in my arm, a single
muscle almost, slacking
and contracting as he throws 
another wail. The end, it’s moving 
toward us. His future’s set
in an unreadable script. 
Through glass
I watch starlings shuffle 
and drift, displace
grubworms from the dirt.
My neighbor shaves
a bristlecone pine toppled
in the morning heat. He drops
the limbs in piles
and soaks the wood in flame. 
Somewhere in the distance 
plankton colonies dissolve.
Whales go with them. 
The oak trees
burn in Spain. My son 
rolls his eyes over curtains
and patterned sheets, gazes 
at the azure
light of the TV. At his lips, 
a milky bubble. He moves
his tiny head. He dozes
to the changeless whir
of the machine, gogging, I presume, 
at its slow and secret ministry."
Gitanjali 87,"In desperate hope I go and search for 
her in all the corners of my room; I
find her not.
    My house is small and what once has
gone from it can never be regained.
But infinite is thy mansion, my lord, 
and seeking her I have come to thy 
door.
    I stand under the golden canopy of
thine evening sky and I lift my eager
eyes to thy face.
    I have come to the brink of eternity
from which nothing can vanish-no 
hope, no happiness, no vision of a face 
seen through tears.
    Oh, dip my emptied life into that 
ocean, plunge it into the deepest full- 
ness. Let me for once feel that lost 
sweet touch in the allness of the uni-
verse."
Gitanjali 86,"Death, thy servant, is at my door.
He has crossed the unknown sea and
brought thy call to my home.
   The night is dark and my heart is 
fearful-yet I will take up the lamp,
open my gates and bow to him my 
welcome. It is thy messenger who 
stands at my door.
   I will worship him with folded hands,
and with tears. I will worship him 
placing at his feet the treasure of my 
heart.
   He will go back with his errand done,
leaving a dark shadow on my morning; 
and in my desolate home only my
forlorn self will remain as my last
offering to thee."
Gitanjali 85,"When the warriors came out first from
their master's hall, where had they hid
their power? Where were their 
armour and their arms?
    They looked poor and helpless, and 
the arrows were showered upon them
on the day they came out from their
master's hall.
    When the warriors marched back 
again to their master's hall where did 
they hide their power?
    They had dropped the sword and 
dropped the bow and the arrow ; peace 
was on their foreheads, and they had 
left the fruits of their life behind them
on the day they marched back again to 
their master's hall."
Gift,"This is mint and here are three pinks 
I have brought you, Mother. 
They are wet with rain 
And shining with it. 
The pinks smell like more of them 
In a blue vase: 
The mint smells like summer 
In many gardens."
Gitanjali 84,"It is the pang of separation that spreads 
throughout the world and gives birth
to shapes innumerable in the infinite sky. 
    It is this sorrow of separation that
gazes in silence all night from star to
star and becomes lyric among rustling 
leaves in rainy darkness of July.
    It is this overspreading pain that 
deepens into loves and desires, into
sufferings and joys in human homes;
and this it is that ever melts and flows
in songs through my poet's heart."
City Roofs 1932,"A city roof down in Greenwich Village.
Hopper’s haunts. Without a single tree
or blade of grass to show, this could be
New York in any season of the year:
winter, summer, spring, the late-day sun
soaked now into those skylights and rustbrick
chimney stacks, with that orange obelisk
filling up the foreground to the right.
It’s all abstract and yet so real, just like
those tar-splayed buckled roofs you ran on
as a boy back in the Forties. In this roofscape,
though, there’s no one to be seen, no human shape,
not even someone’s shadow, as if the scene alone
revealed itself to the beholder. And now, once more,
those ghosts drift up from the caked and sunbaked tar.
And look, there’s your mother, at twenty years of age,
as she tries her best, while managing a smile, to engage
you long enough for the click of someone’s camera,
those shadows edging toward the Fifty-ninth Street
Bridge below, your toddler’s steps making their retreat.
And there you are two years later on that windy rooftop
in your army outfit, East Fifty-First your backdrop
now, as your father looks up to wave as he heads off
to war. And there’s that ziggurat rising half a mile south
they call the Chrysler, replete with its art deco motif,
your one sure beacon when you, six years old then,
walked those winter evenings down Second Avenue
back home, reliving still those flickering scenes
of Roy Rogers and Dale Evans as they yodeled on and on.
Or Autry on his horse riding those western plains.
But what are you to make of all of this? The truth
is you still don’t know, though time is running out
to find some answer. Those stoops and railings
long since turned to dust. Gone too those rows
of rooftops with their narrow alleys in between,
where you learned to jump from one tenement
to the next to escape mad Harry and his gang.
Or that roof my father told me once how the cops
flung some poor kid off when they found him
hiding behind a chimney in the shadow of the El.
Dear God, tell me how to summon up once more
that boy (long gone) in black knickers and starched
white shirt, grinning as his mother snapped
his picture that warm spring day he made his First
Communion. Oh, to feel again if only for a moment,
a moment only, a moment only, that sense
of peace you find here in Edward Hopper’s sun-
drenched rooftop, empty of everyone
except the blessed eye of the beholder, as now
that light and shadow gather here to greet you."

Arab Song,"translated from the French by Emilie Moorhouse

The eye shifts in the night when death arrives
O the white dazzling madness of wings we will never wear
Padded with silence they brush against the arm on the pillow
And open a round eye to the night of the impalpable
The cold woven tuberoses wait on my pupil
I see the moving wallpaper of the horizon shining and restless
Like the quivering skin on a body revealing itself
The hushed swell of my abdomen braces with a twisted fear
I sneeze but do not move
And the eye that cloisters my dreams swims and signals
The eye that invades my nights
The night the night the storm
The blinding eye with strange blooms
The eye sick with images
Chant Arabe 
L’oeil bascule dans la nuit au moment du trépas
O la blanche fulgurante folie des ailes qu’on ne connaît pas
Ouatées de silence elles frôlent le bras sur l’oreiller
Et ouvrent l’œil rond à la nuit de l’impalpable
Le froid tisseur de tubéreuses trépigne sur ma pupille
Je vois glisser la tenture mobile de l’horizon qui rutile et qui s’agite
Telle une peau frémissante sur un corps qui se dérobe
La houle feutrée de mon abdomen se fige de peur démente
J’éternue mais je ne bouge pas
Et l’œil qui cloître mes rêves qui nage et qui clignote
L’œil envahit mes nuits
La nuit la nuit l’orage
L’œil éblouissant aux floraisons étranges
L’œil malade d’images."
[Death is a daisy sleeping],"translated from the French by Emilie Moorhouse
Death is a daisy sleeping
At the foot of a madonna in heat
And those thousand delicate odors
Dark like an armpit, bloody like a heart
Also sleep in the bodies of naked women
Who bed in the fields or search the streets
For the poorly gilded strawberry of love
  La mort est une marguerite qui dort 
Aux pieds d’une madone en chaleur 
Et les mille délicates puanteurs
Sombres comme une aisselle, saignantes comme un cœur
Dorment elles aussi dans les corps des femmes nues 
Qui couchent dans les champs ou qui cherchent dans les rues 
La fraise mal dorée de l’amour"
If Love is For the Fishes,"i breathe them in each night
a shallow breath of scaly skin
i breathe deep & think

i breathe deeper & am thankful
for the lobster’s claw

and dream for their flesh to never know harm nor hurt

i know this is a kind of love
because i think of my family
how they smile & i smile too
i always think of love & soft feather beds
because the water is perfect for me & when i close
my eyes i only see a garden growing upwards

Coda: Refuge,"You gaze at me from above my desk,
unsmiling, eyes daring me, well met
by the lens and fixed. Vexed,
you seem, at standing still. Your body
so small in the jaw of the world—
shoulders pressed forward into
labor’s cast. Quiet and radical and fast.
Fisher of men. Thief. Spy. Most faithless
slave, most faithful sister. It’s a refuge
now, the swamp where you were forced
to plan. And hide and wait. Freeze
and scrounge. Shit and ache and say
goodbye. And travel light. Out
Bestpitch Road, I stand on a bridge,
above still waters that you knew well,
a thick and weedy, fecund hell. A day-
rose moon outshines my face. Weedy
creepers, waters deeper than these boots,
and odors whipping clean away all traces
of my fine perfumes. What blessing
would I have asked back then—
of this refuge, of this both safe
and hostile place? A dryish space
to tuck my head. To rest my bones
as long as the dead."

goes before the judge
to make the case for Fatherhood.
The courtroom is stymied by the apparition.
Rosaries are clutched, prayers whispered.
Even the judge, in her cloak of indecision, leans back.
The mother is there, pushing against silence.
A thousand stories are exchanged.
From the disembodied mouths of the children.
In these halls the word love echoes like a myth.
As if years ago, in some distant land,
existed two birds, who tried forging themselves into one,
but wound up resentful
at the impermanent nature of flight.
Right now, the parents of 14,000 children in cages
still believe in such miracles."

Salvador,"We’ve been sharing a bed for months now
And I wonder, if like married couples,
two people who sleep touching
over a length of time, end up taking on
traits of the other, then what parts of us
are becoming one as we sleep?       
Perhaps I’ll wake up tomorrow with a dance
germinating in my thighs. Perhaps you’ll wake up
with stubble and acid reflux. Somewhere,
between a snore and a fart, you are contemplating
the weight of fatherhood. Tomorrow
the alarm clock will ring, and we will wake up,
father and son staring, into the other silently,
like two moose in a meadow.
I might claim to know some things about you.
Desires you aren’t even aware you have.
You’ll claim to know some things about me.
History I was sure I’ve hidden. When we brush
our teeth, it is our teeth we brush. When you
wash your hands, it’s your grandfather’s
ashy knuckles that soften. I pay attention
to the way you part your hair now.
It’s such a delicate motion. I want to tell you,
Keep that beauty for yourself. Don’t give it
away. But we both know that’s impossible.
We are here to fall. And we are here
to scrape ourselves off the slate. We are here
to give it all away. Crawl back into bed.
Carry what’s left of ourselves
toward a dream."
"Eating the Moon in Cotulla, TX","A trip to Laredo is like breaking open the sky.
Each long row of wheat meets the eye 
before it sloughs into desert, where the occasional hawk, 
in a few concentric turns, identifies a weak movement. 
I know this place. The place in between. 
I have seen limbs of prickly pear hovering in the still, hot air, 
clustered and distorted like a reef in reverse.
I have seen the hay bales lead me to ranch houses 
with tin foil winks on every window 
and a museum of appliances on every porch,
sliding from one world to another,
where there are trucks without wheels, 
willows without spirits, and mesquites with nothing to lose.
  I have seen the sun own the land. I have seen it bake 
into our hands. And I have seen it sleep in a dark coverlet
while the sky opens loose, and the coyotes, in their constellation,
propose a trick. A star crosses with intelligence. 
A rabbit becomes an antique. At the gas station in Cotulla, 
I eat the moon in the form of a pie. A real U.F.O. in cellophane,
a chemically unctuous sweet. Each bite, with the physics of an asteroid,
crumbles onto the asphalt where purpling black spheres of gum
have each staked a claim on the cosmos. There is no claim
that cannot be shifted. There is no orbit that cannot be redone.
I have a stepfather who I call a father, who believes other life forms
are out there, far beyond our boastful sun. And I have seen
this moon pie has no bloodline. I have seen it orbit from
one home to another, a pre-made kindness at a pit stop 
where something in the brush is changing up its cry."
The Civil Power,"translated from the Russian by Seamus Heaney
When the great event was happening on the cross
And the racked godhead perished in extremis,
Then, at that solemn moment, on either side
Of the life-abounding tree, two women stood
                 Steadfast and in pain:
The Virgin Mary and Mary Magdalene.
But nowadays beneath that blessed crossbar
What you see’s not holy women but two guards
Like sentries at the city governor’s door, 
Armed men in shakoes, stern and sinister.
Can someone say why the area is secured?
Is the crucifixion now state-owned and sponsored?
A facility sealed off from thieves and vermin?
Or can it be the authorities imagine
This adds distinction to the king of kings?
Or that this show of force, this sentry-posting,
Can save the master whose obedience
Commits his flesh to the scourge and nail and lance?
Or are they scared that the common people’s presence
Will offend the one who died with criminals
For the whole tribe of Adam? And refuse them entry
So as not to overcrowd the strolling gentry?"
Arion,"translated from the Russian by Seamus Heaney
We were all there in the boat;
Some of us tightening sail,
Some at the heave and haul
Of the oars, vessel and load
Deep surging, our passage silent,
The helmsman buoyed at the helm.
And I, taking all for granted,
Sang to the sailors.
                               A wind
Struck then, a boiling maelstrom.
Helmsman and sailors perished.
Only I, still singing, washed
Ashore by the swell, sing on,
A mystery to myself,
Safe and sound on a rock-shelf
Where my clothes dry in the sun."
The Head of the Cottonmouth,"Why would I abandon the hunger-suffering 
Vulture, spread-winged in the middle of the road
Eating a rabbit while it snows? Wouldn’t you
Want to touch, watch his comrades close down the sky
And, in a black circle, eat red on the white Earth?
And when the hiss of something slithers in—
Panic un-paused—wouldn’t you watch the circle 
Break into black leaves pulled from the earth and flung
Into the falling sky? Wouldn’t you want to be
A servant of this paradise, not a God
In front of a screen, naked, lonely, asking—
No more a God than the crown of vultures
Frightened by a hiss that was a tire deflating?
Why would you trade Paradise for an argument
                                                            About Paradise?"

Held o’er the head of slave and potentate,

Their jaded Myths along the mountain-side;

Where Reason is the prophet and the guide."
"The Luzumiyat of Abu’l-Ala, LXXI","translated from the Arabic by Ameen Rihani
And though around the temple they should run
For seventy times and seven, and in the sun
      Of mad devotion drool, their prayers are still
Like their desires of feasting-fancies spun."
"The Luzumiyat of Abu’l-Ala, CXVI","translated from the Arabic by Ameen Rihani
To clay the mighty Sultan must return
And, chancing, help a praying slave to burn
       His midnight oil before the face of Him,
Who of the Sultan makes an incense urn."
"The Luzumiyat of Abu’l-Ala, LXX","translated from the Arabic by Ameen Rihani
The Prophets, too, among us come to teach,
Are one with those who from the pulpit preach;
      They pray, and slay, and pass away, and yet
Our ills are as the pebbles on the beach."
"The Luzumiyat of Abu’l-Ala, LXIX","translated from the Arabic by Ameen Rihani
And silent drink. The tumult of our mirth
Is worse than our mad welcoming of birth:—
      The thunder hath a grandeur, but the rains,
Without the thunder, quench the thirst of Earth."
"The Luzumiyat of Abu’l-Ala, CXV","translated from the Arabic by Ameen Rihani
The Sultan, too, relinquishing his throne
Must wayfare through the darkening dust alone

Part of the Secret, here and there is blown."

Carouse, ye sovereign lords! The wheel will roll
Forever to confound and to console:
      Who sips to-day the golden cup will drink
Mayhap to-morrow in a wooden bowl—"

For after she declaims upon the vows
Of Faith, she pusillanimously bows

While he and all his courtezans carouse."
"The Luzumiyat of Abu’l-Ala, LXVI","translated from the Arabic by Ameen Rihani
Or in the house of lust. The priestly name
And priestly turban once were those of Shame—

If pulpits tumble down, I’m not to blame."
"The Luzumiyat of Abu’l-Ala, CXIV","translated from the Arabic by Ameen Rihani

Whence does the nettle get its bitter sting?

O Soul, I do not know a single thing!"

The knave in purple breaks his vow anon."

To humankind, O Brother, consecrate
Thy heart, and shun the hundred Sects that prate
      About the things they little know about—
Let all receive thy pity, none thy hate."

Korans and Bibles—even a martyr’s bone,—
      All these and more my heart can tolerate,
For my religion’s love, and love alone."
"The Luzumiyat of Abu’l-Ala, LXI","translated from the Arabic by Ameen Rihani
How oft, when young, my brothers I would shun
If their religious feelings were not spun
      Of my own cobweb, which I find was but
A spider’s revelation of the sun."

Between the white and purple Words of Time
In motley garb with Destiny I rhyme:
      The colored glasses to the water give
The colors of a symbolry sublime."
Poem for a Suicide,"The yellow flowers on the grave
make an arch, they lie 
on a black stone that lies on the ground
like a black door that will always
remain closed down into the earth,
into it is etched the name
of a great poet who believed
he had nothing more to say,
he threw himself into literal water
and everyone has done their mourning 
and been mourned over, and we all 
went on with our shopping, 
I stare at this photograph of that grave
and think you died like him, 
like all the others,
and the yellow flowers 
seem angry, they seem to want to refuse 
to be placed anywhere but in a vase 
next to the living, someday 
all of us will have our names 
etched where we cannot read them,
she who sealed her envelopes
full of poems about doubt with flowers 
called it her “granite lip,” I want mine 
to say Lucky Life, and what would 
a perfect elegy do? place the flowers 
back in the ground? take me 
where I can watch him sit eternally 
dreaming over his typewriter? 
then, at last, will I finally unlearn 
everything? and I admit that yes, 
while I could never leave 
everyone, here at last 
I understand these yellow flowers, 
the names, the black door 
he held open 
and you walked through."

                             xxiv
They are not wisest who are conscious most
That without worldly power, life’s end is lost,
Let lisping lips be offered by a child,
The heart with Wisdom would be reconciled.
                             xxv
Sometimes when in the city’s marketplace
I’ve chanced to greet a friend’s familiar face,
Where the white mosque o’er those who sell and buy
Lifts shining minarets to meet the sky.

When questioned oft by folk incredulous,
My answers they’ve rebuked as nebulous.
“Tell us,” said they, “the secrets of a wine
Which warms the heart, and makes the eye to shine!”

Not of fermented wine that Vision clear!
Soft as the morn! but not of atmosphere!
Bright as Arabia’s Sun! but not of fire.
Spirit of Beauty! drawing nigh and nigher.

Till Thought and Purpose caused the void to leap
When Time and Space were not, but a great Calm
Profound Solemnity!—and then Life’s Balm.

Forth at a “Word” inscrutable in Might,
Created worlds rolled onward thro’ the night.
Dwelling alone, some wiser Law to teach,
Veiled from all things, yet immanent in each!
                             xxx
O, the desire of my toil-stainèd soul!
To rest beneath what seems an endless goal,
To breathe new life, nor doubtfully despond
Of clasping yet once more friends gone beyond!
                             xxxi
For Time’s a thought of space, which men call years,
Fulfilled, when Love shall dry the mourner’s tears,
From seed to blade, from blade to ripen’d sheaf,
No parting is; with one who shareth grief!
                             xxxii
Would I might feel that Sense, which strengthens sight
Which teacheth simple hearts to praise aright,
Then heart would join with lips at shadow-fall
And frail hands stretch to One who loveth all!

So rich in virtue is that gracious Wine!
That one who knoweth not Its name Divine

To speak his love, e’en as a man to maid.

       Will steep her tresses in the saffron dye
Of dawn, and vanish in the morning sheen."
"The Luzumiyat of Abu'l-Ala, LXXXII","translated from the Arabic by Ameen Rihani
Evil and Virtue? Shadows on the street
Of Fate and Vanity,—but shadows meet
     When in the gloaming they are hast’ning forth 
To drink with Night annihilation sweet. "
"The Luzumiyat of Abu’l-Ala, V","translated from the Arabic by Ameen Rihani
Mohammed or Messiah! Hear thou me,
The truth entire nor here nor there can be;

Give all his light to One, I cannot see."
"The Luzumiyat of Abu’l-Ala, IV","translated from the Arabic by Ameen Rihani

To stay the feet of every passer-by:

Are crying up their wares.—Oh! let them cry."

Of blond Illusion and its golden snare."

The flame divine hid in a drop of dew. "

And why in this dark Kingdom tribute pay? 
With clamant multitudes why stop to pray? 
     Oh! hear the inner Voice:—“If thou’lt be right, 
Do what they deem is wrong, and go thy way.”"
"The Luzumiyat of Abu'l-Ala, LXXVII","translated from the Arabic by Ameen Rihani
Among us falsehood is proclaimed aloud, 
But truth is whispered to the phantom bowed

While Right and Reason are denied a shroud. "
"The Luzumiyat of Abu'l-Ala, LXXVI","translated from the Arabic by Ameen Rihani
Among the crumbling ruins of the creeds
The Scout upon his camel played his reeds

The pasture here is full of noxious weeds.”"

The saint’s devotion and the sinner’s weal;

Another said:   “The creeping worm hath shown,
In her discourse on human flesh and bone,
      That Man was once the bed on which she slept—
The walking dust was once a thing of stone.”"
"The Luzumiyat of Abu’l-Ala, XLVII","translated from the Arabic by Ameen Rihani
I heard it whispered in the cryptic streets
Where every sage the same dumb shadow meets:
      “We are but words fallen from the lipe of Time
Which God, that we might understand, repeats.”"
"The Luzumiyat of Abu’l-Ala, XLVI","translated from the Arabic by Ameen Rihani
And why so much ado, and wherefore lay
The burden of the years upon the day
      Of thy vain dreams?   Who polishes his sword
Morning and eve will polish it away."
"The Luzumiyat of Abu’l-Ala, XLV","translated from the Arabic by Ameen Rihani

Hither we come unknowing, hence we go;
Unknowing we are messaged to and fro;

And sky—the suns and stars we think we know."
"The Luzumiyat of Abu’l-Ala, XLIII","translated from the Arabic by Ameen Rihani
How like a door the knowledge we attain,
Which door is on the bourne of the Inane;

It closes and in darkness we remain."

The I in me standing upon the brink
Would leap into the Well to get a drink;

And cowardly behind my logic slink."
"The Luzumiyat of Abu’l-Ala, XXXVII","translated from the Arabic by Ameen Rihani
Ah, many have I seen of those who fell
While drawing, with a swagger, from the Well;

In Search of History,"We go in search of history and find
a guillotine at a garage sale where the lady
of the house in curlers and stretch pants
sits in a lawn chair knitting, knitting.
The guillotine is ugly but has historic
value, we say, and take it home
to replace the wagon wheel in the yard,
but we can’t get the damned thing to work.
Nobody told us the lubricant of history
is blood. We thought it was money.
Is Grandma’s pickle crock historical?
How much is it worth? Could we convert
the rusted old tricycle into a fountain?
But history sings like a chain saw
in the woods, a freight train
in the night. History is the grizzled
Viet Nam veteran with his dog and sign,
begging at the intersection. History
is the yellow detritus of used condoms
at the edge of Lovers’ Lane.
History is a lottery ticket, a truck full
of cocaine approaching the border crossing,
a drunk on the wrong side of the highway.
History is hallucination, fantasy, a mirage
in the desert, as blind as justice.
Historians suffer from the fever of time
but never know what time it is.
They are mad poets making up stories.
The history of war passes a hat and we
put our children in it. Then somebody
gives us stars to put in our windows,
one star for each child.
On the streets of history there are more
guns than lovers, but who could stay
indoors on such a day when the chestnuts
have leafed out at last and lilacs
fill the air with the heartbreak of history."
from “The Ode of Ímr el Káis”,"translated from the Arabic by Lady Anne Blunt and Wilfrid Scawen Blunt
Friend, thou seest the lightning. Mark where it wavereth,
   gleameth like fingers twisted, clasped in the cloud-rivers.
Like a lamp new-lighted, so is the flash of it,
   trimmed by a hermit nightly pouring oil-sésame.
Stood I long a watcher, twin-friends how dear with me,
   till in Othéyb it faded, ended in Dáriji.
By its path we judged it: rain over Káttan is;
   far in Sitár it falleth, streameth in Yáthboli.
Gathereth gross the flood-head dammed in Kutéyfati.
   Woe to the trees, the branched ones! Woe the kanáhboli!
El Kanáan hath known it, quailed from the lash of it.
   Down from their lairs it driveth hot-foot the ibexes.
Known it too hath Téyma; standeth no palm of her
   there, nor no house low-founded,—none but her rock-buildings.
Stricken stood Thabíra whelmed by the rush of it,
   like an old chief robe-folded, bowed in his striped mantle.
Nay, but he Mujéymir, tall-peaked at dawn of day, 
   showed like a spinster’s distaff tossed on the flood-water.
Cloud-wrecked lay the valley piled with the load of it, 
   high as in sacks the Yemámi heapeth his corn-measures.
Seemed it then the song-birds, wine-drunk at sun-rising, 
   loud through the valley shouted, maddened with spiceries,
While the wild beast corpses, grouped like great bulbs up-torn
   cumbered the hollow places, drowned in the night-trouble."
"[When you told us our glances, soft, timid, and mild,]","Translated from the Arabic by Joseph Dacre Carlyle 
When you told us our glances, soft, timid, and mild,
      Could occasion such wounds in the heart,
Can ye wonder that yours, so ungovern’d and wild,
      Some wounds to our cheeks should impart?
The wounds on our cheeks, are but transient, I own,
      With a blush they appear and decay;
But those on the heart, fickle youths, ye have shewn
      To be even more transient than they."
Les Cloches,"Translated by Andrea Cohen

Mon beau tzigane mon amant
Écoute les cloches qui sonnent
Nous nous aimions éperdument
Croyant n’être vus de personne

Mais nous étions bien mal cachés
Toutes les cloches à la ronde
Nous ont vus du haut des clochers
Et le disent à tout le monde

Demain Cyprien et Henri
Marie Ursule et Catherine
La boulangère et son mari
Et puis Gertrude ma cousine

Souriront quand je passerai
Je ne saurai plus où me mettre
Tu seras loin Je pleurerai
J’en mourrai peut-être
The Bells

My handsome gypsy my love
Listen to the bells that ring
We loved each other unbridled
Thinking no one could see us

But we were poorly hidden
All the bells everywhere
Have seen us from steeples
And they’re telling everyone

Tomorrow Cyprien and Henri
Marie Ursule and Catherine
The baker’s wife and her husband
And then my cousin Gertrude

Will smile when I walk by
I won’t know where to put myself
You’ll be far away I’ll cry
I’ll die of it maybe"
Folk Song,"Let me enter the afterlife lithe not plodding. 
Rise out of this heavy peasantry. Lithe 
and cool as a battery-powered flame, 
not fire. My feet
are short and wide. The soles, stained 
with mulberries. I have never been lithe,
streamlined, pedicured, compressed, minimal, ergonomic,
silver
fuselage cutting the air. 
In my herringbone skirt and shirttail out, I am a slob.
What is a slob but a knob of thickness, a mushroom
stem, a beer stein Mozart stole from the Hofbräuhaus while writing
Idomeneo.
My stylist, gravity. Memory a tree so loaded with fruit and birds the tips 
of the branches rake the ground. 
By lithe I do not mean in body, do I?
Do I mean in soul? 
To be one of those green-eyed ones others refer to as
aquamarine. Empty 
of ancestors. Face clean 
of lipstick smears and other gestures of artifice.
Feet a rare triple-A, so narrow there aren’t shoes 
that won’t chafe. Skin easy to tear, 
like Kleenex we turned into carnations for parade floats.
Those drinks from the soda fountain we called Green Rivers.
Green and sweet, without flavor, but delicious.
I am too tired to hold up this heavy self.
Of selfhood I worked so hard to earn. Of work I worked so hard
to avoid. Of the working class. My class. Its itches and psychological riches.
Its notions and values and humble achievements.
Of this town which inhabitants speak of with endearments
as if it were a child. As if it’s not like every other brat.
Town with its river, drunk on itself. Its shitty Xmas ornaments 
and fall-down-fucked-up Santa on a raft tethered to the river bank. 
Its tiny museum
built around the star of the show, a lamb born with two heads.
Every town has a two-headed something. It doesn’t mean
anything.
You know what? I want to be rich and lithe.
Rich, with a lyric gift and a song 
like a white-throated sparrow. I am vulture-heavy. 
My stories are caskets filled with black feathers,
the lids pounded shut with railroad spikes.
The gravedigger is noodling Melba, the widow-woman,
and a hognose is consuming a toy train on cemetery lane.
Let me resurrect beyond the bracken
fronds and the three-legged stool and catgut guitar 
and this two-ton song from the mouth 
of a wax museum troubadour."
After the Reading,"someone  asked  me  if  my husband  left me,  or if I left him. After
the   reading,  someone   asked   me   if   there   was  a   chance  for
reconciliation  as  I shoved a  pulled  pork sandwich  in my mouth
with  Carolina  Gold BBQ  sauce  oozing  out  the  sides  like  neon
yellow  lava.  After  the reading,  someone  asked  me if I still pray
to  God  as  I  sipped a  fizzy Diet Coke  and the ice cubes huddled
and  softly clinked  around my  upper lip  leaving a wet mustache.
After  the  reading,  someone said they had been divorced too and
then  scurried away  in a way that I completely  understood. After
the  reading,  a  woman told me I was worthy as if I was shattered 
while   I   picked   up   crudités   with  a   copious  dollop  of  ranch
dressing.  After  the  reading,  a  white woman thanked me for my 
“angry poems.”  I  told  her they were about my joy,  and then she
touched  my  forearm  and  said,  “No,  they were about my rage.”
Insisting.   After   the  reading,   someone  said   they   cried,   and
another  gave me a kind word.  Thank you. After the after,  I went   
home and changed into my cheetah print pajamas. I wrapped my
hair and  brushed my teeth.  I got in bed and played a  sci-fi show
on  my  laptop.  The  actors  on the show were trying to find a way
to talk  to aliens by  using  math  and pheromones.  I  googled the
height   of  one  of  the   actors.  He  is  6' 4"".   I   fell   asleep  while 
watching   the    show   about    the    people   in   space   trying   to   
communicate  in  first  contact,  intergalactic  noises  beeped  and
swirled around the room like bees."
yes the business folk,"yes, the business folk rush thru midtown.
they talk math that equates to foreclosures. 
yes, the trash has to be taken out
& dinner chewed. when i was a child, 
i saw a house on our block burn. the smoke
was a serpent coiling up getting thicker &
then it was gone. the firemen left the house a puddle,
but what about the smoke? it was easy, then, 
to forget what i couldn’t see. such is life:
the dishes keep piling up. why stop
just because there’s a warm breeze in January.
there are bills to pay and bills about to come due.
smoke thins into air, the serpent i saw as a kid 
never disappeared. it’s not even hiding. 
most folks don’t know the sound of smoke. 
though they hear it. though smoke gets mistaken 
for silence. most folks think they’re saying nothing 
when they’re saying the most."
"Taurus Sun, Cancer Moon, Scorpio Rising","Sigh of the Santa Ana through the chaparral clinging to the mountain. Through the sunflowers at night, searching for the sun, along the river no longer a river. The wind kissing the river, its stone face, and making each stone a matchbook. A match. A book on fire. The river a library on fire. The wind a woman running through the valley on fire. Searching. The sunflowers turning toward her. Her nightgown a book turning its own bright pages in the wind. Smoke the color of chaparral. Smoke clinging to her, making her a mountain of smoke. A valley of light. A sigh.
             *
You’re too afraid of who you are to know who you can be. You’re too afraid of being happy. You’re too happy being afraid. You’re afraid you’re happy. You’re afraid, the way a broken bowl gilded and glued back together with gold is still broken, that knowing makes no difference. You’re broken, still, but you’re happy. You’re afraid, too, but still, you’re happy. You’re who you can be, already, whether or not you know. You’re different, already. You don’t need to know to know. You’re ready.
             *
Yesterday, when the cake with thirty candles came out, I thought, closing my eyes, that my wish would be to go back to the moment my mother brought me home to East Mountain View, furnished with only her vanity, the mirror with us waving at us, at once Hello and Goodbye, and that I would wish to hold her bright and broken face, to look at her as she was and not as either of us wanted her to be, telling her as if telling myself that we were doing our best, and yet, today, opening my eyes and looking into my own vanity, smoking a cigarette, the tip like a sunflower scorched from searching and searching still by the light that scorched it, I think, instead, that my wish will be to keep going forward, to see what else will happen with this life, and I think I will."
Prayer of the Shy Forest,"As a child, when I closed my eyes to pray I saw a hissing
wall of TV snow. The tighter I closed them, the harder it
hissed. A song with two notes. AH ee AH ee AH ee AH . . .
But I kept coming back, like I kept playing, I know you
are but what am I? with my older brother who never lost
because, “I’m not your real brother, dork.” Kept coming
back. “Jesus, I made you a drawing of our yard.” Kept on
till the day Bigfoot made of prayer snow strolled through
the prayer snow. “Bigfoot?” AH ee AH ee AH ee AH . . .
Oh well. I knew it wasn’t indifference. Bigfoot was shy
like coyotes and me. I promised him I’d only pray for things
I really needed, and I’d never sneak up on him and scream,
“PAY ATTENTION!” like my tap dance teacher did: right
in my ear when I was listening to ""Feelings,” wholly
enrapt, captivated. People who do that can go to hell."
"The Luzumiyat of Abu’l-Ala, XXX","  translated from the Arabic by Ameen Rihani
Or wilt thou commerce have with those who make
Rugs of the rainbow, rainbows of the snake,
       Snakes of a staff, and other wondrous things?—
The burning thirst a mirage can not slake."
"The Luzumiyat of Abu’l-Ala, XXIX","translated from the Arabic by Ameen Rihani
By fearing whom I trust I find my way
To truth; by trusting wholly I betray
     The trust of wisdom; better far is doubt
Which brings the false into the light of day."
"The Luzumiyat of Abu’l-Ala, XXVIII","translated from the Arabic by Ameen Rihani
Seek not the Tavern of Belief, my friend,
Until the Sakis there their morals mend;
      A lie imbibed a thousand lies will breed,
And thou’lt become a Saki in the end."
"The Luzumiyat of Abu’l-Ala, XXVII","  translated from the Arabic by Ameen Rihani
So, too, the creeds of Man: the one prevails
Until the other comes; and this one fails
      When that one triumphs; ay, the lonesome world
Will always want the latest fairy-tales."
"The Luzumiyat of Abu’l-Ala, XXVI","translated from the Arabic by Ameen Rihani
And like a spider’s house or sparrow’s nest,
The Sultan’s palace, though upon the crest
      Of glory’s mountain, soon or late must go:
Ay, all abodes to ruin are addrest."
Thirty-Seventh Year,"At the start of this narrative, I will pretend
Not to be alive, not to be
Speaking to you from the living earth.
To help you. I will pretend
The circumstances of our being
Here, together, are casual—
And not incidental
Of this awkward dilemma: How to co-exist
When you would like me dead.
For simplicity. For lack of threat.
In this narrative I will look
At you from a distance, as into the future,
No more real than I am,
Sitting here in my off-white body which I can feel
But is somehow less important, less
Urgent than the problem it poses. 
Sometimes, when I write this kind of narrative,
My mind flees and all I see above is text
At once strange, because I don’t know
How to hold it, and familiar, because I wrote it—
Send out the memo, I’m nearly done here.
How much more of this life to live? 30 years, if I’m lucky,
I bet. If my life ends, will my brothers’ finally begin?
Who made my mother? Who killed my father who lives?"
While I Wash My Face I Ask Impossible Questions of Myself and Those Who Love Me,"Specks of toothpaste fleck the mirror.
A fan spins dust in the hall.
I find this is it impossible to accept
So I wait for a new starting point
As though life will begin there and then.
Do you know what I mean?
Not what I’m saying, what I mean.
Is it possible my function is to hold
All the intricate, interstitial pain
And articulate clarity?
Tie a boat to my wrist, I sprout wings.
Give me a pair of shoes, I grow fins.
Once an hour I trick myself into focus:
I look into the glass as I look through it.
When the new beginning comes, what then?
Does life suddenly reset like an Atari?
Does meaning emerge
Assertively and without invitation?
The task is to live well enough with you.
But how? How do you know what you want
If you don’t tell you? If you don’t hear you?"
Trace Evidence,"When I say But mother, Black or not Black,
Of course we are polyethnic, your look does not change
Though it does harden, a drying clay bust
Abandoned or deliberately incomplete,
All the features carved in
Except the eyes. What I’m trying –
I mean – You are an Arab, yes,
By culture, by language, and in part by blood; by blood
You are also Black African – and when, then, I say
And probably a fair amount of European, too – the lights,
Though we’re standing at the corner of 195th and Jerome,
Turn up somehow
Tracing an outline of you onto the armory’s sharp red brick, the El
Barreling up from the tunnel like a surge of magma reaching
For air and as I wait for it to pass so that you can
Hear me again, so that I can hear myself at last
Say But here, for me… Don’t you see – ?
Your face hangs on the fair of fair amount – heavy drops
Of oil, or old rain, falling onto us from the tracks – almost willing away
The layer of long-dead men flattened onto it, and the desperate
Rest of you, until I say with my looking
Through the unbearable human noise, My sweet selfless mother, it is
Fine, it is fine. For us here now I will be the first of our line."
"Grass, 1967","When I open  the  door,  I smile  and wave to people who  only
have  eyes  and  who  are  infinitely joyful.  I  see  my  children,
but  only the backs  of their  heads.  When  they turn around,  I
don’t recognize  them.  They  once had mouths  but  now  only
have  eyes.  I  want  to leave  the  room  but   when  I do, I  am
outside,  and everyone  else  is inside. So next time, I open the
door  and  stay  inside.  But  then  everyone is  outside.  Agnes
said that  solitude  and  freedom  are  the same.  My solitude is
like the  grass.  I  become  so  aware of its presence  that it too
begins to feel like an audience.  Sometimes  my solitude grabs
my  phone  and  takes a  selfie,  posts  it somewhere for others
to   see   and    like.    Sometimes   people   comment  on   how
beautiful  my  solitude is  and  sometimes  my  solitude  replies
with  a  heart.  It  begins  to   follow  the  accounts  of  solitudes
that  are half its age.  What if my solitude is  depressed?  What
if even my solitude doesn’t want to be alone?"
My Lebanon,"I dream of Lebanon by an azure sea;
Wave-kissed shores, and rocky glades;
Snowcaps on mountains, glistening gorgeously;
O sweet-scented pines’ serenades.
I see a land laden with fruits of the earth;
A tropical jewel ablaze 
With myriad flowers and wee children’s mirth.
Rainbow sunsets prolong their days. 
Purple dusk is tinted by a lustrous moon 
And broidered with a million stars.
For lullabies—the sea plays a crooning tune 
Of golden notes on silv’ry bars. 
Blessed of Christ, O, Lebanon, my paeans 
Echo the lyrics of sages.
Thy beauty is lovelier than gossamer dreams. 
Thy glory shall crown all ages."
Western Edge,"I need you 
the way astonishment, 
which is really just 
the disruption of routine,
requires routine. 
Isn’t there
a shock, though— 
a thrill— 
to having done
what we had to?
Unequally, but
in earnest, we love
as we can, 
he used to mumble, 
not so much his
mouth moving, 
more the words 
themselves sort of 
staggering around lost 
inside it . . . Now
show me 
exactly what
you think being brave
is."
"Virginia, Autumn","October, I’m dragging the dog away from perfect birds
lifeless on the pavement. By the water, boys in dress blues
with bayonets, the blistered hulls of boxships. Everything 
is sunshine. Everything is dead, or dying, and this isn’t 
a new thought. I grew up here, but farther from the ocean.
Each April, they took us to the battlefield, marched us
in schoolhouse lines up courthouse steps: here 
is where the war ended. Never mind that it was fall 
before the final battleship lowered its flag; never mind 
that we still haven’t fired the last gun. What business 
do I have wanting a baby here: in this body 
where I can’t keep my balance, this country
where we can’t keep anything alive that needs us, 
or dares not to, not even the switchgrass 
pale and starved for groundwater? And still, 
I do want. I search the news for mention of the birds, 
whatever poison or disease I’m sure is claiming them 
in such great numbers: meadowlarks, house wrens, 
chickadees, starlings. Once even a gray gull, pulled 
open at the chest before we found him, hollowed
of his organs. It takes a long time—too long— 
for me to understand the sun in this season 
is blinding, and the birds are flying into windows
all around me, fourteen stories up. Flying into glass
and falling. What we love is rarely blameless.
Is it a failure that I wouldn’t trade this brightness?
I imagine pointing upward for my daughter:
Look, there, how it catches in the changing trees."
I Dare You,"It’s autumn, and we’re getting rid
of books, getting ready to retire,
to move some place smaller, more
manageable. We’re living in reverse,
age-proofing the new house, nothing
on the floors to trip over, no hindrances
to the slowed mechanisms of our bodies,
a small table for two. Our world is
shrinking, our closets mostly empty,
gone the tight skirts and dancing shoes,
the bells and whistles. Now, when
someone comes to visit and admires
our complete works of Shakespeare,
the hawk feather in the open dictionary,
the iron angel on a shelf, we say
take them. This is the most important
time of all, the age of divestment,
knowing what we leave behind is
like the fragrance of blossoming trees
that grows stronger after
you’ve passed them, breathing
them in for a moment before
breathing them out. An ordinary
Tuesday when one of you says
I dare you, and the other one
just laughs."
Youth and Age,"In my youth the heart of dawn was in my heart, and the songs of April were in my ears.
But my soul was sad unto death, and I knew not why. Even unto this day I know not why I was sad.
But now, though I am with eventide, my heart is still veiling dawn,
And though I am with autumn, my ears still echo the songs of spring.
But my sadness has turned into awe, and I stand in the presence of life and life’s daily miracles.
The difference between my youth which was my spring, and these forty years, and they are my autumn, is the very difference that exists between flower and fruit.
A flower is forever swayed with the wind and knows not why and wherefore.
But the fruit overladen with the honey of summer, knows that it is one of life’s home-comings, as a poet when his song is sung knows sweet content,
Though life has been bitter upon his lips.
In my youth I longed for the unknown, and for the unknown I am still longing.
But in the days of my youth longing embraced necessity that knows naught of patience.
Today I long not less, but my longing is friendly with patience, and even waiting.
And I know that all this desire that moves within me is one of those laws that turns universes around one another in quiet ecstasy, in swift passion which your eyes deem stillness, and your mind a mystery.
And in my youth I loved beauty and abhorred ugliness, for beauty was to me a world separated from all other worlds.
But now that the gracious years have lifted the veil of picking-and-choosing from over my eyes, I know that all I have deemed ugly in what I see and hear, is but a blinder upon my eyes, and wool in my ears;
And that our senses, like our neighbors, hate what they do not understand. 
And in my youth I loved the fragrance of flowers and their color. 
Now I know that their thorns are their innocent protection, and if it were not for that innocence they would disappear forevermore.
And in my youth, of all seasons I hated winter, for I said in my aloneness, “Winter is a thief who robs the earth of her sun-woven garment, and suffers her to stand naked in the wind.” 
But now I know that in winter there is re-birth and renewal, and that the wind tears the old raiment to cloak her with a new raiment woven by the spring. 
And in my youth I would gaze upon the sun of the day and the stars of the night, saying in my secret, “How small am I, and how small a circle my dream makes.”
But today when I stand before the sun or the stars I cry, “The sun is close to me, and the stars are upon me;” for all the distances of my youth have turned into the nearness of age; 
And the great aloneness which knows not what is far and what is near, nor what is small nor great, has turned into a vision that weighs not nor does it measure. 
In my youth I was but the slave of the high tide and the ebb tide of the sea, and the prisoner of half moons and full moons. 
Today I stand at this shore and I rise not nor do I go down. 
Even my roots once every twenty-eight days would seek the heart of the earth.
And on the twenty-ninth day they would rise toward the throne of the sky. 
And on that very day the rivers in my veins would stop for a moment, and then would run again to the sea. 
Yes, in my youth I was a thing, sad and yielding, and all the seasons played with me and laughed in their hearts.
And life took a fancy to me and kissed my young lips, and slapped my cheeks. 
Today I play with the seasons. And I steal a kiss from life’s lips ere she kisses my lips. 
And I even hold her hands playfully that she may not strike my cheek. 
In my youth I was sad indeed, and all things seemed dark and distant. 
Today, all is radiant and near, and for this I would live my youth and the pain of my youth, again and yet again."
"The Luzumiyat of Abu’l-Ala, XXV","translated from the Arabic by Ameen Rihani
Upon the threshing-floor of life I burn
Beside the Winnower a word to learn;
        And only this:   Man’s of the soil and sun,
And to the soil and sun he shall return."
The Little Towns of West Texas,"know all the roads go somewhere else
and never come back. They know
Heaven is directly above them
and from it comes great suffering.
In their fierce localities they suffer
without complaint. They believe
in their names and in the Holy Ghost
whose tongues of fire surround them.
They are covered with cotton silt,
insulated from the cold and the world
as if wearing a coat of frost all year.
They are mirages of mica shimmering
in the distance, moving always ahead
of the traveler. No stranger
can enter them, no native can leave.
Their seasons are summer and winter,
the hot wind and the cold. Spring
avoids them and goes a different way.
At night the wind spins them upward
into the darkness. At dawn it drops them
back to earth in no particular order.
If a house is found closer to the road
or at a different angle, nobody notices.
The horizon is always the same.
The wind flays everything equally.
Near the graveyards of the little towns
of West Texas beer cans are crucified
on fence posts and shot full of holes
The wind plays them like flutes. Coyotes
answer with voices that could wake
the dead. But the dead sleep on,
having everything they ever wanted,
a cool, dark place to rest where the wind
cannot rattle the lids of their coffins
and the sun no longer torments them.
Their mouths are pale crescent moons
drawn down over teeth they paid for
and intend to keep. They await
no other transfiguration, having heard
a voice roaring out of the desert
and it was not a comfort to them.
Now they sleep without dreams,
rocked by the rhythm of the pump’s
heartbeat and the faint susurrus of oil
sliding like from beneath them.

The Room,"I found myself in the middle of a room
I barely recognized, a whiteboard
with no lesson on it, walls
wanting for color. The hands of the clock
above the door had been removed.
And my friends had left their seats
in long ordinary rows, in rows
they’d never in their lives leave them in.
They must be waiting in the wings,
cheering me on—I could sense it.
All I had to do was pick up the marker
and draw what I remembered
of the room when the room was full.
Instead I stood there, scrubbing,
until there was no board, no boy.
My hand went up, my hand went down."
Italian Square,"Hecht saw a hill here.
It turned out to be a vision

half symbol, half memory.
And in a memorable

said here lies the home of human nature.
Glück studied the moon above it
while reinventing Pavese
for the first time.
As if it were a sore subject
nettling a family, her country
remains unnamed.
Her village is any village,
her lettuces plain lettuce.
McHugh found poetry
in the silence of its statues
and when Hugo heard
Kennedy had been shot
Italians chased him across the square.
At their “noisy knives” of “why”
he wept like a “perfect wop.”
Wilbur fell in love with the music
a wall-fountain made
but by the end of the century
Henri Cole found nothing there
but bobbing Fanta cans,
a kind of poetry dead,
and the freedom one feels
when things have changed for good."
Faker,"I have a sensitive-looking face, which I use to advantage.
At night I take my sensitive-looking face outside
where people are gathered at tables, posting pictures

like a sign for the living. I want them to see my sign,
my outside face, through which all this feeling is funneled."
Teachers,"One of them in your dream saying memory is genius.
One of them in your dream lamenting the word dream,
quoting someone in your dream, saying imagination is,
face it, more fun with others, the trick is to read someone
beside yourself, then take a long look at yourself
in the mirror and say, “You’re a genius, you’re a genius...”
One of them in your dream reading from the blank page.
One of them in your dream: Etna at the end of a street.
One of them never in. One of them in the room pacing
endlessly, at the board, and going on about sources.
One of them saying, “Empty.” One of them, “Open.”
One of them in your dream reading from the black page:
Children, go home, before it gets too dark.
If you don’t go home before the light has gone,
If you don’t go home before the night has come,
Listen to me, you will be lost in the dark,
Listen to me, your joy will turn into sorrow.
Children, go home, before it gets to be dark."
Terrarium,"Taken in, fed perlite and pebbles
so as to appear at rest on eggshells
or moons, then left to germinate
in my segregated cell, live on my own
vapors, as artificial light and heat
enter through a clear wall,

though I’m small and tucked away.
Why should I mind being ignored
during business hours or belittled
for my ornamental nature?
Once a week I’m taken down,
my top’s removed, and it’s water,
water, water—or a mild toxin.
Waiting here, I know I’m not alone."
"[When night draws on, remembering keeps me wakeful]","translated from the Arabic by Reynold A. Nicholson
When night draws on, remembering keeps me wakeful 
And hinders my rest with grief upon grief returning 
For Ṣakhr. What a man was he on the day of battle, 
When, snatching their chance, they swiftly exchange the spear-thrusts! 
Ah, never of woe like this in the world of spirits 
I heard, or of loss like mine in the heart of woman. 
What Fortune might send, none stronger than he to bear it; 
None better to meet the trouble with mind unshaken; 
The kindest to help, wherever the need was sorest: 
They all had of him a boon—wife, friend, and suitor. 
O Ṣakhr! I will ne’er forget thee until in dying 
part from my soul, and earth for my tomb is cloven. 
The rise of the sun recalls to me Ṣakhr my brother, 
And him I remember also at every sunset."
On Moving,"Like butter, gone. I’m moving on, because it would be ludicrous to stay. It feels like a return (to sanity), although I’ve never been. (I’ve never lived a mile west of Illinois.) “I come home from the soaring,” Rilke wrote in The Inner Sky, which I take as imperative (omit the “I”): to ground, return to Earth, to grind the fable of my life down like orpiment into a yellow ash and tie my body to the floor. Rilke writes of God (“still roaring in my ears”) but God, for me (today) is fear. Goodbye to my deteriorating house. Delirium. I’m out the door. Stasis is a sieve through which I drag myself. 
 Literature feels / far away. Black bulls grazing / beyond a pale hill."
anti poetica,"who cares how long i’ve spent with my poems—those shit psalms those rats of my soul—head first thru the window me at their ankles demanding substance, revelation, sudden gravity—shamed of my leafless, drug shanked brain—this grey popper worn hell—that dark dull circle i try to conquer beauty & the state from within. i’m not revolutionary i’m regular. nothing radical in being the enemy of america, the country of enemies. we find our laughter between the horror. stop asking me to explain having a body & a mind & a heart—their harmonies, their plots to murder each other. i’ve lived long in a low solstice—wife of a pipe & the blue lit plain—leo trash—saved by occasional dick & the knowledge of my mother, friends i confess my pocked seasons only after their caul. arachnid moods—self-cornered—text back weak—i haven’t been much lately—the dark season lasted years, swallowing seasons, collecting itself in my shallows like a motor-sheered fish. where did the poems go? what is their trouble? what kind of water is i?"

            delight, in a glittering wave,
singing karaoke
            Honky Tonk Woman in your truck
to your women’s ice hockey 
           team—bobbing back and forth

and over me, even
            at that distance,

floor of the peripeteia,
           where weeks before
my brother, visiting
            the same cousin
in silvery, wind-beaten Beaufort, 
           North Carolina,
nearly bled out at the foot
           of the bed, a jagged glass
in his right hand. Were it not  
           for the crash, Tipper
would not have found
           him till morning.
I’m not clear on why men
            like you can take me
down so completely.
            Why I think it would
be amusing.
           You’ve put me down
from the get-go. Craving
           is a hard mistress—a hard and
charismatic mother—.

Our Casuarina Tree,"Like a huge Python, winding round and round  
   The rugged trunk, indented deep with scars,  
   Up to its very summit near the stars,  
A creeper climbs, in whose embraces bound  
   No other tree could live. But gallantly        
The giant wears the scarf, and flowers are hung  
In crimson clusters all the boughs among,  
   Whereon all day are gathered bird and bee;  
And oft at nights the garden overflows  
With one sweet song that seems to have no close,          
Sung darkling from our tree, while men repose.  
When first my casement is wide open thrown  
   At dawn, my eyes delighted on it rest;  
   Sometimes, and most in winter,—on its crest  
A gray baboon sits statue-like alone        
   Watching the sunrise; while on lower boughs  
His puny offspring leap about and play;  
And far and near kokilas hail the day;  
   And to their pastures wend our sleepy cows;  
And in the shadow, on the broad tank cast          
By that hoar tree, so beautiful and vast,  
The water-lilies spring, like snow enmassed.  
But not because of its magnificence  
   Dear is the Casuarina to my soul:  
   Beneath it we have played; though years may roll,        
O sweet companions, loved with love intense,  
   For your sakes, shall the tree be ever dear.  
Blent with your images, it shall arise  
In memory, till the hot tears blind mine eyes!  
   What is that dirge-like murmur that I hear        
Like the sea breaking on a shingle-beach?  
It is the tree’s lament, an eerie speech,  
That haply to the unknown land may reach.  
Unknown, yet well-known to the eye of faith!  
   Ah, I have heard that wail far, far away        
   In distant lands, by many a sheltered bay,  
When slumbered in his cave the water-wraith  
   And the waves gently kissed the classic shore  
Of France or Italy, beneath the moon,  
When earth lay trancèd in a dreamless swoon:      
   And every time the music rose,—before  
Mine inner vision rose a form sublime,  
Thy form, O Tree, as in my happy prime  
I saw thee, in my own loved native clime.  
Therefore I fain would consecrate a lay        
   Unto thy honor, Tree, beloved of those  
   Who now in blessed sleep, for aye, repose,
Dearer than life to me, alas! were they!  
   Mayst thou be numbered when my days are done  
With deathless trees—like those in Borrowdale,        
Under whose awful branches lingered pale  
   “Fear, trembling Hope, and Death, the skeleton,  
And Time the shadow;” and though weak the verse  
That would thy beauty fain, oh fain rehearse,  
May Love defend thee from Oblivion’s curse."
Ubi Sunt,"Where are the good ones:
the beautiful, strong, and
virtuous figures of yore?
Probably where the moon is,
hung aloft in effulgent skies:
eating nails for breakfast,
dying in childbirth, then
resurrecting to give it all
away, cyclically, once more. 
I don’t want to be the moon,
I said to Dick on the casting
couch: I want to be a flower
no one can touch without dying
of hope of touching it again.
Something rare and exotic:
throaty stamen, purple pistil.
Something that just stands
on the stage and screams.
Alas, that role is taken,
said Dick, by Suzanne.
Figures, I said. How
about the wild river,
he suggested, kindly.
Or a creek, brook,
rivulet, rill, stream?
But where do I empty,
I asked, before agreeing:
in an ocean, sea, or lake,
or do I just flow into the
ground, a dried-up shrew?
That’s between you and your
character to decide, he said.
The river, you mean, I said.
Yes, he said. For god’s sake,
you’re a woman. Just be you.  "
Jungle Taste,"There is a coarseness
In the songs of black men
Coarse as the songs
Of the sea,
There is a weird strangeness
In the songs of black men
Which sounds not strange
To me.
There is beauty
In the faces of black women,
Jungle beauty
And mystery
Dark hidden beauty
In the faces of black women,
Which only black men
See.  "
South Street,"(Philadelphia, Pa.)
South Street is not beautiful,
But the songs of people there
Hold the beauty of the jungle,
And the fervidness of prayer.
South Street has no mansions,
But the hands of South Street men
Built pyramids along the Nile
That Time has failed to rend.
South Street is America,
Breast of the foster mother
Where a thousand ill-kept children
Vie for suck, with one another."
Portrait,"Her eyes?   Dark pools of deepest shade,
    Like sylvan lakes that lie
In some sequestered forest glade
    Beneath a starry sky.
Her cheeks?   The ripened chestnut’s hue,—
    Rich autumn’s sun-kissed brown!
Caressed by sunbeams dancing through
    Red leaves that flutter down.
Her form?   A slender pine that sways
    Before the murmuring breeze
In summer, when the south wind plays
    Soft music through the trees.
Herself?   A laughing, joyous sprite
    Who smiles from dawn till dark,
As lovely as a summer night
    And carefree as a lark."
To Melody,"I think that man hath made no beauteous thing
More lovely than a glorious melody
That soars aloft in splendor, full and free,
And graceful as a swallow on the wing!
A melody that seems to move, and sing,
And quiver, in its radiant ecstasy,
That bends and rises like a slender tree
Which sways before the gentle winds of Spring!
Ah, men will ever love thee, holy art!
For thou, of all the blessings God hath given,
Canst best revive and cheer the wounded heart
And nearest bring the weary soul to Heaven!
Of all God’s precious gifts, it seems to me,
The choicest is the gift of melody."
The Close of the Day,"“To meet and then to part,” and that is all,
To slowly turn an album’s crusty leaves,
To see the faces and the scenes recall,
Are things that in a lifetime one achieves.
To wander down a broad-arch gallery,
Viewing the scenes from life on either side,
Pressed forward with the force of years to see
But part of every picture when espied.
The big sun in its blue dome keeps its course,
Without a falter moves upon its way.
So human life, returning to its source,
Is overtaken by the close of day.
To dream, and being rudely waked from thought,
Return to peaceful dreaming dearly bought."
To a Daisy,"Slight as thou art, thou art enough to hide,
Like all created things, secrets from me,
And stand a barrier to eternity.
And I, how can I praise thee well and wide
From where I dwell—upon the hither side?
Thou little veil for so great mystery,
When shall I penetrate all things and thee,
And then look back? For this I must abide,
Till thou shalt grow and fold and be unfurled
Literally between me and the world.
Then shall I drink from in beneath a spring,
And from a poet’s side shall read his book.
O daisy mine, what will it be to look
From God’s side even of such a simple thing?"
The Moon Is in Labor,"At least she’s pretending to be,
in sisterly solidarity.
It’s not a joke, but the whole
world’s taking it badly. Meanwhile
I sit here pretending to be a flame 
in a thrown bottle. I pretend
that curved horns grow out of my ears 
when I hear of injustices. And 
meanwhile like the faint cigar 
lights of the darkened 
lounges where world leaders 
fraternize, the moon’s light glows
then fades. Her labor proves to be, 
well, laborious. Mine was too,
although this poem burst forth 
from my brain like a boot
or a god: furious."
A Monstrous Catalpa Tree Grows from a Drain,"You say your sunflowers are fifteen feet tall? 
This Catalpa is thirty feet, higher than the house. 
Soon the burdock and bitter dock will bury us in green. 
Our city feeds on jungle leaves the size of elephant ears.
The Catalpa pods hang, enormous dangling beans.
The Catalpa Tree does not enrich, nor does 
the monstrous burdock, be it bitter or curled. 
We laughed at how the Catalpa eats men and cats.
How its cheap matter foams at dusk to harden overnight. 
The Catalpa feeds on wormseed oil and nightshade flower-shine. 
The Catalpa Tree’s leaves smother and its dagger-beans stab. 
Hundreds of pods hang in clumps over our heads.
Not to notice is worrisome, as one man moved once into the green 
through a side door, his skull pierced 
as he entered the Catalpa’s spacious mansion
of enormous rooms, some spired and domed, some
small and smoky like cities across an oily river.
You will find platforms where one can view new stars.
If you climb high, you can hear the long wind 
since each is a stream pulled from one overarching wind.
The Catalpa Tree sprawls through the grate,
growing overnight, from sidewalk to sun tower.
Picked, the beans turn black, as the tree’s leaves shrink to pea green, 
the pallor of the ripe stiff putrefying by the chain-link. "
Snail-Picking,"The weatherman reports rain
to a crew of snail-pickers through an old TV.
They stand on the elevated porch,
holding plastic buckets and torches,
preparing for the long walk.
Behind the houses, on the football field,
blades of grass will soon wet.
The snail-pickers know this.
They walk onward
through the field for snails,
witnessing the vanishing of human voices.
Absolute stillness abounds.
The owl and bats on the succulent stalks,
the rubbish and snails,
within a few meters of a dead mouse.
Now, at the center, they fade
into a singularity: one man and one woman
to a section, torching for the hard,
brown shells. The young beams
reveal the slimy trails.
One snail picked up.
It could take minutes
to find another. Even hours.
They search, reducing their voices.
Attempting to fool the boy in the field,
they retreat into the night, slowly, leaving
him with the task of searching.
The cloudy sky strengthens
the discordant dialects of the frogs
and crickets. A rustle in a thicket.
The sudden realization
he’s alone with nature’s tricks.
In almost harmony with the owl’s screech,
the stems swish again."
Holocene Sonnet,"i)         The bloom—the pretty part we want—is
ii)        often how a threatened plant screams help. 
iii)       Venus flytraps can be sedated.  
iv)       Therefore, they can wake & be made calm.  
v)        Lice hatch ravenous for blood & claw

xiv)     to eat them alive, thigh by thigh."
Description of Symptoms,"Now my hands buried 
in my hair, resting on piano keys       
in the back of my head.
This is the music I am playing
through my mind: a dark room singing    
a song that will not have children. 
*
Lying on the floor tonight, snowflakes 
cut from paper laid over my eyes, a hand
carved from wood laid over my mouth. 
If the truth is the thing you must not say,
I will speak for the vase now
as it falls: it is better never
to be at all.                                                              
                              
*
A hand on the back of my head
made of glass, my love, my eyes,
filled with wire, life. Once
I watched a bird’s shadow cross a field 
in the wind: a black hat that could not stop 
tumbling. My eyes are sore
from seeing, my lips from speaking.
*
How a ribbon curls when pulled 
across a scissor’s blade, I am practicing 
transformation, pain. How the dark hair
of imagination, uncut, grows down
to the floor. What is left 
but to make a world, a war?                                
                                                                                     
*
Or a landscape in which to stay alive
(ghost flower/house of breath). Another wish: language
drilled through ice, through my life. 
If grief is love with nowhere to go, this is
my mouth turning into snow.
This is somewhere."
Rain Fugue,"Slanting, driving, Summer rain
How you wash my heart of pain!
How you make me think of trees,
Ships and gulls and flashing seas!
In your furious, tearing wind,
Swells a chant that heals my mind;
And your passion high and proud,
Makes me shout and laugh aloud!
Autumn rains that start at dawn,
“Dropping veils of thinnest lawn,”
Soaking sod between dank grasses,
Sweeping golden leaves in masses,—
Blotting, blurring out the Past,
In a dream you hold me fast;
Calling, coaxing to forget
Things that are, for things not yet.
Winter tempest, winter rain,
Hurtling down with might and main,
You but make me hug my hearth,
Laughing, sheltered from your wrath.
Now I woo my dancing fire,
Piling, piling drift-wood higher.
Books and friends and pictures old,
Hearten while you pound and scold!
Pattering, wistful showers of Spring
Set me to remembering
Far-off times and lovers too,
Gentle joys and heart-break rue,—
Memories I’d as lief forget,
Were not oblivion sadder yet.
Ah! you twist my mind with pain,
Wistful, whispering April rain!
Summer, Autumn, Winter rain,
How you ease my heart of pain!
Whispering, wistful showers of Spring,
How I love the hurt you bring!"
Dance,"Down at the hall at midnight sometimes,
You hear them singing rhymes.
These girls are dancing with boys.
They are too big for toys."
The Little Dandelion,"The dandelion stares
In the yellow sunlight.
How very still it is!
When it is old and grey,
I blow its white hair away,
And leave it with a bald head."
The Stream,"It was running down to the great Atlantic.
I called it back to me,
But it slyly looked and said,
“I have not time to waste,”
And just went arunning running on."
Robin Red Breast,"Little Robin red breast,
I hear you sing your song.
I would love to have you put it into my little cage,
Into my little mouth."
Have You Ever Seen It?,"Have you ever seen the moon
And stars stick together?
Have you ever seen it?
Have you ever seen bad?
Have you ever seen good
And bad stick together?
Have you ever seen it?"
Me Alone,"As I was going to town,
I saw a King and a Queen.
Such ringing of bells you never heard,
The clerks ran out of the stores;
You know how it was, Me alone.
I was standing as the others were,
“Oh! you little girl,” some one said,
“The King wants you,”
I became frightened
Wondering what he had to say,
Me alone.
Here’s what he wanted:
He wanted me to ride in his coach,
I felt myself so much riding in a King’s coach,
Me alone."
Baby Cobina,"Brown Baby Cobina, with his large black velvet eyes,
His little coos of ecstasies, his gurgling of surprise,
With brass bells on his ankles, that laugh where’er he goes;
It’s so rare for bells to tinkle, above brown dimpled toes.

Brown Baby Cobina is so precious that we fear
Something might come and steal him, when we grownups are not near;
So we tied bells on his ankles, and kissed on them this charm—
“Bell, guard our Baby Cobina from all devils and all harm.”"
The Serving Girl,"The calabash wherein she served my food,
Was smooth and polished as sandalwood:
Fish, as white as the foam of the sea,
Peppered, and golden fried for me.
She brought palm wine that carelessly slips
From the sleeping palm tree’s honeyed lips.
But who can guess, or even surmise
The countless things she served with her eyes?"
Rainy Season Love Song,"Out of the tense awed darkness, my Frangepani comes;
Whilst the blades of Heaven flash round her, and the roll of thunder drums
My young heart leaps and dances, with exquisite joy and pain,
As storms within and storms without I meet my love in the rain.

“The rain is in love with you darling; it’s kissing you everywhere,
Rain pattering over your small brown feet, rain in your curly hair;
Rain in the vale that your twin breasts make, as in delicate mounds they rise,
I hope there is rain in your heart, Frangepani, as rain half fills your eyes.”

Into my hands she cometh, and the lightning of my desire
Flashes and leaps about her, more subtle than Heaven’s fire;
“The lightning’s in love with you darling; it is loving you so much,
That its warm electricity in you pulses wherever I may touch.
When I kiss your lips and your eyes, and your hands like twin flowers apart,
I know there is lightning, Frangepani, deep in the depths of your heart.”

The thunder rumbles about us, and I feel its triumphant note
As your warm arms steal around me; and I kiss your dusky throat;
“The thunder’s in love with you darling.   It hides its power in your breast.
And I feel it stealing o’er me as I lie in your arms at rest.
I sometimes wonder, beloved, when I drink from life’s proffered bowl,
Whether there’s thunder hidden in the innermost parts of your soul.”

Out of my arms she stealeth; and I am left alone with the night,
Void of all sounds save peace, the first faint glimmer of light.
Into the quiet, hushed stillness my Frangepani goes.
Is there peace within like the peace without?   Only the darkness knows."
Nativity,"Within a native hut, ere stirred the dawn,
Unto the Pure One was an Infant born
Wrapped in blue lappah that his mother dyed.
Laid on his father’s home-tanned deer-skin hide
The babe still slept by all things glorified.
Spirits of black bards burst their bonds and sang,
“Peace upon earth” until the heavens rang.
All the black babies who from earth had fled,
Peeped through the clouds, then gathered round His
            head.
Telling of things a baby needs to do,
When first he opens his eyes on wonders new;
Telling Him that to sleep was sweeter rest,
All comfort came from His black mother’s breast.
Their gifts were of Love caught from the springing sod,
Whilst tears and laughter were the gifts of God.
Then all the wis men of the past stood forth
Filling the air East, West, and South and North;
And told him of the joys that wisdom brings
To mortals in their earthly wanderings.
The children of the past shook down each bough,
Wreathed Frangepani blossoms for His brow;
They put pink lilies in His mother’s hand,
And heaped for both the first fruits of the land.
His father cut some palm fronds that the air
Be coaxed to zephyrs while He rested there.
Birds trilled their hallelujahs; and the dew
Trembled with laughter till the babe laughed too.
All the black women brought their love so wise,
And kissed their motherhood into his mother’s eyes."
Prisms,"What is beheld through glass seems glass.
The quality of what I am
Encases what I am not,
Smooths the strange world.
I perceive it slowly
In my time,
In my material,
As my pride,
As my possession:
The vision is love.
When life crashes like a cracked pane,
Still shall I love
Even the slight grass and the patient dust.
Death also sees, though darkly,
And I must trust then as now
Only another kind of prism
Through which I may not put my hands to touch."
Palm Springs,"We drink Fernet by ironic sculptures
under misters that make our bangs damp.
It’s our anniversary, 
though that time feels faint.
We are searching for a place
to escape his diagnosis,
laws against gay marriage,
our leaky, flat roof.
Every Memorial Day 
and Labor Day, we go to the desert.
Sometimes also the Fourth 
of July.
Palm Springs rewinds things.
We almost buy that mid-century chair
proud of our rule that love for it 
needs to be immediate.
At the Parker, a guy with a calf tattoo 
brings drinks. 
You can ask for anything here.
We toast to another year without cancer.
After dinner, we wander the hotel hedge maze,
nowhere to go that late but home."
Lamb,"I had a lamb I brought everywhere
who only had one eye.
At the train stations,
all the grown-ups would say, be mindful
of your things, little boy,
someone will steal right out of your pocket
or take the watch off your wrist.
My dad had a beautiful overcoat.
The lamb’s white fur got smudged.
My brother was a baby,
and in the restaurants,
the old waiters would pick him up
and kiss him again and again on the cheek
with their mustaches
and tell my parents
that they promised they would bring him back in a minute
but now they needed to show the chef.
I don’t remember when the eye became unglued
and who knows where it went.
On long train rides,
I remember falling asleep,
putting my finger in the hole where it used to be.
Once he had to go in an overhead bin,
and he was freezing when I kissed him again."
Sissy,"I can’t remember my dad calling me a sissy,
but he definitely told me not to be a sissy.
I secretly (or not so secretly) liked all the sissy
things. We had a hunting dog named Sissy.
Really: Sissy. My father nicknamed my sister: Sissy.
Still, he says, “How’s Sissy?” and calls her Sissy
when she goes home to visit him. Belinda (Sissy)
is one of the toughest people I know. My sissy
(sister) has kicked someone’s ass, which isn’t sissy-
ish, I guess, though I want to redefine sissy
into something fabulous, tough, tender, “sissy-
tough.” Drag queens are damn tough and sissies.
I’m pretty fucking tough and a big, big sissy,
too. And kind. Tough and kind and happy: a sissy."
Ode to Black Air Forces,"Praise to the obsidian sole, which kisses the glass-
coated asphalt before becoming airborne. Praise 
to the black tongue, camouflaged, yet still 
flashing a warning of give no shit. Praise to the 
magic of ones turned two-piece, left and right 
feet a pair of wingmen to all that is fair in love. 
Original uniform of the fighter, multi-mission, 
robbin’ hoodies from designer shops to redistribute 
wealth. Praise to the weave of your vamp poised 
to catch flight into ribs at night, at noon, 
whenever. Praise to the aight whatever, 
aight bet, spoken wordlessly via emblem, 
prophecy of manual dexterity, long rumored
tale of ten toes down come true. Praise to 
your run through rap charts, Nelly who sang
of your stomp and survival, to 1982
the year of your birth, your absorption of
pressure waves from apartheid bombings,
Tough, by Kurtis Blow rerouted into
the democratization of dark energy. Ode to 
your essence making up 73% of the cosmos,
the power of 310 Angola aircraft in a single heel, 
to each uptown caressing a possible president,
to a force beyond force = mass x acceleration.
Fast lil ma working behind the cash register. 
On the way home she passes home. 
Ode to what you gave her, what you give her, 
wherever she’s going."
[Like a white stone],"Translated from the Russian by Babette Deutsch and Avrahm Yarmolinsky
Like a white stone deep in a draw-well lying,
As hard and clear, a memory lies in me.
I cannot strive nor have I heart for striving:
It is such pain and yet such ecstasy.
It seems to me that someone looking closely
Into my eyes would see it, patent, pale.
And, seeing, would grow sadder and more thoughtful
Than one who listens to a bitter tale.
The ancient gods changed men to things, but left them
A consciousness that smoldered endlessly,
That splendid sorrows might endure forever.
And you are changed into a memory.
    [Как белый камень в глубине колодца,]
  Как белый камень в глубине колодца,
Лежит во мне одно воспоминанье.
Я не могу и не хочу бороться:
Оно—веселье и оно—страданье.
Мне кажется, что тот, кто близко взглянет
В мои глаза, его увидит сразу.
Печальней и задумчивее станет
Внимающего скорбному рассказу.
Я ведаю, что боги превращали
Людей в предметы, не убив сознанья,
Чтоб вечно жили дивные печали.
Ты превращён в моё воспоминанье."
Make Love to Me Like We’ve Never Known Violence,"Like every leaving wasn’t a country
that seceded from your body
Like every lover wasn’t crossing
your wrists in trouble’s rolling light
Make love to me like your people were never
stolen, like your blood has never been a question
of belonging. And I will make
love to you like a river unbraiding
our countries, like the mind of the ocean
remembering your name."
Preparing for Residential Placement for My Disabled Daughter,"My life without you—I have already
seen it. Today, on the salt marsh. 
The red-winged blackbird perched 
in the tallest tree, sage green branches
falling over the water. She sat there
for a long time, doing nothing.
As she lifted up to fly, the slender branch
shook from the release of her weight.
When the bird departed, it seemed
the branch would shake forever
in the wind, bobbing up and down.
When it finally stopped moving,
the branch was diminished,
reaching out to the vast sky."
Magalu,"Summer comes.
The ziczac hovers
’Round the greedy-mouthed crocodile.
A vulture bears away a foolish jackal.
The flamingo is a dash of pink
Against dark green mangroves,
Her slender legs rivalling her slim neck.
The laughing lake gurgles delicious music in its throat
And lulls to sleep the lazy lizard,
A nebulous being on a sun-scorched rock.
In such a place,
In this pulsing, riotous gasp of color,
I met Magalu, dark as a tree at night,
Eager-lipped, listening to a man with a white collar
And a small black book with a cross on it.
Oh Magalu, come! Take my hand and I will read you poetry,
Chromatic words,
Seraphic symphonies,
Fill up your throat with laughter and your heart with song.
Do not let him lure you from your laughing waters,
Lulling lakes, lissome winds.
Would you sell the colors of your sunset and the fragrance
Of your flowers, and the passionate wonder of your forest
For a creed that will not let you dance?"
Poem,"Little brown boy,
Slim, dark, big-eyed,
Crooning love songs to your banjo
Down at the Lafayette—
Gee, boy, I love the way you hold your head,
High sort of and a bit to one side,
Like a prince, a jazz prince. And I love
Your eyes flashing, and your hands,
And your patent-leathered feet,
And your shoulders jerking the jig-wa.
And I love your teeth flashing,
And the way your hair shines in the spotlight
Like it was the real stuff.
Gee, brown boy, I loves you all over.
I’m glad I’m a jig. I’m glad I can
Understand your dancin’ and your
Singin’, and feel all the happiness
And joy and don’t care in you.
Gee, boy, when you sing, I can close my ears
And hear tom toms just as plain.
Listen to me, will you, what do I know
About tom toms? But I like the word, sort of,
Don’t you? It belongs to us.
Gee, boy, I love the way you hold your head,
And the way you sing, and dance,
And everything.
Say, I think you’re wonderful. You’re
Allright with me,
You are."
To the Friend Who Is Crying on the Phone,"For Muriel
Once, a man I thought I
loved assumed love was a thing bound
to the future, an obligation that lay
ahead rather than the rarest swelling now

& he said when I think of the future
I have to admit there is not future
& while I’m sure he meant to say “no
future” the not made his statement Boolean,

the future as true or false rather than less possible
& more possible, & that is also the difference
between time & space, god & the devil, matter
& antimatter, heaven & the counterpart

to heaven, all of them theories
of love. In pitch dark it comes: faith
is a feeling rooted in hopelessness. & so I refuse
a world cut into brutal black

& white halves when all god
has ever been is a field imagining
itself, an infinite grey coast forming
morning color; how a woman left

for dead will fist a root from the bank
& pull herself out of the river;
like the baby born in a bomb
shelter between nations; or the elder

remembering the original names of time;
like a scorpion overcoming his
nature to cross the water on faith alone—
this too is love:

The crane that surrenders to winter’s last
light. To accept the not future
as another kind of now, and hold in
the tide that tosses & swells & swells

& swells yearning to reach the edge
of a cliffside that was once a low coast
at the beginning of the world; the letting go
is easier when even the sea must dream its mirror;

& when time starts over, the future will be behind us but
love, like god, will still be here
       "
In Imitation of Horace,"                                I
What mean those Amorous Curles of Jet?
      For what heart-Ravisht Maid
Dost thou thy Hair in order set,
      Thy Wanton Tresses Braid?
And thy vast Store of Beauties open lay,
That the deluded Fancy leads astray.
                                II
For pitty hide thy Starry eyes,
      Whose Languishments destroy:
And look not on the Slave that dyes
      With an Excess of Joy.
Defend thy Coral Lips, thy Amber Breath;
To taste these Sweets lets in a Certain Death.
                                III
Forbear, fond Charming Youth, forbear,
      Thy words of Melting Love:
Thy Eyes thy Language well may spare,
      One Dart enough can move.
And she that hears thy voice and sees thy Eyes
With too much Pleasure, too much Softness dies.
                                IV
Cease, Cease, with Sighs to warm my Soul,
      Or press me with thy Hand:
Who can the kindling fire controul,
      The tender force withstand?
Thy Sighs and Touches like wing’d Lightning fly,
And are the Gods of Loves Artillery.
    Carminum Liber Primus, Ode Quintus
  Quis multa gracilis te puer in rosa

Simplex munditiis? Heu! quotiens fidem  
Mutatosque Deos flebit, et aspera
      Nigris aequora ventis
         Emirabitur insolens,
Qui nunc te fruitur credulus aurea;
Qui semper vacuam, semper amabilem

The Broken English Dream,"It was the night
before the welfare check
and everybody sat around the table
hungry heartbroken cold confused
and unable to heal the wounds
on the dead calendar of our eyes
Old newspapers and empty beer cans
and jesus is the master of this house
Picture frames made in japan by the u.s.
was hanging out in the kitchen
which was also the livingroom
the bedroom and the linen closet
Wall to wall bad news was playing
over the radio that last week was stolen
by dying dope addicts looking for a fix
to forget that they were ever born
The slumlord came with hand grenades
in his bad breath to collect the rent
we were unable to pay six month ago
and inform us and all the empty
shopping bags we own that unless
we pay we will be evicted immediately
And the streets where the night lives
and the temperature is below zero
three hundred sixty-five days a year
will become our next home address
All the lightbulbs of our apartment
were left and forgotten at the pawnshop
across the street from the heart attack 
the broken back buildings were having
Infants not born yet played hide n seek
in the cemetery of their imagination
Blind in the mind tenants were praying
for numbers to hit so they can move out
and wake up with new birth certificates
The grocery stores were outnumbered by
funeral parlors with neon signs that said
Customers wanted No experience necessary
A liquor store here and a liquor store
everywhere you looked filled the polluted
air with on the job training prostitutes
pimps and winos and thieves and abortions
White business store owners from clean-cut
plush push-button neat neighborhoods
who learn how to speak spanish in six weeks
wrote love letters to their cash registers
Vote for me! said the undertaker: I am
the man with the solution to your problems
To the united states we came
To learn how to mispell our name
To lose the definition of pride
To have misfortune on our side
To live where rats and roaches roam
in a house that is definitely not a home
To be trained to turn on television sets
To dream about jobs you will never get
To fill out welfare applications
To graduate from school without an education
To be drafted distorted and destroyed
To work full time and still be unemployed 
To wait for income tax returns
and stay drunk and lose concern
for the heart and soul of our race
and the climate that produce our face 
To pledge allegiance
to the flag
of the united states
of installment plans
One nation
under discrimination
for which it stands
and which it falls
with poverty injustice
and televised
firing squads
for everyone who has
the sun on the side
of their complexion

the two-engine airplane
at idlewild airport

We follow the sign

but keep your hands
off the property
violators will be electrocuted
follow the garbage truck

So this is america
land of the free
for everybody
but our family
So this is america
where you wake up
in the morning
to brush your teeth
with the home relief
the leading toothpaste

promise you you will get
every time you buy
a box of cornflakes 
on the lay-away plan
So this is america
land of the free
to watch the

somebody who owns a set
that works properly
So this is america
exploited by columbus

with captain video

the first miss subways
in the new testament
So this is america
where they keep you
busy singing

Letters Found Near a Suicide,"To all of you
      My little stone
      Sinks quickly
      Into the bosom of this deep, dark pool
      Of oblivion . . .
      I have troubled its breast but little
      Yet those far shores
      That knew me not
      Will feel the fleeting, furtive kiss
      Of my time concentric ripples . . .
To Lewellyn
      You have borne full well
      The burden of my friendship—
      I have drunk deep
      At your crystal pool,
      And in return
      I have polluted its waters
      With the bile of my hatred.
      I have flooded your soul
      With tortuous thoughts,
      I have played Iscariot
      To your Pythias . . .
To Mother
      I came
      In the blinding sweep
      Of ecstatic pain,
      I go
      In the throbbing pulse
      Of aching space—
      In the eons between
      I piled upon you
      Pain on pain
      Ache on ache
      And yet as I go
      I shall know
      That you will grieve
      And want me back . . .
To B——
      You have freed me—
      In opening wide the doors
      Of flesh
      You have freed me
      Of the binding leash.
      I have climbed the heights
      Of white disaster
      My body screaming
      In the silver crash of passion . . .
      Before you gave yourself
      To him
      I had chained myself
      For you.
      But when at last
      You lowered your proud flag
      In surrender complete
      You gave me too, as hostage—
      And I have wept my joy
      At the dawn-tipped shrine
      Of many breasts.
To Jean
      When you poured your love
      Like molten flame
      Into the throbbing mold
      Of her pulsing veins
      Leaving her blood a river of fire
      And her arteries channels of light,
      I hated you . . .
      Hated with the primal hate
      That has its wells
      In the flesh of me
      And the flesh of you
      And the flesh of her
      I hated you—
      Hated with envy
      Your mastery of her being . . .
      With one fleshy gesture
      You pricked the iridescent bubble
      Of my dreams
      And so to make
      Your conquest more sweet
      I tell you now
      That I hated you.
To Catalina
      Love thy piano, Oh girl,
      It will give you back
      Note for note
      The harmonies of your soul.
      It will sing back to you
      The high songs of your heart.
      It will give
      As well as take . . .
To Mariette
      I sought consolation
      In the sorrow of your eyes.
      You sought reguerdon
      In the crying of my heart . . .
      We found that shattered dreamers
      Can be bitter hosts . . .
To ——
      You call it
      Death of the Spirit
      And I call it Life . . .
      The vigor of vibration,
      The muffled knocks,
      the silver sheen of passion's flood,
      The ecstasy of pain . . .
      You call it
      Death of the Spirit
      And I call it Life.
To Telie
      You have made my voice
      A rippling laugh
      But my heart
      A crying thing . . .
      ’Tis better thus:
      A fleeting kiss
      And then,
      The dark . . .
To “Chick”
      Oh Achilles of the moleskins
      And the gridiron
      Do not wonder
      Nor doubt that this is I
      That lies so calmly here—
      This is the same exultant beast
      That so joyously
      Ran the ball with you
      In those far flung days of abandon.
      You remember how recklessly
      We revelled in the heat and the dust
      And the swirl of conflict?
      You remember they called us
      The Terrible Two?
      And you remember
      After we had battered our heads
      And our bodies
      Against the stonewall of their defense,—
      You remember the signal I would call
      And how you would look at me
      In faith and admiration
      And say “Let's go,” . . .
      How the lines would clash
      And strain,
      And how I would slip through
      Fighting and squirming
      Over the line
      To victory.
      You remember, Chick? . . .
      When you gaze at me here
      Let that same light
      Of faith and admiration
      Shine in your eyes
      For I have battered the stark stonewall
      Before me . . .
      I have kept faith with you
      And now
      I have called my signal,
      Found my opening
      And slipped through
      Fighting and squirming
      Over the line
      To victory . . .
To Wanda
      To you, so far away
      So cold and aloof,
      To you, who knew me so well,
      This is my last Grand Gesture
      This is my last Great Effect
      And as I go winging
      Through the black doors of eternity
      Is that thin sound I hear
      Your applause? . . ."
Negro Woman,"The sky hangs heavy tonight
Like the hair of a Negro woman.
The scars of the moon are curved
Like the wrinkles on the brow of a Negro woman.
The stars twinkle tonight
Like the glaze in a Negro woman’s eyes,
Drinking the tears set flowing by an aging hurt
Gnawing at her heart.
The earth trembles tonight
Like the quiver of a Negro woman’s eye-lids cupping tears."
Africa,"Thou art not dead, although the spoiler’s hand
Lies heavy as death upon thee; though the wrath
Of its accursed might is in thy path
And has usurped thy children of their land;
Though yet the scourges of a monstrous band
Roam on thy ruined fields, thy trampled lanes,
Thy ravaged homes and desolated fanes;
Thou art not dead, but sleeping,—Motherland.
A mighty country, valorous and free,
Thou shalt outlive this terror and this pain;
Shall call thy scattered children back to thee,
Strong with the memory of their brothers slain;
And rise from out thy charnel house to be
Thine own immortal, brilliant self again!"
Transformation,"I return the bitterness,
   Which you gave to me;
When I wanted loveliness
   Tantalant and free.
I return the bitterness
   It is washed by tears;
Now it is a loveliness
   Garnished through the years.
I return it loveliness,
   Having made it so;
For I wore the bitterness
   From it long ago."
What Do I Care for Morning,"What do I care for morning,
For a shivering aspen tree,
For sun flowers and sumac
Opening greedily?
What do I care for morning,
For the glare of the rising sun,
For a sparrow’s noisy prating,
For another day begun?
Give me the beauty of evening,
The cool consummation of night,
And the moon like a love-sick lady,
Listless and wan and white.
Give me a little valley
Huddled beside a hill,
Like a monk in a monastery,
Safe and contented and still,
Give me the white road glistening,
A strand of the pale moon’s hair,
And the tall hemlocks towering
Dark as the moon is fair.
Oh what do I care for morning,
Naked and newly born—
Night is here, yielding and tender—
What do I care for dawn!"

A Lesson from my Father about Electricity,"When I wait 
for my father, the stars 
disappear. Only bats 
dart and flutter, 
hungry for the hum 
of mosquitos, thick 
as honey. Their bright 
sting lingers and jumps
like electricity can.
It’s looking for a body.
He didn’t say  
how production
stopped when the volt
distribution panel was
cleaned of calf and hip.
No matter how hot
the summer was, my father
said it was nothing compared
to coke, spelled coal. The way it
penetrated his skin like the breathlessness of asphalt
and the charcoal briquettes he set fire to—
the sizzle and curl of chicken skin
rubbed with paprika, salt, and black pepper.
The acrid spray of vinegar when turned and sealed 
under lid. I stood next to the heat, 
a sticky sheen of smoke,
and I wanted to eat."
Mexican Heaven,"forget heaven & its promises of gold—
everything we make on this planet
has one purpose. every poem, every act
of photosynthesis, every protest. if heaven
is real, then its gates are closed to us. maybe
heaven is just a museum of all the life
we have extincted. we are death
machines building death machines. in life
we are useless to stop death. in death, we arrive
at god’s house—only to find god torturing dolls.
we wanted to be made in god’s image—we imagined
gold & not the melting that gold requires. "
Maybach Music (with a sample from Paul Wall),"if the rich want payment, they can get in line—
i’m always going to pay myself first

i’ve been rent due & payday missing.
that never stopped me from dancing,
hands in the air bouncing to the bass
of my favorite rapper’s favorite lies.
let me take that back, i don’t know
who lies & who tells the truth,
but on my tongue every rap is a lie.
still i skip the corner store toilet paper
for the triple-ply deluxe rolls. the rich
believe only they deserve soft asses.

Dirk McDermott,"Fellow Scout who could climb and touch 
the gold ball at the top of the flagpole, 
and do math three grades ahead 
under his crewcut. I need a calculator 
to figure how long since I spoke his name.
How long since I offered my own blue
neckerchief to wipe his always runny nose.
But last night in smoke, steam, and rain
beside a wrecked train I told him how happy 
I felt in the igloo we’d built, how handsome 
a cub he’d been crawling on all fours
up the twilit tunnel to me. In a hoarse 
whisper and never looking at his face."
"Summer, You’re a Boneyard","and you used to be The Richard Bey Show 
and my sister’s spaghetti. Under a friar plum tree, 
a simplified reading of “The Argonautica.”
You kept me full and entertained. I was that kind 
of round child. Gorging on what was left over. 
I didn’t want a real burden, my own ship or story. 
I didn’t want to go on ahead. I didn’t want to 
have to reverse into you. Into your apparatus. 
I never wanted nostalgia. We used to know each other,
remember? Dry. Humid. Dry. Humid. 
Not. Humid. Dry. Humid. Dry. Humid. Dry.
Why did we have to pry open our patch of dirt? 
Why couldn’t you always be acid wash
or those I CAN’T DRIVE 55 posters at the swap meet

you. What if he takes another this year? What if 
he’s difficult to talk my way out of? What if he eats me 
only half-alive? What if all he is in his beach bum
orange is ghosts clothespinned to the laundry line?"
The Honest Tongue,"Avoiding the stockade 
and bastioned gate

over the site of the gallows,
estuary cattails pierce a lacy mimic
of the fort’s dark piked palisades. 
Red winged blackbirds harry 
a great blue heron who flies 
with a shiver of cracked 
eggshells slipping from its beak. 
Some languages 
reverse past and present, 
with sun and moon,
black lined days on the calendar, 
and the wristwatch’s ticking goad
all coiled at the root.

takes its name first from 
its people then perhaps 
from the delicate mauve blooms

I Grant You Ample Leave,"                              “I grant you ample leave
To use the hoary formula ‘I am’
Naming the emptiness where thought is not;
But fill the void with definition, ‘I’
Will be no more a datum than the words
You link false inference with, the ‘Since’ & ‘so’
That, true or not, make up the atom-whirl.
Resolve your ‘Ego,’ it is all one web
With vibrant ether clotted into worlds:
Your subject, self, or self-assertive ‘I’
Turns nought but object, melts to molecules,
Is stripped from naked Being with the rest
Of those rag-garments named the Universe.
Or if, in strife to keep your ‘Ego’ strong
You make it weaver of the etherial light,
Space, motion, solids & the dream of Time—
Why, still ’tis Being looking from the dark,
The core, the centre of your consciousness,
That notes your bubble-world: sense, pleasure, pain,
What are they but a shifting otherness,
Phantasmal flux of moments?—”"

Where does she get off upstaging me?

Look,"The dead are breathing inside me now,
everything slowing to the pace of the newt
crawling across the bricks, the old cat watching,
the newt too slow for even him
as the crack in the earth opens and the roots
rise up to trip me. Fire lives in me
and the fear of fire, plague and the fear
of plague, death and the fear of death
though only it will silence me. I remember
the abandoned freight cars
standing on unused tracks, doors open.
I saw through them to the stubbled fields
beyond. The owl sitting on its fencepost late
in the day, the creek and its flowing,
the pied horse in its pasture—I was afraid
I’d lose them. If I could only do just this,
the long days filled, me longing, in pursuit
of something exquisite that eludes me, always
clumsy, never knowing the manners
of the place I have entered."
"Hey,","With the intention of abandoning the hierarchies of capitalism—
The machinery of thought. Hey, with the desire of growing lilacs
In our community garden, bougainvillea running along the wall. 
Hey, as we denounce the walls of isolation and marginalization.
No, to the elite. No, to centuries of settler colonialism,
Their insistence, we are immigrants on our own land.
Hey, at midnight, beneath the candle of the moon: our arms
Interlocked like laurels painted onto the rims of renaissance paintings.
Hey, I miss you. I never even met you: let’s take a deep dive
Into each other’s bookshelves, until we find oceans of imagery
And metaphors we can discuss, dissect, not for ego’s sake, but for love."

A common rubric.

   Our hope, through the long vistaed years, a sight
Of that our Captain’s soul sees face to face.
   Who, faithless, faltering that the road is steep,
Now raiseth up his drear insistent cry?
   Who stoppeth here to spend a while in sleep
Or curseth that the storm obscures the sky?
   Heed not the darkness round you, dull and deep;
The clouds grow thickest when the summit’s nigh."
For a Student Who Used AI to Write a Paper,"Now I let it fall back
in the grasses.
I hear you. I know
this life is hard now.
I know your days are precious
on this earth.
But what are you trying
to be free of?
The living? The miraculous
task of it?
Love is for the ones who love the work."
To A Certain Woman," I see in your eyes
    Black diamonds
                   Of Hindustan
    Figure silks
                   Of Lahore
    Scarlet flames
                   Of Fuji-Yama
    And the flames are there
                   Brightness
    The figured silks there
                   Dusk
    The black diamonds there
                   Colour
 I see in your heart
    Yellow cobras
                   Of Burma
    Deadly fungi
                   Of Bengal
    Poison flowers
                   Of Nepal
    And the poison flowers
                   Are your vows
    The deadly fungi
                   Your kisses
    The yellow cobras
                  Your deceits"
Paean,"Across the dewy lawn she treads
    Before the sun awakes
While lush, green grasses bow their heads
    To kiss the tracks she makes.

The violets, in clusters, stand
    And stare her beauty through,
And seem so happy in her hand,
    They know not what to do.

She must have come whence zephyrs blow,
    From sprites’ or angels’ lands;
Her heart is meet for God to know—
    Oh, heaven is where she stands!"
The Last Quarter Moon of the Dying Year,"The last quarter moon of the dying year,
Pendant behind a naked cottonwood tree
On a frosty, dawning morning
With the back of her silver head
Turned to the waking sun.
Quiet like the waters
Of Galilee
After the Lord had bid them
“Peace, be still.”
O silent beauty, indescribable!
Dead, do they say?
Would God that I shall seem
So beautiful in death."
After All,"After all and after all
When the song is sung
And swallowed up in silence
It were more real unsung. . . .
After all and after all
When the lips have stirred
Such a little of the thought
Is transmuted in the word. . . . . .
Suffer not my ears with hearing
Suffer not your thoughts with speech.
Let us feel into our meaning
And thus know the all of each."
Nocturne,"Softly blow lightly
O twilight breeze
Scarcely bend slightly
O silver trees:
Night glides slowly down hill . . down stream
Bringing a myriad star-twinkling dream. . . . .
Softly blow lightly
O twilight breeze
Scarcely bend slightly
O silver trees:
Night will spill sleep in your day weary eye
While a soft yellow moon steals down the sky. . . .
Softly blow
Scarcely bend
So . . . . !
Lullaby. . . . . . . ."
Confession,"She kneeled before me begging
    That I should with a prayer
Give her absolution
    (How golden was her hair!)

She begged an absolution
    While the moments fled
She thought my tears were pity
    (My soul her lips were red!)

She begged of me forgiveness
    God you understand
(For pale and soft and slender
    Was her dainty hand!)

She begged that I should pray You
    That her Soul might rest
But I could not pray O Master
    (Ivory was her breast!)"
Night,"Night like purple flakes of snow
Falls with ease
Catching on the roofs of houses
In the tops of trees
Down upon the distant grass
And the distant flower
It will drift into this room
In an hour. . . . . . . . ."
Auf Wiedersehen,"I shall come this way again
    On some distant morrow
When the red and golden leaves
    Have fallen on my sorrow . . . !

I shall come this way again
    When this day is rotten
In the grave of yesterdays
    And this hour forgotten. . . . !

I shall come this way again
    Before the lamp light dies
To comfort you and dry the tear
    Of penance from your eyes. . . . !"
Inscription,"He wrote upon his heart
As on the door of some dark ancient house:
Who once lived here has long been dead
As dead as moss-grown stone
Only a ghost inhabits here
One that would be alone
Only a ghost inhabits here
A ghost without desire
Who sits before a shadowed hearth
And warms to a spectral fire. . . . . . ."
The Black Madonna,"Not as the white nations
    know thee
        O Mother!

But swarthy of cheek
    and full-lipped as the
        child races are.

Yet thou art she,
    the Immaculate Maid,
        and none other,

Crowned in the stable
    at Bethlehem,
        hailed of the star.

See where they come,
    thy people,
        so humbly appealing,

From the ancient lands
    where the olden faiths
        had birth.

Tired dusky hands
    uplifted for thy
        healing.

Pity them, Mother,
    the untaught
        of earth."
once the magnolia has blossomed,"     *
     Once the magnolia blossoms,
the descending shadow of the petals
stains the street
     with the brown footprint leaving,
where it has stepped in itself,
     a track
walked in its own being flesh
gone as to excrement —
     spring, in tomorrow’s rain, comes
a hose-down of the scene as
of an annual
                      murder,
the fallen   petal
     of a sparrow
no one had kept an eye on except
the peregrine
     from the Methodist church tower.
     A hose-down    as hope  
this has to do with something
about the plant cycle
     of sublime season done          not sacrifice
to some stoned possession   for blood
spent on the street,
     and so much lost    you’d think
beauty had left a lesson
     more   than more is there          to ask for."
October Sonnet,"—after Ted Berrigan
Even on the 13th floor of a high building, Chicago’s 
wind winds its slick way through any unsecured 
window on its singsong to the lake. It’s fine-tuned, 
perfectly pitched in this sinister season 
of cackling jack-o’-lanterns & candy corns 
nobody eats unless they’re the last sweets left.
Bags of fun nonsense for all the little ninjas 
& ghosts. It’s true, I weep too much when 
the seasons partition: snack-sized tears dropping onto 
tear-sized leaves swirling in the autumn 
of my reproduction. Occasional receipts & parking 
tickets, too, yellowed during their own windy migrations. 
Like the rest of us gusty apparitions, every 
untethered thing ends up at the lake shore seasonally. "
Neoteric Kama No Sutra,"When pheromones, ignited by the promise 
in her come-and-get-it smile, our kinetic skin, 
and my hunger, sing to our son of how he got here 
and why it all started, he finds a way to prove  
umbilical cords are longer than desire. 
He cries I just want you, and everything planned 
or selfish and hard, in her, melts and is put on hold.
Something in the ether, in the dark or in our eyes 
warns my mini me that another hymn could be made
in this moment. He remembers he does not share,
wedges his head into our groove, almost reprising 
his birth. Like a wrestler needing to break a figure-four
leg lock or spill the Milk and Water Embrace,
he forces a submission, but we    are patient    and wait."

   "
Boihood,"All I ever wanted to be was a song— 
something soft and light held in the mouth 
sung sweet beneath the coming dawn. 
I return to that first desire—its gingham blouse 
rubbed against the heavy pull of flesh hovered
in a dark that I can only recall as that dark.
I ask what grace awaits that tender tendril’s suffered
stretch of green wide enough to tear a stark 
light out from under a troubled sky? I return
to the center of that smallness and sing its wounds—
jagged rasp crooned until edged out and earned.
I was the only boi I knew dreaming in soft bruise. 
And it made me as beautiful as the blood’s slow sprawl
at my knee, right before punching a bullying boy to crawl."
Self-Care,"I begged the year for intimacy. Dashed down into my sheets
with nothing but the fan on. I begged my knees for oil, to bend
easy guillotine around some neck, maybe cut off the lamp in my belly, 
knock out the dust from my toes, sweep out the tricks webbing up my corneas.
I said give me back my wata and the sleep number started seizing
—put a hump in the hour—but no more. When I finally gave up, I went 
to the mirror for a look-see and found that bitch sucking face
with last winter when I’d come close to the Mojave’s affection
only to float on too quick and too far West. Seeing me she said something 
I can do for you? Shaking my head I let her go on, got me some 
coffee and went back to work feeding myself pretty lyrics and lead."
The Return,"                          I

Once more, listening to the wind and rain, 
Once more, you and I, and above the hurting sound
Of these comes back the throbbing of remembered rain, 
Treasured rain falling on dark ground. 
Once more, huddling birds upon the leaves
And summer trembling on a withered vine. 
And once more, returning out of pain, 
The friendly ghost that was your love and mind. 

                           II

Darkness brings the jungle to our room: 
The throb of rain is the throb of muffled drums. 
Darkness hangs our room with pendulums
Of vine and in the gathering gloom
Our walls recede into a denseness of 
Surrounding trees. This is a night of love 
Retained from those lost nights our fathers slept 
In huts; this is a night that must not die. 
Let us keep the dance of rain our fathers kept
And tread our dreams beneath the jungle sky. 

                        III

And now the downpour ceases. 
Let us go back once more upon the glimmering leaves 
And as the throbbing of the drums increases 
Shake the grass and dripping boughs of trees.
A dry wind stirs the palm; the old tree grieves. 

Time has charged the years: the old days have returned. 

Let us dance by metal waters burned 
With gold of moon, let us dance 
With naked feet beneath the young spice trees. 
What was that light, that radiance 
On your face?—something I saw when first 
You passed beneath the jungle tapestries?

A moment we pause to quench our thirst
Kneeling at the water’s edge, the gleam 
Upon your face is plain: you have wanted this. 
Let us go back and search the tangled dream 
And as the muffled drum-beats throb and miss
Remember again how early darkness comes 
To dreams and silence to the drums. 

                         IV 

Let us go back into the dusk again, 
Slow and sad-like following the track
Of blowing leaves and cool white rain
Into the old gray dream, let us go back. 
Our walls close about us we lie and listen 
To the noise of the street, the storm and the driven birds. 
A question shapes your lips, your eyes glisten 
Retaining tears, but there are no more words. "
To a Young Girl Leaving the Hill Country,"The hills are wroth; the stones have scored you bitterly
Because you looked upon the naked sun
Oblivious of them, because you did not see 
The trees you touched or mountains that you walked upon. 

But there will come a day of darkness in the land, 
A day wherein remembered sun alone comes through
To mark the hills; then perhaps you’ll understand 
Just how it was you drew from them and they from you. 

For there will be a bent old woman in that day
Who, feeling something of this country in her bones, 
Will leave her house tapping with a stick, who will (they say) 
Come back to seek the girl she was in these familiar stones. "
A House in Taos,"  Rain 
Thunder of the Rain God: 
   And we three 
   Smitten by beauty. 

Thunder of the Rain God: 
    And we three
    Weary, weary. 

Thunder of the Rain God: 
   And you, she and I 
   Waiting for nothingness. 

Do you understand the stillness 
   Of this house in Taos
Under the thunder of the Rain God? 

  Sun
That there should be a barren garden 
About this house in Taos 
Is not so strange, 
But that there should be three barren hearts
In this one house in Taos,—
Who carries ugly things to show the sun? 

 Moon 
Did you ask for the beaten brass of the moon? 
We can buy lovely things with money, 
You, she and I, 
Yet you seek, 
As though you could keep,
This unbought loveliness of moon. 

  Wind 
Touch our bodies, wind.
Our bodies are seperate, individual things. 
Touch our bodies, wind, 
But blow quickly
Through the red, white, yellow skins
Of our bodies
To the terrible snarl,
Not mine, 
Not yours,
Not hers, 
But all one snarl of souls.
Blow quickly, wind, 
Before we run back into the windlessness,—
With our bodies,—
Into the windlessness
Of our house in Taos. "

Lookin’ for a box car
To roll me to de South.

Song for a Dark Girl,"Way down South in Dixie
  (Break the heart of me)
They hung my black young lover 
   To a cross roads tree. 

Way down South in Dixie
   (Bruised body high in air)
I asked the white Lord Jesus
   What was the use of prayer. 

Way down South in Dixie
   (Break the heart of me) 
Love is a naked shadow
   On a gnarled and naked tree. "
Prayer,"I ask you this: 
Which way to go? 
I ask you this: 
Which sin to bear? 
Which crown to put 
Upon my hair? 
I do not know, 
Lord God, 
I do not know. "

Return,"I have gone back in boyish wonderment
To things that I had foolishly put by. . . . 
Have found an alien and unknown content 
In seeing how some bits of cloud-filled sky 
Are framed in bracken pools; through chuckling hours 
Have watched the antic frogs, or curiously
Have numbered all the unnamed, vagrant flowers, 
That fleck the unkempt meadows, lavishly. 
Or where a headlong toppling stream has stayed
Its racing, lulled to quiet by the song 
Bursting from out the thickleaved oaken shade, 
There I have lain while hours sauntered past—
I have found peacefulness somewhere at last, 
Have found a quiet needed for so long. "
Salutamus,"(O Gentlemen the time of Life is short—Henry IV)

The bitterness of days like these we know; 
Much, much we know, yet cannot understand 
What was our crime that such a searing brand 
Not of our choosing, keeps us hated so. 
Despair and disappointment only grow, 
Whatever seeds are planted from our hand, 
What though some roads wind through a gladsome land? 
It is a gloomy path that we must go. 

And yet we know relief will come some day
For those seared breasts; and lads as brave again
Will plant and find a fairer crop than ours. 
It must be due our hearts, our minds, our powers; 
These are the beacons to blaze out the way. 
We must plunge onward; onward, gentlemen. . . . "
Maumee Ruth,"Might as well bury her
   And bury her deep, 
Might as well put her 
   Where she can sleep. 

Might as well lay her 
   Out in her shiny black; 
And for the love of God 
   Not wish her back. 

Maum Sal may miss her 
   Maum Sal, she only 
With no one now to scoff 
   Sal may be lonely . . . . 

Nobody else there is 
   Who will be caring 
How rocky was the road 
   For her wayfaring; 

Nobody be heeding in 
   Cabin, or town
That she is lying here 
    In her best gown. 

Boy that she suckled 
   How should he know 
Hiding in city holes 
   Sniffling the ‘snow’?

And how should the news 
   Pierce Harlem’s din 
To reach her baby gal, 
   Sodden with gin? 

To cut her withered heart
    They cannot come again, 
Preach her the lies about 
    Jordan and then 

Might as well drop her 
   Deep in the ground
Might as well pray for her 
   That she sleep sound. . . . ."
Plácido’s Farewell to His Mother,"written in the chapel of the Hospital de Santa Cristina on the night before his execution
translated from the Spanish by James Weldon Johnson
            ⁠If the unfortunate fate engulfing me,
The ending of my history of grief,
The closing of my span of years so brief,
Mother, should wake a single pang in thee,
Weep not. No saddening thought to me devote;
I calmly go to a death that is glory-filled,
My lyre before it is forever stilled
Breathes out to thee its last and dying note.
            ⁠A note scarce more than a burden-easing sigh,
Tender and sacred, innocent, sincere—
Spontaneous and instinctive as the cry
I gave at birth—And now the hour is here—
O God, thy mantle of mercy o’er my sins!
Mother, farewell! The pilgrimage begins.
    Despedida a mi madre 
  en la capilla
   Si la suerte fatal que me ha cabido,
Y el triste fin de mi sangrienta historia,
Al salir de esta vida transitoria
Deja tu corazon de muerte herido;
   Baste de llanto: el ánimo afligido
Recobre su quietud; moro en la gloria,
Y mi plácida lira á tu memoria
Lanza en la tumba su postrer sonido.
   Sonido dulce, melodioso y santo,
Glorioso, espiritual, puro y divino,
Inocente, espontáneo como el llanto
   Que vertiera al nacer: ya el cuello inclino!
Ya de la religión me cubre el manto!
Adios, mi madre! adios—El Peregrino."
The Eyes of My Regret,"Always at dusk, the same tearless experience,
The same dragging of feet up the same well-worn path
To the same well-worn rock;
The same crimson or gold dropping away of the sun
The same tints—rose, saffron, violet, lavender, grey
Meeting, mingling, mixing mistily;
Before me the same blue black cedar rising jaggedly to a point;
Over it, the same slow unlidding of twin stars,
Two eyes, unfathomable, soul-searing,
Watching, watching—watching me;
The same two eyes that draw me forth, against my will dusk after dusk;
The same two eyes that keep me sitting late into the night, chin on knees
Keep me there lonely, rigid, tearless, numbly miserable,
       —The eyes of my Regret."

            on your answering machine?
She will laugh and I will wonder what’s missing?
            (What did I forget? What does it mean
            to lose your mother? Am I brilliant yet?)
Pretty-mouthed girl with perfect diction.
            How my teachers praised me. Didn’t they love
            my lost convention, were they equipped to raise me?
If you lose your mother, tongue,
            are you a new beginning? Will the
            breaking be for love or will you hate
whatever’s ending? Going back might kill you,
            progress is a blacklist. Your voice:
            an afterlife, shadow, fist."
3.10,"Some mornings, leaving my girlfriend’s
     house, I’d glimpse my whole existence,
all its eras, as a single arc—unified, unbroken.
     I saw a person who kissed mostly men,
wrote poems in the prevailing style, owned a cat.
     I saw a different person after that,
and before, I saw a little girl.
     What was I saying? That there were
these different selves—I need you to see them—
     they were shapes made out of lines, and then
one day they all began to cross, the lines,
     as if by some obscure design
the analysis of which became the purpose
     of my life. Or maybe the pattern was 
my life, and its analysis
     merely my living. Sexuality is,
after all, a formal concern: 
     finding for one’s time on earth
a shape that feels more native than imposed—
     a shape in which desire, having chosen
it, can multiply.
     And isn’t love itself a type
of rhyme? And don’t gender and genre share one root?
     Maybe I really am a poet,
needing as I do from these imperfect sets,
     which constitute a self, the lie of sense.

"St. Valentine, Bishop of Terni, probably beheaded, was also the patron saint of asthma, beekeepers, and epilepsy, so he might have said","love in the time of COVID is no different than 
love at any other time: that is, full of loneliness.
Only more so. Pre-COVID, there were possibilities:
clandestine meetings at Trader Joe’s, Fisk’s Jubilee 
Singers’ Balm in Gilead at Tuesdays’ pancake suppers.
All attempted All for naught. Post-COVID, love will still 
be a hungry disciple with her wimple being what it always
was; her overcoat continuing to thin in all the places it was
already thinning; her outline identical to that surrounding
a bloodhound, run over. And even that outline will dissolve. 
Some say that among COVID’s symptoms are a loss of 
taste, a loss of smell. And the love loss during this COVID-
without-end emits the stink of Valentine’s remains stashed
in reliquaries, a bitter taste of beetroot laid on his holy table."
2.5,"My girlfriend’s other girlfriend was a novelist
     who every other weekend had a tryst
with B, a hedge-fund manager, in a Manhattan
     hotel room, while another woman,
also a novelist, sat beside the bed.
     All three, it should be said,
were very rich. The second novelist—
     who was, I’m told, romantically obsessed
with B—got off on watching him ejaculate inside
     my girlfriend’s girlfriend, while begging from the bedside
that he stop. At home B had an infant
     and a wife, for whose unwitting absent
body my girlfriend’s girlfriend’s made a kind of proxy—
     absorbing the animosity
of the second novelist, whose true object was
     the woman B had married. The ménage à trois
also qualified as field work, since both writers’ manuscripts
     narrated their relationship.
(Each hoped her own, of course, would be
     the better book, eventually.)
When I thought about their triangle—devised,
     it seemed, to make perverse the otherwise
bourgeois and corporate days
     in which their creativities were caged—
my mind went to my own. My vanity.
     My wile like the quiet savagery
inside a dog that gets the dog put down
     If there was a distinction to be drawn
it was only that the thought of my betrayal
     didn’t turn me on at all
but pained me in a way I couldn’t fetishize.
     And the jealousy that would arise
in me did not increase my selfish pleasure
     but threatened—so I felt—to snuff it out forever."
Proem,"I became myself.
     I became myself.
No, I always was myself.
     There’s no such person as myself.
I wouldn’t have to turn my eye
     inward, I thought, if I could train my eye
on him—the one I loved
     But I was wrong. My eye loved
everything it fell upon.
     And then one day it fell upon
a mirror. And he was nowhere
     in the mirror. And she was everywhere.
 "
An Act of Love,"Not an act, I’m told, more a leave to live 
where words have no leverage—I’ve a pile 
of words. It was useful to hear actors 
talk shop about how one doesn’t just act 
but live the role—a trick into feeling 
what doesn’t need said. I watch a cast now 
from this seat next to no one asking me
what was said like these two do, one row up. 
Once home, they’ll unwrap each other’s bow-tied 
necks; mouths agape, marvel over their spoils
as if for the first time. Look at the way
one lowers the other’s mask, levies a kiss, 
then worries back its curl over the usher
-hushed laugh, each needling the other to live."
Wetland,"The sea is so far from us now. Partly I think because we 
are not softspoken desire. There are rude thoroughfares
and abandoned mines that brag. They gather and pile
with ruin and vacancy. It’s an accrual that is in me, it seems. 
At best, a wetland. Beautiful and useless in the face of flood. 
So that when we walk the perimeter, we can see the ground 
starve and crack. But then fear of sinkhole is so self-important.
Truthfully, I am not enough to steer clear of. To fall in love again, 
dear, reforested bund, is a matter of preservation. In your expert 
opinion, will you tell me how to know you if I am forever meant 
to leave you undisturbed. This will not save us, I’m afraid. A brownstone 
for hummingbirds is shortsighted too, like picking out honeybees 
from the dog’s mouth. Then blowing on her tiny hairs like a breeze. 
Love, we can wish it were so; it does not make us fit to survive."
Love Poem Attempt 3/?,"I’ll say it—the most remarkable way a man 
has touched me is when he didn’t intend to, found
the heat of me on accident. I’m saying his hand
punctured the gap between our backs, rooted around
for the blanket we shared and swept my rib-ridged side.
In movies, that touch is the domino
that starts the chain, but his bed did not abide
by rules of fantasy. He touched me and, oh,
I held my breath. Waited for the regret
he never felt. My God, he touched me then slid
closer beneath the duvet, our spines close-set
arches that joined in the dark, kissing. I did
not know it then, but his fingers flexed with want
into the night. His heart at my back. Desire out front."
Your Hands,"I love your hands:
They are big hands, firm hands, gentle hands;
Hair grows on the back near the wrist . . . .
I have seen the nails broken and stained
From hard work.
And yet, when you touch me,
I grow small . . . . . . . and quiet . . . . . .
. . . . . . . . . And happy . . . . . . . .
If I might only grow small enough
To curl up into the hollow of your palm,
Your left palm,
Curl up, lie close and cling,
So that I might know myself always there,
. . . . . . . Even if you forgot."
Paradox,"When face to face we stand
        And eye to eye,
How far apart we are——
As far, they say, as God can ever be
From what, they say, is Hell.
                    . . . . .

But, when we stand
Fronting the other,
Mile after mile slipping in between,
O, close are we,
As close as is the shadow to the body,
As breath, to life, . . . . . . . .
As kisses are to love.
                    . . . . ."
A Mona Lisa,"                   1

I should like to creep
Through the long brown grasses
        That are your lashes;
I should like to poise
        On the very brink
Of the leaf-brown pools
        That are your shadowed eyes;
I should like to cleave
        Without sound,
Their glimmering waters,
        Their unrippled waters,
I should like to sink down
        And down
            And down . . . .
                And deeply drown.

                   2

Would I be more than a bubble breaking?
        Or an ever-widening circle
        Ceasing at the marge?
Would my white bones
        Be the only white bones
Wavering back and forth, back and forth
        In their depths?"
When the Green Lies over the Earth,"When the green lies over the earth, my dear,
A mantle of witching grace,
When the smile and the tear of the young child year
Dimple across its face,
And then flee, when the wind all day is sweet
With the breath of growing things,
When the wooing bird lights on restless feet
And chirrups and trills and sings
                  To his lady-love
                  In the green above,
Then oh! my dear, when the youth’s in the year,
Yours is the face that I long to have near,
                  Yours is the face, my dear.
But the green is hiding your curls, my dear,
Your curls so shining and sweet;
And the gold-hearted daisies this many a year
Have bloomed and bloomed at your feet,
And the little birds just above your head
With their voices hushed, my dear,
For you have sung and have prayed and have pled
                  This many, many a year.
                  And the blossoms fall,
                  On the garden wall,
And drift like snow on the green below.
                  But the sharp thorn grows
                  On the budding rose,
And my heart no more leaps at the sunset glow.
For oh! my dear, when the youth’s in the year,
Yours is the face that I long to have near,
Yours is the face, my dear."
To a Persistent Phantom,"I buried you deeper last night
You with your tears
And your tangled hair
You with your lips
That kissed so fair
I buried you deeper last night.
I buried you deeper last night
With fuller breasts
And stronger arms
With softer lips
And newer charms
I buried you deeper last night.
Deeper . . . . . . aye, deeper
And again tonight
Till that gay spirit
That once was you
Will tear its soul
In climbing through . . .
Deeper . . . . . . aye, deeper
I buried you deeper last night."
On Seeing Two Brown Boys in a Catholic Church,"It is fitting that you be here
Little brown boys
With Christ-like eyes
And curling hair.
Look you on yon crucifix
Where He hangs nailed and pierced
With head hung low
And eyes a’blind with blood that drips
From a thorny crown . . .
Look you well,
You shall know this thing.
Judas’ kiss will burn your cheek
And you shall be denied
By your Peter—
And Gethsemane . . .
You shall know full well
Gethsemane . . .
You, too, will suffer under Pontius Pilate
And feel the rugged cut of rough hewn cross
Upon your surging shoulder—
They will spit in your face
And laugh . . .
They will nail you up twixt thieves
And gamble for your little garments.
And in this you will exceed God
For on this earth
You shall know Hell—
O little brown boys
With Christ-like eyes
And curling hair
It is fitting that you be here."
Tenebris,"There is a tree, by day,
That, at night,
Has a shadow,
A hand huge and black,
With fingers long and black.
   All through the dark,
Against the white man’s house,
   In the little wind,
The black hand plucks and plucks
   At the bricks.
The bricks are the color of blood and very small.
   Is it a black hand,
   Or is it a shadow?"
The Deserter,"I know not why or whence he came
      Or how he chanced to go;
I only know he brought me love
      And going, left me woe.
I do not ask that he turn back,
      Nor seek where he may rove;
For where woe rules can never be
      The dwelling place of love.
For love went out the door of hope,
      And on and on has fled;
Caring no more to dwell within
      The house where faith is dead."
An April Day,"On such a day as this I think,
      On such as day as this,
When earth and sky and nature’s whole
      Are clad in April’s bliss;
And balmy zephyrs gently waft
      Upon your cheek a kiss;
Sufficient is it just to live
      On such a day as this."
Grass Fingers,"Touch me, touch me,
Little cool grass fingers,
Elusive, delicate grass fingers.
With your shy brushings,
Touch my face—
My naked arms—
My thighs—
My feet.
Is there nothing that is kind?
You need not fear me.
Soon I shall be too far beneath you,
For you to reach me, even,
With your tiny, timorous toes."
On Endings & Longing,"You spend too much time watching detective television. You like procedurals because it feels like ideal work: there is movement and there is predictability. The formulas go as such: One, the detective is a smart, elusively attractive thirty-something year old with attachment issues. Two, the serial killer and/or one-off criminal becomes their fixation. Three, evidence is gathered, presented, refuted, and reorganized so that four, the criminal can be caught, incarcerated. You understand after some time that the only way the episode/program will conclude is if the criminal is captured. Thus, a narrative structure is set up, and with it, a desire.
You begin to tell people about your theory: there are too many television shows and movies where the criminal is chased, and incarceration remains the conclusion. You tell people about the anxiety we might feel when the chase becomes extended, and thus the relief the conclusion (incarceration) brings. You emphasize that abolition will remain out of reach if it remains out of narrative reach. How to de-link capture from the end? How to want things to remain, extended? 
You slowly understand the purpose of the conclusion–incarceration couplet. It stems from the widespread belief that criminals should be sent away; not seen or heard from. It stems from an understanding that a forced conclusion is the ultimate punishment. Their lives become fictionally and otherwise foreclosed. There are many books and articles that have been written about the unjust logic of this rationale, the structural racism embedded into the sentencing system, racial capitalism, and the acceleration of the prison–industrial complex and they must be read. And you will cite from such books but this poem is not an evidentiary hearing, it is not attempting to convince those unconvinced neither is it speaking to those only convinced. Here, you want to ruminate on how to rupture a conclusion that has become so familial that it brings relief. How to rupture against relief. 
You spend the month of November downloading and deleting apps invented to obscure loneliness. You are in search of a transitional object but feel this is the most inappropriate profile description. No one, not even you, can handle this much brutality. You want to try pretending to be a human but can’t bear being around anymore fascists so you list your interests as: prison abolition, baking, and coral reefs. You spend the next month referring your matches to articles on the carceral state. In your teens you flirted by pretending to know less. In your thirties you send links to long peer-reviewed articles from legal journals. 
You go on two dates where you are told that your interest in politics is cute and you think, there’s a higher chance the serial killer is me. You wait an hour to tell them it’s patronizing, what they said an hour ago, is patronizing. They have already forgotten because who remembers the things they say and why do you bring things up so much after the fact. You are now exposed as the uncool subject who analyzes comments from an hour ago, who wants apologies from speakers who do not remember. If there was another way for you to be don’t they know you would try. 
You think this poem will not age well. What will be the point of these poems when there are 50 harvests left. And then again, when there are 30 harvests left will they continue to teach the drove of white men with bad diets, bad hair, bad gender and racial politics, who nevertheless were able to supposedly write universally about love and life. You think it’s true not much here is relatable. Your condition, as constructed in this moment in this body in this corner is so specific you hope it fails reconstruction. If there are no more yous to be understood. When there are no more yous desiring to be understood. 
You buy for a life you do not have. Silk blouses. Off the shoulder tops. Long floral dresses. It is cold where you are. You are without answers imploding into yourself and continue to search for the perfect white wrap dress. Pearl drop earrings. refresh. release. descend. 
You think about Jean Rhys’ Good Morning, Midnight and about the main character’s obsession with gloves and lipstick while grieving her abortion. Spoiler alert you don’t find out about that till later. You think about the emails you’ve received from stranger men about how difficult it would be to end capitalism. Men always think you don’t know and they gotta explain. It’s their love language really. Explaining shit to you treating you like the metaphorical mother they abandoned. 
You watch too many vlogs made by young women about their lives under late capitalism. They’re shot by their unthreatening boyfriends, who seem so loving and kind and helpful. There’s a dissertation in here you think, about the adaptive gaze. As in, we learn to see the way they see themselves and then the way their boyfriends do. Anyway their negotiations with consumer culture haunt you. There’s so much choice-based rhetoric and hackneyed self-help cutlets you feel hopeless. You think about We Charge Genocide about Tzara and Benjamin in Spain you think about all the women you love and have never seen. You think about all the calls made on behalf of nuance and free speech under fascism. Some people create death camps and others say let’s be kind to fascists we gotta understand their needs too it will take a while. Let’s convince fascists to step away from power. This way we can feel good about ourselves. 
This is the thing about narratives. Even when you believe they have nothing to do with you, they become part of you. Even if you have no belief in choice, capitalism, incarceration even if you have no reason to trust the police—if you subsume the arc of the story and you submit to its affective structure, and when and especially when it becomes routine, it becomes part of you? How much has it become part of you.  
You tell another friend about your thesis. You state, in detective melodrama, incarceration is the conclusion. There is no end to the episode, no conclusion to the season without it. Everyone agrees and continues to download the latest crime drama anyway. You begin to understand your anxieties are yours and never yours. What did Raymond Williams call it—the “structure of feeling.” The affective tenor being negotiated, all that is fought for in the gutter zone, in the subtext called our lives.   
You become interrupted by falling in love. In it they tell you some of their secrets and so want to break up with you but become afraid to do so. They think you will sell them out the way they do in spy films. You don’t know how to convince them that you’re not a spy you have no one to tell no one who cares all you want is to never hear from them again. All you want is to forget this episode. They insist you want revenge. What a nail this instance. This interpretation. You are without specificity or cruelties this is the revenge. You have never held specificity or cruelties this is the revenge.
You realize the louder you become about abolition and the end of capitalism the more people become interested in what you’re wearing, who you’re dating, what you look like. You look like the unsuspecting secretary of somebody’s someone and this is the profession you provide in public to strangers in lingerie stores and cafes. Your lover tells you this is the moralizing discourse many are trapped by. It’s the church model we are comfortable with and know. Example: the pastor has a critique of the world and understands salvation. The path to salvation includes no alcohol and not a lot of gay sex but maybe some lesbian sex and the pastor confesses he indulged in both before knowing god. But he doesn’t anymore. Because he doesn’t anymore he is the example. From his body comes the life model which is what one needs to be in order to have a critique. So critics of capitalism have to be like this confessional, moralizing pastor: supposedly removed from capitalism and into shaming others. Fuck that shit.
You know you’re infected and that’s your motivation for critique. You scream into your pillow that you don’t want this body and this life that’s your motivation for critique. You understand how some people understand this so much and so deeply they abandon this world altogether that’s your motivation for critique. You love and hate everything about yourself that’s your motivation for critique. You want to be a different person every day and you know you are not that’s your motivation for critique. Fuck liberal activism and their small compact business models for revolution that’s your motivation for critique.
You worry that everything you like about yourself is just what has been colonized so deeply that’s your motivation for critique. It’s inside every day and floods out the way poems do sometimes you would never pretend to know the better you would never pretend to be above it you would never prescribe anything to anyone who feels it too that’s your motivation for critique.
You are repressed and unrepressed which means you are living in late capitalism. You diagnose your insides according to the blog posts, podcasts, quizzes available online and they all confirm that you are like the rest of them which is a relief. No more special or difficult. And what you have can be cured: procedures, walks to go on, smoothies to make. They have thoughts on how to cure you and this is both liberating and crushing. People have spent lives studying compressions of you so you don’t have to and they have a plan. You are not alone this is not unique your repressed unrepression they have new compositions of you for you.
You watch one last cop comedy while making dinner. You cut sweet yams, sauté leafy greens and eat carrots from the counter. The film exists as broadcast radio. By the time the cooking is complete you return to the drama. You thought it was slapstick throughout but suddenly something shifts. The daughter of the head detective appears. You think, what dadaism is this when did she have a child. The daughter holds a sack lunch in her hands and tells her mother that in her next life she hopes to return as criminal. So that she could be remembered. Chased. Packed and unpacked, agonized and antagonized, by her. Complicated and central to her. You turn everything off. You don’t go back. This is the end, you tell yourself. 
You research the demise of debtors’ prisons because this is your life’s work: gathering evidence until the proof becomes accepted. You can already hear the criticism of skeptics. In their narrative discomfort they will argue debtors’ prisons are both unlike and like current prisons. It’s true, one could argue that debtors’ prisons never went away as the poor remain incarcerated but on the other hand, you repeat a version of them did go away and that feels like a sliver of something to be repeated. The emphasis, you capitulate, is that we invented something and then decided it did not need to exist. Is this not of interest to you? It’s made mortal and immortal. It can be made to decompose and vanish. Is this not of interest to you. 
You want to be held by someone who is ashamed to be with you. It’s been a long day and solace must be found so you go to the only place you know for instantaneous kindness and softness: the subreddit forum on shoplifting. A place full of girls letting you know if the cameras record, if they’re monitored, how advanced their zoom functions might be and the ratings for difficulty should you proceed. It’s so caring and full of warmth it’s what everyone thought the internet would be. A space for kindness amongst strangers working to slowly burn it all down"
Four Walls,"Four great walls have hemmed me in.
Four strong, high walls:
Right and wrong,
Shall and shan’t.
The mighty pillars tremble when
My conscience palls
And sings its song—
I can, I can’t.
If for a moment Samson’s strength
Were given me I’d shove
Them away from where I stand;
Free, I know I’d love
To ramble soul and all,
And never dread to strike a wall.
Again, I wonder would that be
Such a happy state for me . . .
The going, being, doing, sham—
And never knowing where I am.
I might not love freedom at all;
My tired wings might crave a wall—
Four walls to rise and pen me in
This conscious world with guarded men."
To an Icicle,"Chilled into a serenity
As rigid as your pose
You linger trustingly,
But a gutter waits for you.
Your elegance does not secure
You favors with the sun.
He is not one to pity fragileness.
He thinks all cheeks should burn
And feel how tears can run."
My House,"For this peculiar tint that paints my house
Peculiar in an alien atmosphere
Where other houses wear a kindred hue,
I have a stirring always very rare
And romance-making in my ardent blood,
That channels through my body like a flood.
I know the dark delight of being strange,
The penalty of difference in the crowd,
The loneliness of wisdom among fools,
Yet never have I felt but very proud,
Though I have suffered agonies of hell,
Of living in my own peculiar cell.
There is an exaltation of man’s life,
His hidden life, that he alone can feel.
The blended fires that heat his veins within,
Shaping his metals into finest steel,
Are elements from his own native earth,
That the wise gods bestowed on him at birth.
Oh each man’s mind contains an unknown realm
Walled in from other men however near,
An unimagined in their highest flights
Of comprehension or of vision clear;
A realm where he withdraws to contemplate
Infinity and his own finite state.
Thence he may sometimes catch a god-like glimpse
Of mysteries that seems beyond life’s bar;
Thence he may hurt his little shaft at heaven
And bring down accidentally a star,
And drink its foamy dust like sparkling wine
And echo accents of the laugh divine.
Then he may fall into a drunken sleep
And wake up in his same house painted blue
Or white or green or red or brown or black—
His house, his own, whatever be the hue.
But things for him will not be what they seem
To average men since he has dreamt his dream!"
Absence,"Your words dropped into my heart like pebbles into a pool,
Rippling around my breast and leaving it melting cool.
Your kisses fell sharp on my flesh like dawn-dews from the limb
Of a fruit-filled lemon tree when the day is young and dim.
Like soft rain-christened sunshine, as fragile as rare gold lace,
Your breath, sweet-scented and warm, has kindled my tranquil face.
But a silence vasty-deep, oh deeper than all these ties
Now, through the menacing miles, brooding between us lies.
And more than the songs I sing, I await your written word,
To stir my fluent blood as never your presence stirred."
That Hill,"It crawled away from ’neath my feet
And left me standing there;
A little at a time, went up
An atmospheric stair.
I couldn’t go for watching it,
To see where it would stop;
A tree sprang out and waved to me
When it had reached the top.
The tree kept nodding friendly like,
Beckoning me to follow;
And I went crawling up and up,
Like it did from the hollow.
Then I saw why the thing would go
A-soaring from the dell—
’Twas nearing Heaven every bound,
And fleeing fast from Hell!"
Revelation,"  She walked along the crowded street
Forgetting all but that she
Was walking as the other girls
And dressed as carefully.
The windows of the stores were frilled
To lure femininity,
To empty little pocketbooks
And assuage queen vanity.
And so my walker liked a dress
Of silver and of gold,
Draped on a bisque mannequin
So blond and slim and bold.
She took the precious metal home
And waved her soft black hair;
Powder, rouge and lipstick made
Her very neat and fair.
She slipped the dress on carefully,
Her vain dream fell away. . . .
The mirror showed a brownskin girl
She hadn’t seen all day!
  “ You have classic features,
Something like Cleopatra.
Eyes like whirlpools
And as dangerous. . . .
Weeping willow eyelashes
Shade the mighty depth
Of your eyes.   Your lips
Are danger signals
Which a fool like me
Will not regard. . . .
But go dashing past them
To gain a kiss . . . or Death. ”
                 That is what he said to me,
I filled with a sweet and vain regret
That Beauty, the stranger, and I had met.
His praise was heat to drink me dry.
So I found a stream, and with a sigh
I stooped to drink . . . ah, to see
The cruel water reflecting me!
Dark-eyed, thick-lipped, harsh, short hair . . .
But Lucifer saw himself, too, fair."
Poem,"Ah, I know what happiness is. . . .
It is a timid little fawn
Creeping softly up to me
For one caress, then gone
Before I’m through with it . . .
Away, like dark from dawn!
Well I know what happiness is . . . !
It is the break of day that wears
A shining dew decked diadem . . .
An aftermath of tears.
Fawn and dawn, emblems of joy . . .
I’ve played with them for years,
And always they will slip away
Into the brush of another day."
The Walls of Jericho,"Jericho is on the inside
Of the things the world likes best;
“We want in,” the dark ones cried,
“We will love it as the rest.”
“Let me learn,” the dark ones say.
They have learned that Faith must do
More than meditate and pray
That a boulder may fall through
Making one large man size entrance
Into wondrous Jericho.
They have learned: forget the distance,
Count no steps, nor stop to blow.
Jericho still has her high wall,
Futile barrier of Power. . . .
Echoed with the dark ones’ footfall
Marching around her every hour;
Knowledge strapped down like a knapsack
Not cumbersome, and money
Not too much to strain the back. . . .
Dark ones seeking milk and honey.
Over in the city staring
Up at us along the wall
Are the fat ones, trembling, swearing
There is no room there for us all!
But there’ve been too many rounds
Made to give the trip up here.
Shout for joy . . . hear how it sounds. . . .
The very walls echo with cheer!"
Requiem,"She wears, my beloved, a rose upon her head.
Walk softly angels, lest your gentle tread
Awake her to the turmoil and the strife,
The dissonance and hates called life.
She sleeps, my beloved, a rose upon her head.
Who says she will not hear, that she is dead?
The rose will fade and lose its lovely hue,
But not, my beloved, will fading wither you."
The New Negro,"He scans the world with calm and fearless eyes,
      Conscious within of powers long since forgot;
At every step, new man-made barriers rise
      To bar his progress—but he heeds them not.
He stands erect, though tempests round him crash,
      Though thunder bursts and billows surge and roll;
He laughs and forges on, while lightings flash
      Along the rocky pathway to his goal.
Impassive as a Sphinx, he stares ahead—
      Foresees new empires rise and old ones fall;
While caste-mad nations lust for blood to shed,
      He sees God’s finger writing on the wall.
With soul awakened, wise and strong he stands,
Holding his destiny within his hands."
Challenge,"I said, in drunken pride of youth and you
That mischief-making Time would never dare
Play his ill-humored tricks upon us two,
Strange and defiant lovers that we were.
I said that even Death, Highwayman Death,
Could never master lovers such as we,
That even when his clutch had throttled breath,
My hymns would float in praise, undauntedly.
I did not think such words were bravado.
Oh, I think honestly we knew no fear,
We loved each other so.
And thus, with you believing me, I made
My prophecies, rebellious, unafraid . . . .
And that was foolish, wasn’t it, my dear?"
Solace,"My window opens out into the trees
And in that small space 
Of branches and of sky 
I see the seasons pass 
Behold the tender green 
Give way to darker heavier leaves. 
The glory of the autumn comes 
When steeped in mellow sunlight 
The fragile, golden leaves
Against a clear blue sky 
Linger in the magic of the afternoon 
And then reluctantly break off
And filter down to pave
A street with gold. 
Then bare, gray branches 
Lift themselves against the 
Cold December sky 
Sometimes weaving a web 
Across the rose and dusk of late sunset 
Sometimes against a frail new moon
And one bright star riding
A sky of that dark, living blue 
Which comes before the heaviness
Of night descends, or the stars
Have powdered the heavens. 
Winds beat against these trees; 
The cold, but gentle rain of spring 
Touches them lightly
The summer torrents strive 
To lash them into a fury 
And seek to break them—
But they stand. 
My life is fevered
And a restlessness at times
An agony—again a vague 
And baffling discontent 
Possesses me. 
I am thankful for my bit of sky
And trees, and for the shifting 
Pageant of the seasons. 
Such beauty lays upon the heart 
A quiet. 
Such eternal change and permanence
Take meaning from all turmoil
And leave serenity 
Which knows no pain. "
The Mask,"So detached and cool she is
No motion e’er betrays 
The secret life within her soul, 
The anguish of her days. 

She seems to look upon the world 
With cold ironic eyes, 
To spurn emotions’s fevered sway, 
To scoff at tears and sighs. 

But once a woman with a child
Passed by her on the street, 
And once she heard from casual lips
A man’s name, bitter-sweet. 

Such baffled yearning in her eyes,
Such pain upon her face! 
I turned aside until the mask 
Was slipped once more in place. "
Interim,"The night was made for rest and sleep, 
For winds that softly sigh; 
It was not made for grief and tears; 
So then why do I cry? 

The wind that blows through leafy trees
Is soft and warm and sweet; 
For me the night is a gracious cloak 
To hide my soul’s defeat. 

Just one dark hour of shaken depths, 
Of bitter black despair—
Another day will find me brave,
And not afraid to dare. "
Lines Written at the Grave of Alexander Dumas,"Cemeteries are places for departed souls
And bones interred, 
Or hearts with shattered loves. 
A woman with lips made warm for laughter 
Would find grey stones and roving spirits
Too chill for living, moving pulses . . .
And thou, great spirit, wouldst shiver in thy granite shroud 
Should idle mirth or empty talk 
Disturb thy tranquil sleeping. 

A cemetery is a place for shattered loves
And broken hearts . . . . 
Bowed before the crystal chalice of thy soul,
I find the multi-colored fragrances of thy mind
Has lost itself in Death’s transparency. 

Oh, stir the lucid waters of thy sleep 
And coin for me a tale 
Of happy loves and gems and joyous limbs
And hearts where love is sweet! 

A cemetery is a place for broken hearts 
And silent thought . . . 
And silence never moves, 
Nor speaks nor sings. "
Your Songs,"When first you sang a song to me
With laughter shining from your eyes, 
You trolled your music liltingly
With cadences of glad surprise. 
In after years I heard you croon
In measures delicately slow 
Of trees turned silver by the moon
And nocturnes sprites and lovers know. 
And now I cannot hear you sing, 
But love still holds your melody
For silence is a sounding thing
To one who listens hungrily. "
Advice,"You were a sophist,
Pale and quite remote, 
As you bade me
Write poems—
Brown poems 
Of dark words
And prehistoric rhythms . . . 
Your pallor stifled my poesy 
But I remembered a tapestry
That I would some day weave 
Of dim purples and fine reds
And blues 
Like night and death—
The keen precision of your words 
Wove a silver thread 
Through the dusk softness 
Of my dream-stuff. . . ."
Secret,"I shall make a song like your hair . . . . 
gold-woven with shadows green-tinged, 
And I shall play with my song 
As my fingers might play with your hair.
Deep in my heart
I shall play with my song of you, 
Gently . . . . 
I shall laugh
At its sensitive lustre . . . 
I shall wrap my song in a blanket, 
Blue like your eyes are blue 
With tiny shots of silver. 
I shall wrap it caressingly, 
Tenderly . . . . 
I shall sing a lullaby
To the song I have made 
Of your hair and eyes . . . 
And you will never know 
That deep in my heart
I shelter a song of you
Secretly . . . . "
Day and Night,"The day is a Negro 
   Yelling out of breath. 
The night is a Negro
    Laughing up to death. 

The day is a jazz band 
   Blasting loud and wild. 
The night is a jazz band
   Moaning Blues songs, child. 

The day is the sunshine 
   Undressed in the stree. 
The night is the sunshine
   Dressed from head to feet. 

I am like a rainbow 
  Arched across the way. 
Yes, I am a rainbow
  Being night nor day. "
Tanka I–VIII,"I

Could I but retrace 
The winding stairs fate built me. 
They fell from my feet. 
Now I stand on the high round. 
Down beneath height above depth—

II

Through the eyes of life
I looked in at my own heart:
A long furrowed field 
Grown cement waiting for seed
Baking in desolation. 

III. 

Drink in moods of joy! 
Why should the sky be lonely? 
Neither sun nor moon—
How my heart is shy of night 
Like Autumn’s leaf brown pendants 

IV

Cold against the sky 
The blue jays cried at dawning. 
The larks where are they? 
Heavily upon the air 
My ears tuned in to listen. 

V 

So this is the reed? 
The very pips for singing—
Life plays me new songs. 
Wistfully from out the dawn
The crows broke across the sky! 

VI

And now Spring has come 
Blossoming up my garden. 
I alone unchanged, 
Moving in my house of Autumn. 
One leaf alone saves a tree. 

VII

By the pool of life 
Willows are drooping tonight
I can see no stars. 
What dances in the water?
O my clouds dripping with tears. 

VIII

Could I hear your voice
O but this silence is sweet 
Words mar all beauty. 
Turn then into your own heart 
And pluck the roots from the soil—"
The Dark Brother,"“Lo, I am black but I am comely too, 
Black as the night, black as the deep dark caves. 
I am the scion of a race of slaves
Who helped to build a nation strong that you 
And I may stand within the world’s full view, 
Fearless and firm as dreadnoughts on rough waves; 
Holding a banner high whose floating braves
The opposition of the tried untrue. 

Casting an eye of love upon my face, 
Seeing a newer light within my eyes, 
A rarer beauty in your brother race
Will merge upon your visioning fullwise. 
Though I am black my heart through love is pure, 
And you through love my blackness shall endure!”"
Russian Cathedral,"Bow down my soul in worship very low
And in the holy silences be lost.
Bow down before the marble man of woe,
Bow down before the singing angel host.
What jewelled glory fills my spirit’s eye!
What golden grandeur moves the depths of me!
The soaring arches lift me up on high
Taking my breath with their rare symmetry.
Bow down my soul and let the wondrous light
Of beauty bathe thee from her lofty throne,
Bow down before the wonder of man’s might.
Bow down in worship, humble and alone;
Bow lowly down before the sacred sight
Of man’s divinity alive in stone."
The Wild Goat,"O you would clothe me in silken frocks
      And house me from the cold,
And bind with bright bands my glossy locks,
      And buy me chains of gold.
And give me—meekly to do my will—
      The hapless sons of men:—
But the wild goat bounding on the barren hill
      Droops in the grassy pen."
The Venus of Milo,"O peerless marble marvel! what of grace,
Or matchless symmetry is not enshrined
In thy rare contours! Could we hope to find
The regal dignity of that fair face
In aught less beautiful? We would retrace,
At sight of thee, our willing steps where wind
The paths great Homer trod. Within whose mind
Wast thou a dream, O Goddess? Nearer pace
Brave Hector, reckless Paris, as we gaze;
Then stately temples, fluted colonnades
Rise in their sculptured beauty. Yes! ’tis Greece,
With all the splendor of her lordliest days,
That comes to haunt us: ere the glory fades
Let Fancy bid the rapture never cease."
Questing,"Let me learn now where Beauty is;
My day is spent too far toward night
To wander aimlessly and miss her place;
To grope, eyes shut, and fingers touching space.
Her maidens I have known, seen durance beside,
Handmaidens to the Queen, whose duty bids
Them lie and lure afield their Vestal’s acolyte,
Lest a human shake the throne, lest a god should know his might:
Nereid, daughter of the Trident, steering in her shell,
Paused in voyage, smile beguiling, tempted and I fell;
Spiteful dryads, sport forsaking, tossing birchen wreathes,
Left the Druidic priests they teased so
In the oaken trees, crying, “Ho a mortal! here a believer!”
Bound me, she who held the sceptre, stricken by her, ah, deceiver…
But let me learn now where beauty is;
I was born to know her mysteries,
And needing wisdom I must go in vain:
Being sworn bring to some hither land,
Leaf from her brow, light from her torchéd hand. 
 "
When I See the Stars in the Night Sky,"I think of Whitney Houston    in her sequined glamour
   She’s centerstage      It’s 1988           Her head
             Thrown back against a black backdrop     She is the only thing
      glowing       So distant                        from us in the universe
    of her voice                 She is already dying       when
I hear her sing the first time          When I slip inside
   my rhinestone leotard white tights          Before a mic
              My vocal chords are still elastic                  Vibrating harpstring
    Not yet sclerotic with unlovely smoke                    and shame
    I’m drawn to Whitney like a cardinal on a branch
in winter            Beauty too bright for camouflage                 Her story
a constellation twinned with mine. I love myself 

          because of her. Our sweet lip sweat sparkling in the flame
light. I went home inside myself too. The world became so small.  
          Secrets collapsing my life into a vacuum. To burn a little longer—
Whitney, you know           no one is coming—you must        save yourself."
LXXXVIII (The Sonnets),"A Final Sonnet
For Chris
How strange to be gone in a minute!     A man
Signs a shovel and so he digs     Everything
Turns into writing a name for a day
                                            Someone
is having a birthday and someone is getting
married and someone is telling a joke     my dream
a white tree     I dream of the code of the west
But this rough magic I here abjure     and
When I have required some heavenly music     which even now
I do     to work mine end upon their senses
That this aery charm is for     I’ll break
My staff     bury it certain fathoms in the earth
And deeper than did ever plummet sound
I’ll drown my book.
It is 5:15 a.m.                                           Dear Chris,
hello.
 "
Instructions for the End,"push the needle of the pen
burning sensation
then pour grief in
there are many kinds of loss
some have names some we swallow
fit what you can in a pill
there is no plan to save us
trespassers take up your tools
we will store things here we need
and when the siren sounds
lay mirrors in the street
bring heaven down to earth"
Alpha,"the atmosphere makes earth look blue. life started with one cell that somehow split in two. who wrote what to whom. the universe contains the universe. a faint milky circle, a blank field. one lie leads to the next. the comfort of something complex that connects us. do you feel this. yes. I could tell you everything but then what would be left. there is a thing that needs to be built (the name for it). how do I say this (imperfectly). the difference between the microscope, telescope, and pen suspended by a single thread—pull and then it ends"
Aubade: Nocturne,"Harder, he pants into the scruff of my neck, our labored breath
condensing as my lover pulls my hips into wolfish grind.
From a distance, we are two curs fogging a parked Chrysler,
though this, only half-accurate. In our nest, we transcend sex
-ed things, white-hot spangles like dead gods, the glow of us
pulsing brighter & brighter in turn. I have never shouted before,
but this is how he wets my nose—open, like a howl, a deafening
unhinging of worship—from the back—this, the way he whines—
throwing his head in praise. It is ancient composition, how we fever
the dark’s bones, convince the night to do our bidding.
We collapse into each other. The moon of him eclipsing
the fullness of me, the rift of us unfolding unto new darkness
& what are we but ravenous? Here, we devour dusk, suckle
sides of cosmic gristle, mouths brimming, tearing the sky, Black."
Love Poem in the Black Field,"Parchman Farm Chain Gang, Sunflower County Mississippi, 1911
How long since my left foot has known a day
    It did not spend drug along by your right? Since the first
Rust-iron rattlers made fields of cattails kneel, fronds
    Curdling like browlines in brutal heat? I forget
My name, its sins, when I march behind you. I know nothing
    Of before. Nothing but your nape, its tributary of creases;
But your gait, pressing smooth miles of streetside weeds.
    What else can a lonesome roadboy do but look
At the one to his front: you, with keloid scars inside
    Even your ears, you with long lashes that, when blinked,
Seem heavier than these chains, all the men they carry.
    What I wouldn’t give to see your eyes open again
After that brief, merciful closing. What I don’t have
    to give. What I know, if I did, I would."
LXVII (The Sonnets),"(clarity! clarity!) a semblance of motion, omniscience.
There is no such thing as a breakdown
To cover the tracks of “The Hammer”     (the morning sky
gets blue and red and I get worried about
mountains of mounting pressure
and the rust on the bolt in my door
Some kind of Bowery Santa Clauses     I wonder
down the secret streets of Roaring Gap
A glass of chocolate milk, head of lettuce, dark-
Bearden is dead. Chris is dead. Jacques Villon is dead.
Patsy awakens in heat and ready to squabble
I wonder if people talk about me secretly? I wonder if I’m
     fooling myself
about pills? I wonder what’s in the icebox? out we go
to the looney movie     and the grace of the make-believe bed"
XXXVI (The Sonnets),"After Frank O’Hara
It’s 8:54 a.m. in Brooklyn it’s the 28th of July and
it’s probably 8:54 in Manhattan but I’m 
in Brooklyn I’m eating English muffins and drinking
pepsi and I’m thinking of how Brooklyn is New
York city too how odd I usually think of it as
something all its own like Bellows Falls like Little
Chute like Uijongbu
                               I never thought on the Williams-
burg bridge I’d come so much to Brooklyn
just to see lawyers and cops who don’t even carry
guns taking my wife away and bringing her back
                                                                             No
and I never thought Dick would be back at Gude’s
beard shaved off long hair cut and Carol reading
his books when we were playing cribbage and
watching the sun come up over the Navy Yard
across the river
                         I think I was thinking when I was
ahead I’d be somewhere like Perry street erudite
dazzling slim and badly loved
contemplating my new book of poems
to be printed in simple type on old brown paper
feminine marvelous and tough"
Canopy,"Like a tree, he interprets light.
Papa Bois, old woodsman, come see
how this golden son paints your domain—
sycamore’s plainsong, pine’s keen sigh,
aspen’s conspiring laughter—be
a witness to his legerdemain.
                                                When branches thrash outside your window
                                                you sometimes believe you’re the storm
                                                that moves them, displaced hurricane.
                                                You tell no one. That’s nothing new.
                                                The South taught you early to conform,
                                                to wear a mask that’s become urbane.
                        From star to star the mental optics rove.
                        If only your hard labor conjured love."
True Love,"Her love is true I know,
Much more true
Than angel’s love;
For angels love in heaven
Where a thousand harps
Are playing.
She loves in a tenement
Where the only music
She hears
Is the cry of street car brakes
And the toot of automobile horns
And the drip of a kitchen spigot
All day.
Her love is true I know."
Continental Breakfast,"I know we the finest Black folk in this southern, La Quinta Inn, but damn,
the White folk won’t stop lookin’ at us funny. The 2% milk-carton faces
the backside of a fridge’s glass door; classic Lucky Charms in Styrofoam
bowls, which squeak when you bend them. It’s unremarkable here
but we’re at least bored together, in line for food . . . news on a monitor
propagandizing in one ear, coming out abandoned in the only Other.
When there’s nothing to do, our Blacknesses practices metamorphosis.
This du-rag used as coffee sleeve. Bonnet as lampshade. We’d retire
in the pagoda with cigarette butts decorating cobblestone like flower stems.
I want to outgrow the flammable baggage that we left in the room
of our memory. Sometimes, when you forget what I say, I feel better for it.
As if, I get to share something with you . . . again, but what was that [thing
you said], in our argument about [something I forgot]? We are in the lobby,
silent, waiting for the other to disturb our discontent with a pun about crackers."
The Radical,"Men never know
What they are doing.
They always make a muddle
Of their affairs,
They always tie their affairs
Into a knot
They cannot untie.
Then I come in
Uninvited.
They do not ask me in;
I am the radical,
The bomb thrower,
I untie the knot
That they have made,
And they never thank me."
Dust,"Dust,
Through which
Proud blood
Once flowed.
Dust,
Where a civilization
Flourished.
Dust,
The Valley of the Nile,
Dust,
You proud ones, proud of the skill
With which you play this game––Civilization;
Do not forget that it is a very old game.
Men used to play it on the banks
Of the Tigris and the Euphrates
When the world was a wilderness.
There is a circle around China
Where once a wall stood.
Carthage is a heap of ashes.
And Rome knew the pomp and glory
You know now.
The Coliseum tells a story
The Woolworth Building may repeat.
Dust,
Pharaohs and their armies sleep there.
Dust,
Shall it stir again?
Will Pharaohs rise and rule
And their armies march once more?
Civilization continually shifts
Upon the places of the earth."
I Think I See Him There,"I think I see Him there
With a stern dream on his face
I see Him there—
Wishing they would hurry
The last nail in place.
And I wonder, had I been there,
Would I have doubted too
Or would the dream have told me,
What this man speaks is true."
A Triviality,"Not to dance with her
Was such a trivial thing
There were girls more fair than she,––
To-day
Ten girls dressed in white.
Each had a white rose wreath.
They made a dead man’s arch
And ten strong men
Carried a body through.
Not to dance with her
Was a trivial thing."
The Death Bed,"All the time they were praying
He watched the shadow of a tree
Flicker on the wall.
There is no need of prayer,
He said,
No need at all.
The kin-folk thought it strange
That he should ask them from a dying bed.
But they left all in a row
And it seemed to ease him
To see them go.
There were some who kept on praying
In a room across the hall
And some who listened to the breeze
That made the shadows waver
On the wall.
He tried his nerve
On a song he knew
And made an empty note
That might have come,
From a bird’s harsh throat.
And all the time it worried him
That they were in there praying
And all the time he wondered
What it was they could be saying."
Cavalier,"Slay fowl and beast; pluck clean the vine,
Prepare the feast and pearl the wine.
Bring on the best! Bring on the bard,
Bring on the rest. Let nought retard
Nor yet distress with putrid breath,
My new mistress, My Lady Death."
Incident,"Once riding in old Baltimore,
    Heart-filled, head-filled with glee,
I saw a Baltimorean
    Keep looking straight at me.
Now I was eight and very small,
    And he was no whit bigger,
And so I smiled, but he poked out
    His tongue and called me, “Nigger.”
I saw the whole of Baltimore
    From May until December:
Of all the things that happened there
    That’s all that I remember."
Four Epitaphs,"                            1
             For my Grandmother
This lovely flower fell to seed;
Work gently sun and rain;
She held it as her dying creed
That she would grow again.

For John Keats, Apostle of Beauty
Not writ in water nor in mist,
Sweet lyric throat, thy name.
Thy singing lips that could death kissed
Have seared his own with flame.
                            3
         For Paul Laurence Dunbar
Born of the sorrowful of heart
Mirth was a crown upon his head;
Pride kept his twisted lips apart
In jest, to hide a heart that bled.
                            4
                For a Lady I Know
She even thinks that up in heaven
    Her class lies late and snores,
While poor black cherubs rise at seven
    To do celestial chores."
"To John Keats, Poet, at Springtime","I cannot hold my peace, John Keats;
There never was a spring like this;
It is an echo, that repeats
My last year’s song and next year’s bliss.
I know, in spite of all men say
Of Beauty, you have felt her most.
Yea, even in your grave her way
Is laid. Poor, troubled, lyric ghost,
Spring never was so fair and dear
As Beauty makes her seem this year.
I cannot hold my peace, John Keats;
I am as helpless in the toil
Of spring as any lamb that bleats
To feel the solid earth recoil
Beneath his puny legs. Spring beats
Her tocsin call to those who love her,
And lo! the dogwood petals cover
Her breast with drifts of snow, and sleek
White gulls fly screaming to her, and hover
About her shoulders, and kiss her cheek,
While white and purple lilacs muster
A strength that bears them to a cluster
Of color and odor; for her sake
All things that slept are now awake.
And you and I, shall we lie still,
John Keats, while Beauty summons us?
Somehow I feel your sensitive will
Is pulsing up some tremulous
Sap road of a maple tree, whose leaves
Grow music as they grow, since your
Wild voice is in them, a harp that grieves
For life that opens death’s dark door.
Though dust, your fingers still can push
The Vision Splendid to a birth,
Though now they work as grass in the hush
Of the night on the broad sweet page of the earth.
“John Keats is dead,” they say, but I
Who hear your full insistent cry
In bud and blossom, leaf and tree,
Know John Keats still writes poetry.
And while my head is earthward bowed
To read new life sprung from your shroud,
Folks seeing me must think it strange
That merely spring should so derange
My mind. They do not know that you,
John Keats, keep revel with me, too."
From the Dark Tower,"We shall not always plant while others reap
The golden increment of bursting fruit,
Not always countenance, abject and mute,
That lesser men should hold their brothers cheap;
Not everlastingly while others sleep
Shall we beguile their limbs with mellow flute,
Not always bend to some more subtle brute;
We were not made eternally to weep.
The night whose sable breast relieves the stark
White stars is no less lovely, being dark;
And there are buds that cannot bloom at all
In light, but crumple, piteous, and fall;
So in the dark we hide the heart that bleeds,
And wait, and tend our agonizing seeds."
To Lovers of Earth: Fair Warning,"Give over to high things the fervent thought
You waste on Earth; let down the righteous bar
Against a wayward peace too dearly bought
Upon this pale and passion-frozen star.
Sweethearts and friends, are they not loyal? Far
More fickle, false, perverse, far more unkind,
Is Earth to those who give her heart and mind.
And you whose lusty youth her snares intrigue,
Who glory in her seas, swear by her clouds,
With Age, man’s foe, Earth ever is in league.
Time resurrects her even while he crowds
Your bloom to dust, and lengthens out your shrouds
A day’s length or a year’s. She will be young
When your last cracked and quivering note is sung.
She will remain the Earth, sufficient still
Though you are gone, and with you that rare loss
That vanishes with your bewildered will;
And there shall flame no red, indignant cross
For you, no quick white scar of wrath emboss
The sky, no blood drip from a wounded moon,
And not a single star chime out of tune."
Yet Do I Marvel,"I doubt not God is good, well-meaning, kind,
And did he stoop to quibble could tell why
The little buried mole continuous blind,
Why flesh that mirrors him must some day die,
Make plain the reason tortured Tantalus
Is baited with the fickle fruit, declare
If merely brute caprice dooms Sisyphus
To struggle up a never-ending stair.
Inscrutable His ways are and immune
To catechism by a mind too strewn
With petty cares to slightly understand
What awful brain compels His awful hand;
Yet do I marvel at this curious thing:
To make a poet black, and bid him sing!"
Quoits,"In wintertime I have such fun
When I play quoits with father.
I beat him almost every game.
He never seems to bother.
He looks at mother and just smiles.
All this seems strange to me,
For when he plays with grown-up folks,
He beats them easily."
Wild Roses,"What! Roses growing in a meadow
Where all the cattle browse?
I’d think they’d fear the very shadow
Of daddy’s big rough cows.
 "
The Baker’s Boy,"The baker’s boy delivers loaves
All up and down our street.
His car is white, his clothes are white,
White to his very feet.
I wonder if he stays that way.
I don’t see how he does all day.
I’d like to watch him going home
When all the loaves are out.
His clothes must look quite different then,
At least I have no doubt."
Sky Pictures,"Sometimes a right white mountain
Or great soft polar bear,
Or lazy little flocks of sheep
Move on in the blue air.
The mountains tear themselves like floss,
The bears all melt away.
The little sheep will drift apart
In such a sudden way.
And then new sheep and mountains come.
New polar bears appear
And roll and tumble on again
Up in the skies so clear.
The polar bears would like to get
Where polar bears belong.
The mountains try so hard to stand
In one place firm and strong.
The little sheep all want to stop
And pasture in the sky,
But never can these things be done,
Although they try and try!"
Sassafras Tea,"The sass’fras tea is red and clear
In my white china cup,
So pretty I keep peeping in
Before I drink it up.
I stir it with a silver spoon,
And sometimes I just hold
Al little tea inside the spoon,
Like it was lined with gold.
It makes me hungry just to smell
The nice hot sass’fras tea,
And that’s the one thing I really like
That they say’s good for me."
Pansy,"Oh, the blue blue bloom
On the velvet cheek
Of the little pansy’s face
That hides away so still and cool
In some soft garden place!
The tiger lily’s orange fires,
The red lights from the rose
Aren’t like the gloom on that blue cheek
Of the softest flower that grows!
 "
Creed,"If my garden oak spares one bare ledge
For a boughed mistletoe to grow and wedge;
And all the wild birds this year should know
I cherish their freedom to come and go;
If a battered worthless dog, masterless, alone,
Slinks to my heels, sure of bed and bone;
And the boy just moved in, deigns a glance-assay,
Turns his pockets inside out, calls, “Come and play!”
If I should surprise in the eyes of my friend
That the deed was my favor he’d let me lend;
Or hear it repeated from a foe I despise,
That I whom he hated was chary of lies;
If a pilgrim stranger, fainting and poor,
Followed an urge and rapped at my door,
And my husband loves me till death puts apart,
Less as flesh unto flesh, more as heart unto heart:
I may challenge God when we meet That Day,
And He dare not be silent or send me away."
Protest,"I long not now, a little while at least,
For that serene interminable hour
When I shall leave this barmecidal feast,
With poppy for my everlasting flower.
I long not now for that dim cubicle
Of earth to which my lease will not expire,
Where he who comes a tenant there may dwell
Without a thought of famine, flood, or fire.
Surely that house has quiet to bestow:
Still tongue, spent pulse, heart pumped of its last throb,
The fingers tense and tranquil in a row,
The throat unwelled with any sigh or sob.
But time to live, to love, bear pain and smile,
Oh, we are given such a little while!"
When Dawn Comes to the City," The tired cars go grumbling by,
        The moaning, groaning cars,
    And the old milk carts go rumbling by
        Under the same dull stars.
    Out of the tenements, cold as stone,
        Dark figures start for work;
    I watch them sadly shuffle on,
        ’Tis dawn, dawn in New York.
        But I would be on the island of the sea,
        In the heart of the island of the sea,
    Where the cocks are crowing, crowing, crowing,
    And the hens are cackling in the rose-apple tree,
Where the old draft-horse is neighing, neighing, neighing,
        Out on the brown dew-silvered lawn,
    And the tethered cow is lowing, lowing, lowing,
And dear old Ned is braying, braying, braying,
And the shaggy Nannie goat is calling, calling, calling
    From her little trampled corner of the long wide lea
That stretches to the waters of the hill-stream falling
    Sheer upon the flat rocks joyously!
    There, oh, there! on the island of the sea,
        There I would be at dawn.
    The tired cars go grumbling by,
        The crazy, lazy cars,
    And the same milk carts go rumbling by
        Under the dying stars.
    A lonely newsboy hurries by,
        Humming a recent ditty;
    Red streaks strike through the gray of the sky,
        The dawn comes to the city.
        But I would be on the island of the sea,
        In the heart of the island of the sea,
    Where the cocks are crowing, crowing, crowing,
    And the hens are cackling in the rose-apple tree,
Where the old draft-horse is neighing, neighing, neighing
        Out on the brown dew-silvered lawn,
    And the tethered cow is lowing, lowing, lowing,
And dear old Ned is braying, braying, braying,
And the shaggy Nannie goat is calling, calling, calling,
    From her little trampled corner of the long wide lea
That stretches to the waters of the hill-stream falling
    Sheer upon the flat rocks joyously!
    There, oh, there! on the island of the sea,
        There I would be at dawn."
Innocence,"She tripped and fell against a star,
A lady we all have known;
Just what the villagers lusted for
To claim her one of their own;
Fallen but once the lower felt she,
So turned her face and died,—
With never a hounding fool to see
’Twas a star-lance in her side!
 "
Golgotha Is a Mountain,"Golgotha is a mountain, a purple mound
Almost out of sight.
One night they hanged two thieves there,
And another man.
Some women wept heavily that night;
Their tears are flowing still. They have made a river;
Once it covered me.
Then the people went away and left Golgotha
Deserted.
Oh, I’ve seen many mountains:
Pale purple mountains melting in the evening mists and blurring on the borders of the sky.
I climbed old Shasta and chilled my hands in its summer snows.
I rested in the shadow of Popocatepetl and it whispered to me of daring prowess.
I looked upon the Pyrenees and felt the zest of warm exotic nights.
I slept at the foot of Fujiyama and dreamed of legend and of death.
And I’ve seen other mountains rising from the wistful moors like the breasts of a slender maiden.
Who knows the mystery of mountains!
Some of them are awful, others are just lonely.
                                   *        *        *
Italy has its Rome and California has San Francisco,
All covered with mountains.
Some think these mountains grew
Like ant hills
Or sand dunes.
That might be so––
I wonder what started them all!
Babylon is a mountain
And so is Ninevah,
With grass growing on them;
Palaces and hanging gardens started them.
I wonder what is under the hills
In Mexico
And Japan!
There are mountains in Africa too.
Treasure is buried there:
Gold and precious stones
And moulded glory.
Lush grass is growing there
Sinking before the wind.
Black men are bowing.
Naked in that grass
Digging with their fingers.
I am one of them:
Those mountains should be ours.
It would be great
To touch the pieces of glory with our hands.
These mute unhappy hills,
Bowed down with broken backs,
Speak often one to another:
“A day is as a year,” they cry,
“And a thousand years as one day.”
We watched the caravan
That bore our queen to the courts of Solomon;
And when the first slave traders came
We bowed our hands.
“Oh, Brothers, it is not long!
Dust shall yet devour the stones
But we shall be here when they are gone.”
Mountains are rising all around me.
Some are so small they are not seen;
Others are large.
All of them get big in time and people forget
What started them at first.
Oh the world is covered with mountains!
Beneath each one there is something buried:
Some pile of wreckage that started it there.
Mountains are lonely and some are awful.
                                   *        *        *
One day I will crumble.
They’ll cover my heap with dirt and that will make a mountain.
I think it will be Golgotha."
Homing,"Sweet timber land
Where soft winds blow
The high green tree
And fan away the fog!
Ah fragrant stream
Where thirsty creatures go
And strong black men
Hew the heavy log!
Oh broken house
Crumbling there alone,
Wanting me!
Oh silent tree
Must I always be
A wild bird
Riding the wind
And screaming bitterly?"
"Life-Long, Poor Browning…","Life-long, poor Browning never knew Virginia,
Or he’d not grieved in Florence for April sallies
Back to English gardens after Euclid’s linear:
Clipt yews, Pomander Walks, and pleachéd alleys;
Primroses, prim indeed, in quite ordered hedges,
Waterways, soberly, sedately enchanneled,
No thin riotous blade even among the sedges,
All the wild country-side tamely impaneled…
Dead, now, dear Browning, lives on in heaven,—
(Heaven’s Virginia when the year’s at its Spring)
He’s haunting the byways of the wine-aired leaven
And throating the notes of the wildings on wing;
Here canopied reaches of dogwood and hazel,
Beech tree and redbud fine-laced in vines,
Fleet clapping rills by lush fern and basil,
Drain blue hills to lowlands scented with pines…
Think you he meets in this tender green sweetness
Shade that was Elizabeth… immortal completeness!
 "
Close Your Eyes!,"Go through the gates with closed eyes.
Stand erect and let your black face front the west.
Drop the axe and leave the timber where it lies;
A woodman on the hill must have his rest.
Go where leaves are lying brown and wet.
Forget her warm arms and her breast who mothered you,
And every face you ever loved forget.
Close your eyes; walk bravely through."
The Day-Breakers,"We are not come to wage a strife
    With swords upon this hill.
It is not wise to waste the life
    Against a stubborn will.
Yet would we die as some have done:
Beating a way for the rising sun."
A Tree Design,"A tree is more than a shadow
Blurred against the sky,
More than ink spilled on the fringe
Of white clouds floating by.
A tree is more than an April design
Or a blighted winter bough
Where love and music used to be.
A tree is something in me,
Very still and lonely now."
The Resurrection,"His friends went off and left Him dead
In Joseph’s subterranean bed,
Embalmed with myrrh and sweet aloes,
And wrapped in snow-white burial clothes.
Then shrewd men came and set a seal
Upon His grave, lest thieves should steal
His lifeless form away, and claim
For Him and undeserving fame.
“There is no use,” the soldiers said,
“Of standing sentries by the dead.”
Wherefore, they drew their cloaks around
Themselves, and fell upon the ground,
And slept like dead men, all night through,
In the pale moonlight and chilling dew.
A muffed whiff of sudden breath
Ruffled the passive air of death.
He woke, and raised Himself in bed;
    Recalled how He was crucified;
Touched both hands’ fingers to His head,
    And lightly felt His fresh-healed side.
Then with a deep, triumphant sigh,
He coolly put His grave-clothes by—
Folded the sweet, white winding sheet,
    The toweling, the linen bands,
    The napkin, all with careful hands—
And left the borrowed chamber neat.
His steps were like the breaking day:
    So soft across the watch He stole,
    He did not wake a single soul,
Nor spill one dewdrop by the way.
Now Calvary was loveliness:
    Lilies that flowered thereupon
Pulled off the white moon’s pallid dress,
    And put the morning’s vesture on.
“Why seek the living among the dead?
He is not here,” the angel said.
The early winds took up the words,
And bore them to the lilting birds,
The leafing trees, and everything
That breathed the living breath of spring."
Gethsemane,"All that night I walked alone and wept.
I tore a rose and dropped it on the ground.
My heart was lead; all that night I kept
Listening to hear a dreadful sound.
A tree bent down and dew dripped from its hair.
The earth was warm; dawn came solemnly.
I stretched full-length upon the grass and there
I said your name but silence answered me."
Lancelot,"The fruit of the orchard is over-ripe, Elaine,
And leaves are crisping on the garden wall.
Leaves on the garden path are wet and rain
Drips from the low shrubs with a steady fall.
It is long, so long since I was here, Elaine,
Moles have gnawed the rose tree at its root;
You did not think that I would come again,
Least of all in the day of falling fruit."
It Is Raining,"and a line of light is just beginning
to open the lid of the horizon.
Somebody leans out an upstairs window
and shouts, “Thanks for the beer.
Write when you get work.” A car
coughs, starts, moves down the street
avoiding the deeper puddles
stippled with rain. It passes a dog
in a doorway, his tail curled
carefully around his delicate feet.
It is raining in Coblenz and in Buda
and in Pest. It is raining
on the top and bottom of the world.
It is raining in Argentina. The bank vaults
are leaking. The German certificates
of deposit are beginning to mold.
It is raining on the gleaming seats 
of hundreds of parked bicycles.
It is raining for those who plan to go out
and for those who plan to stay in.
It is raining quietly, the rain of forever,
the rain of good-bye, the rain of tomorrow.
It is raining on horses who stand
on three feet in wet fields
and speak the language of every country.
It is raining on the mansion on the hill
with one small light from the kitchen
where the cook has a toothache and cannot sleep.
She sits playing solitaire, looking around
the empty room quickly, and cheating.
It is raining on the glistening tailings
from exhausted mines and on little
ghost towns in the mountains.
It is raining on the old house in the city
far away where we once lived another life.
It is raining wherever you are
and wherever I am and wherever
we are going and have been.
It is raining on the tombstones, on the flat
stones and the upright stones. It is raining
into the open graves that are waiting.
It is raining on history, on the battlefields
of long-lost wars
and the bronze statues of forgotten heroes.
It is raining on Alcatraz, in the fog,
where mushrooms are growing under steel bunks.
It is raining on millions of pale yellow
butterflies far out at sea, migrating
like angels from one world to another. 
 "
Corsage,"Mind’s residue is vein-violet
(old women with their stockings
hanging down)—gorged with
color and superb as light.
“The spangled riddle is twitter
and purr,” the mussels murmured. 
Then departed.
                      Of an evening,
in the empty park, sometimes I hear
the rustle of revival-meeting
pamphlets. Band music, with
surrealist trumpets, knifes the air.
Eagles with tusks perform in sieves.
The ectoplasm of Immanuel Kant unwittingly appears.
These bilious things, fracturing
the night’s surface, swerve
into graphs, hanging like crags in jagged lines:
—profound, perfect
and not without meaning."
Two Cities,"   Salt Lake
High spires of piety
No smoking on the grounds
Wide streets high wind
The hotel leaks orchestral sounds.
“Women and men pulled carts
Like oxen.” Liquor sold
By package only. All the night
Wind again rain and unexpected cold.
The lake continues to recede; the girls
Forsake the faith; the Mormon hours pass.
We dutifully examine Brigham Young’s
Gold inkwell (in a case of thumb-marked glass).
   San Francisco
Beside the bay, observers penetrate
Distance upon distance, cloud on cloud,
Crayons of smoke that sketch blue sky
With gray appeals. We pause, stretched side by side,
Safe for the moment from the nudging crowd,
Laughter for strangeness, and old myths crisping in the grate.
These trinkets, essences that we have saved,
Sheathed valuables that hold us here
Where gull-cry, wave-wash, dash of listening sea
Stir memory and love, are suddenly 
Minute survivors, permanent and clear. 
—We must go back. Your eyes are mirrors, strangely grave. "
Statement with Rhymes,"Plurality is all. I walk among the restaurants,
the theatres, the grocery stores; I ride the cars
and hear of Mrs. Bedford’s teeth and Albuquerque,
strikes unsettled, someone’s simply marvelous date,
news of the German Jews, the baseball scores,
storetalk and whoretalk, talk of wars. I turn
the pages of a thousand books to read
the names of Buddha, Malthus, Walker Evans, Stendhal, André Gide,
Ouspenski; note the terms: obscurantism,
factorize, fagaceous, endocarp; descend
the nervous stairs to hear the broken ends
of songs that float through city air.
In Osnabrück and Ogden, on the Passamaquoddy Bay,
in Ahmednagar, Waco (Neb.), in Santa Fé,
propelled by zeros, zinc, and zephyrs, always I’m pursued
by thoughts of what I am, authority, remembrance, food,
the letter on the mezzanine, the unemployed, dogs’ lonely
   faces, pianos and decay.
Plurality is all. I sympathize, but cannot grieve
too long for those who wear their dialectics on their sleeves.
The pattern’s one I sometimes rather like; there’s really nothing wrong
with it for some. But I should add: It doesn’t wear for long,
before I push the elevator bell and quickly leave.
 "
The Jungle Aflame,"Translated by George McWhirter

The saffron skies resemble tropical Turners.
The dancing palms are kissed by voracious tongues.
The howler monkeys leap from crest to crest.
Through the billows of smoke, companies of parrots
with singed tails go searching for the sun
that watches them covertly, like a putrid eye.
Selva Ardiendo

Los cielos amarillos parecen Turners tropicales.
Las palmeras danzantes son besadas por lenguas voraces.
Los monos aulladores saltan de copa en copa.
A través de las humaredas, bandadas de loros,
Con las colas quemadas, van buscando al sol,
que los mira oculto, como un ojo podrido. "
Subtitle,"       We present for you this evening
A movie of death: observe
These scenes chipped celluloid
Reveals unsponsored and tax-free.
      We request these things only:
All gum must be placed beneath the seats
Or swallowed quickly, all popcorn sacks
Must be left in the foyer. The doors
Will remain closed throughout
The performance. Kindly consult
Your programs: observe that
There are no exits. This is
A necessary precaution.
       Look for no dialogue, or for the
Sound of any human voice: we have seen fit
To synchronize this play with
Squealings of pigs, slow sound of guns,
The sharp dead click
Of empty chocolatebar machines.
We say again: there are
No exits here, no guards to bribe,
No washroom windows.
      No finis to the film unless
The ending is your own.
Turn off the lights, remind
The operator of his union card:
Sit forward, let the screen reveal
Your heritage, the logic of your destiny."
Substitution,"Is Life itself but many ways of thought,
Does thinking furl the poets’ pleiades,
Is in His slightest convolution wrought
These mantled worlds and their men-freighted seas?
He thinks—and being comes to ardent things:
The splendor of the day-spent sun, love’s birth,—
Or dreams a little, while creation swings
The circle of His mind and Time’s full girth . . .
As here within this noisy peopled room
My thought leans forward . . . quick! you’re lifted clear
Of brick and frame to moonlit garden bloom,—
Absurdly easy, now, our walking, dear,
Talking, my leaning close to touch your face . . .
His All-Mind bids us keep this sacred place!"
Kink,"The moon assumes her voyeuristic perch
to find the rut of me, releashed from sense,
devoid of focus ’cept by your design.
I never thought restraint would be my thing.
Then you: the hole from which my logic seeps,
who bucks my mind’s incessant swallowsong
& pins the speaker’s squirming lyric down
with ease. You coax a measured flood, decide
the scatter of my breath & know your place—
astride the August heat, your knuckles tight
around a bratty vers, a fuschia gag:
you quiet my neurotic ass, can still
the loudness murmuring beneath my skull.
Be done. There’s nothing more to say."
"Brown Estate, 2018 Tempranillo","Violence thrives like violet on the vine, but I’m rare
today, with you. I came to Napa nappy-headed,
impressively unconcerned, with heft to me. Air
kisses the wine we bring to lip: I’m not wedded
to folks, I say, the way I was. Parts of me have died
with more to expire; troubled times have changed
us both. Left to silence, a question rises—if you lied
to spare me wrath turned inward. You’ve arranged
any moment of peace I’ve ever lived in: Love, it’s hard
to trust a good thing these days, harder still to be one.
Crimson colors in our stemmed glasses. Sorry-ass bard,
feeling no ounce of romance toward the world. No gun
could woo me, though. I want to be here. Need to be—
me, the half-full fool of us. I can’t imagine what you see."
black love,"my love is black though my love is not black ::
think the darkness cradling the milky way ::

of my throat, glowing—i swallow the day ::
my love is black, an absorbing array
of colors :: gold yolk escaping the cracked
shell :: a shiny silver moon-coin to play ::
a juicy peach, plump plums, cup of cognac ::
my love is black, the only way i know
to live :: now fierce and demanding, now free
and unpossessed :: so for my magnet, my
love becomes steel, then, for my butterfly,

This Beautiful Planet,"Please tell me that I was a good child
And that I did everything right
And that the atmosphere was exactly certain
I want you to love me
In ways that you never have
So that I become a forgotten world
With rainbow sunrises over dark green trees
And the cooling of the day
Becomes normal again
We will sit and watch the body of water
That we once called a sort of death
You know even in my dreams
You say I’ll never get it right
This is not a dream
We are burning here with no escape
But no matter how many times
They talk about the moon
It does not take a poet
To know that the moon
Is still only an illusion
Only an illusion
The moon calls out to all of us
Come back, it says
But we don’t hear it
Already on our way
To somewhere"
"October XXIX, 1795","Keats’ Birthday
Time sitting on the throne of Memory
Bade all her subject Days, the past had known
Arise and say what thing gave them renown
Unforgetable, ‘Rising from the sea,
I gave the Genoese his dream to be;’
‘I saw the Corsican’s Guards swept down;’
‘Colonies I made free from a tyrant’s crown;’—
So each Day told its immortality.
And with these blazing triumphs spoke one voice
Whose wistful speech no vaunting did employ:
‘I know not if ’twere by Fate’s chance or choice
I hold the lowly birth of an English boy;
I only know he made man’s heart rejoice
Because he played with Beauty for a toy!’"
Rye Bread,"Father John’s bread was made of rye,
Felicite’s bread was white;
Father John loved the sun noon-high,
Felicite, the moon at night.
Father John drank wine with his bread;
Felicite drank sweet milk;
Father John loved flowers, pungent and red;
Felicite, lilies soft as silk.
Father John’s soul was made of bronze,
That God’s salt was corroding;
Felicite’s soul was a wind that runs
With a blue flame of foreboding.
Between these two was the shadow of a dome
That cut their lives in twain;
But Dionysus led them home,
In a chariot of pain."
From the German of Uhland,"translated from the German by James Weldon Johnson
Three students once tarried over the Rhine,
And into Frau Wirthin’s turned to dine.

“Say, hostess, have you good beer and wine?
And where is that pretty daughter of thine?”

“My beer and wine is fresh and clear.
My daughter lies on her funeral bier.”

They softly tipped into the room;
She lay there in the silent gloom.

The first the white cloth gently raised,
And tearfully upon her gazed.

“If thou wert alive, O, lovely maid,
My heart at thy feet would to-day be laid!”

The second covered her face again,
And turned away with grief and pain.

“Ah, thou upon thy snow-white bier!
And I have loved thee so many a year.”

The third drew back again the veil,
And kissed the lips so cold and pale.

“I’ve loved thee always, I love thee to-day,
And will love thee, yes, forever and aye!”
    Der Wirthin Töchterlein
  Es zogen drei Bursche wohl über den Rhein,
Bei einer Frau Wirthin, da kehrten sie ein.

„Frau Wirthin! hat Sie gut Bier und Wein?
Wo hat Sie Ihr schönes Töchterlein?“

„Mein Bier und Wein ist frisch und klar,
Mein Töchterlein liegt auf der Todtenbahr.“

Und als sie traten zur Kammer hinein,
Da lag sie in einem schwarzen Schrein.

Der erste, der schlug den Schleier zurück
Und schaute sie an mit traurigem Blick:

„Ach! lebtest du noch, du schöne Maid!
Ich würde dich lieben von dieser Zeit.“

Der zweite deckte den Schleier zu,
Und kehrte sich ab, und weinte dazu:

„Ach! daß du liegst auf der Todtenbahr!
Ich hab’ dich geliebet so manches Jahr.“

Der dritte hub ihn wieder sogleich
Und küßte sie an den Mund so bleich:

„Dich liebt’ ich immer, dich lieb’ ich noch heut,
Und werde dich lieben in Ewigkeit.“"
The Way-Side Well,"A fancy halts my feet at the way-side well.
It is not to drink, for they say the water is brackish.
It is not to tryst, for a heart at the mile’s end beckons me on.
It is not to rest, for what feet could be weary when a heart at the mile’s end keeps time with their tread?
It is not to muse for the heart at the mile’s end is food for my being.
I will question the well for my secret by dropping a pebble into it.
Ah, it is dry.
Strike lightning to the road, my feet, for hearts are like wells.
You may not know they are dry ’til you question their depths.
Fancies clog the way to heaven, and saints miss their crown."
an armistice between my dead folks and my delusions,"I am a body
of ghost—
haint-kin cloaked
in earthen flesh
learning to see
my Self 
in the unyielding 
barrenness of my mother’s 
front yard.
The salted fault lines
become me. I bear
a trace of invasion
and reek
of a martyr’s will.
A tangle
of medicinal weeds
interrupts my molting 
descent.
Dandelion greens fuzz
up my apathy. A flower
dares itself to bloom
amongst my most quiet
scars.
When the rain comes,
I turn mud in my lover’s mouth.
Something fecund hums
through my blood
And maybe . . . this 
is the living. These 
would-be dead things in
the same place, the same time

my body. Ours. Not mine— 
unowned and fruited and

The Tragedy of Pete,"There was a man
   Whose name was Pete,
And he was a buck
   From his head to his feet.

He loved a dollar,
   But hated a dime;
And so was poor
   Nine-tenths of the time.

The Judge said “Pete,
   What of your wife?”
And Pete replied
   “She lost her life.”

“Pete,” said the Judge,
   “Was it lost in a row?
Tell me quick,
   And tell me how.”

Pete straightened up
   With a hic and a sigh,
Then looked the Judge
   Full in the eye.

“O, Judge, my wife
   Would never go
To a Sunday dance
   Or a movie show.

“But I went, Judge,
   Both day and night,
And came home broke
   And also tight.

“The moon was up,
   My purse was down,
And I was the bully
   Of the bootleg town.

“I was crooning a lilt
   To corn and rye
For the loop in my legs
   And the fight in my eye.

“I met my wife;
   She was wearing a frown,
And catechising
   Her Sunday gown.

‘O Pete, O Pete’
   She cried aloud,
‘The Devil is falling
   Right out of a cloud.’

“I looked straight up
   And fell flat down
And a Ford machine
   Pinned my head to the ground.

“The Ford moved on,
   And my wife was in it;
And I was sober,
   That very minute.

“For my head was bleeding,
   My heart was a-flutter;
And the moonshine within me
   Was tipping the gutter.

“The Ford, it faster
   And faster sped
Till it dipped and swerved
   And my wife was dead.

“Two bruised men lay
   In a hospital ward   
One seeking vengeance,
   The other the Lord.

“He said to me:
   ‘Your wife was drunk,
You are crazy,
   And my Ford is junk.’

“I raised my knife
   And drove it in
At the top of his head
   And the point of his chin.

“O Judge, O Judge,
   If the State has a chair,
Please bind me in it
   And roast me there.”

There was a man
   Whose name was Pete,
And he welcomed death
   From his head to his feet."
X Rays,"Your eyes were gem-like in that dim deep chamber
Hushed and sombre with imprisoned fire,
With yellow ghostly globes of intense aether
Potent as the rays of pure desire.
Your voice was startled into vivid wonder,
When the winged wild whining mystic wheel
Took flight and shot the dark with frosty crashings
Like an ice-berg splitting to the keel.
Your flesh was never warmer to my passion
Than when, moving in that lumor green,
We saw with eyes our fragile bones enamoured
Clasping sadly on the pallid screen.
You seemed so virginal and so undreaming
Of the burning hunger in my eyes,
To peer more fever-deeply in your being
Than the very death of passion lies.
The subtle-tuned shy motions of your spirit,
Fashioned through the ages for the sun,
Were dumb in that green lustre-haunted cavern
Where you walked a naked skeleton;
Slim-hipped and fluent and of lovely motion,
Living to the tip of every bone,
And ah, too exquisitely vivid-moving
Ever to lie wanly down alone—
To lie forever down so still and slender,
Tracing on the ancient screen of night
That naked and pale writing of the wonder
Of your beauty breathing in the light."
From the Stone Age,"Long ago some one carved me in the semblance of a god.
I have forgot now what god I was meant to represent.
I have no consciousness now but of stone, sunlight, and rain;
The sun baking my skin of stone, the wind lifting my hair;
The sun’s light is hot upon me,
The moon’s light is cool,
Casting a silver-laced pattern of light and dark
Over the planes of my body:
My thoughts now are the thoughts of a stone,
My substance now is the substance of life itself;
I have sunk deep into life as one sinks into sleep;
Life is above me, below me, around me, 
Moving through my pores of stone—
It does not matter how small the space you pack life in,
That space is as big as the universe—
Space, volume, and the overtone of volume
Move through me like chords of music,
Like the taste of happiness in the throat,
Which you fear to lose, though it may choke you—
(In the cities this is not known,
For space there is emptiness,
And time is torment) . . . . .
Since I became a stone
I have no need to remember anything—
Everything is remembered for me;
I live and I think and I dream as a stone,
In the warm sunlight, in the grey rain;
All my surfaces are touched to softness
By the light fingers of the wind,
The slow dripping of rain:
My body retains only faintly the image
It was meant to represent,
I am more beautiful and less rigid,
I am a part of space,
Time has entered into me,
Life has passed through me—
What matter the name of the god I was meant to represent?"
I Have a Friend,"    I have a friend
And my heart from hence
Is closed to friendship,
Nor the gods’ knees hold but one;
He watches with me thru the long night,
And when I call he comes,
Or when he calls I am there;
He does not ask me how beloved
Are my husband and children,
Nor ever do I require
Details of life and love
In the grave—his home,—
    We are such friends."
Neighbors,"Ah, you are cruel;
You ask too much;
Offered a hand, a finger-tip,
You must have a soul to clutch."
Dusk,"Twin stars through my purpling pane,
    The shriveling husk
Of a yellowing moon on the wane—
    And the dusk."
For the Candlelight,"The sky was blue, so blue that day
    And each daisy white, so white,
O, I knew that no more could rains fall grey
    And night again be night.
                    . . . . .                    
I knew, I knew.   Well, if night is night,
    And the grey skies greyly cry,
I have in a book for the candle light,
    A daisy dead and dry."
The Marathon Runner,"If I have run my course and seek the pearls
My Psyche fain would drink at Mermelon
And rest content in wine and nectar cup
Who knows but that the gods have found me whole
And in their stewardship of man would bless
The sweating lover fickle man once knew?
I know that I might pull the tendon bands
That hold my soul together—ay, might bend
Each nerve and muscle spirit fain would keep—
That I might hear the maddening cheers of men
Who when the morrow dawns forget the games
And cast instead the dice in market place.
But I have found sweeter peace than fame;
And in the evening dwell on heights divine,
Betwixt my lips a rose from Cupid’s hands,
Upon my brow the laurel Belvidere
Entwines from tree beside the throne of Zeus
And flowing from my speech Athene’s words
Dipped long in wisdom’s fount to heal the soul."
Puck Goes to Court,"I went to court last night,
Before me firefly light;
And there was Lady Mab,
On cheek a cunning dab
Of rouge the sun sent down,
King Oberon with crown
Of gold eyed daisy buds
Among potato spuds
Was dancing roundelay
With Lady Chloe and May.
I hid among the flowers
And spent the wee young hours
In mixing up the punch;
For I was on a hunch
That sober men are dull
And fairy dust will lull
To rest the plodding mind
Word down by life’s thick grind.
The nobles drank the brew
And called it sweetest dew;
But when I left they lay
Stunned by the light of day
And Oberon had writ
Decree that I must flit
A hundred leagues from court.
(Alas!   Where is there sport?)"
When I Die,"When I die my song shall be
Crooning of the summer breeze;
When I die my shroud shall be
Leaves plucked from the maple trees;
On a couch as green as moss
And a bed as soft as down
I shall sleep and dream my dream
Of a poet’s laurel crown.
When I die my star shall drop
Singing like a nightingale;
When I die my soul shall rise
Where the lyre-strings never fail;
In the rose my blood shall lie,
In the violet the smile,
And the moonbeams thousand strong
Past my grave each night shall file."
Devonport,"The man has chosen
that he wants his ashes scattered
from the end of the pier
where he used to fish with his buddies.
They’d sit on overturned paint buckets.
Sometimes the waves gusted up
and the hems of his pants got wet and salty.
He liked the gulls that stood on the railing,
all puffed up with sky.
Having made the decision,
he walks at dusk to the end of the pier
and looks out at the sea.
As he turns away, he sometimes gives
a small, happy nod, like a man
thinking yes, I will buy this house."
our own names,"okra, pickled just the way you like it,
             in the jar on the top shelf. oranges
in the ochre clay bowl you made right there
on the counter. clove tea brewing stovetop

taught me, metronoming ’gainst my orbital
bones. orbiting around my occipital.

to you, the people, my folks, my kindred—
             not to the state. & i belong with you—

gathered together here in our own names

After Striving,"I think of my father’s one-room woodshop,
how his business sign eventually blew over
beside apple trees and blueberry bushes.
At church, men would ask, Staying busy?
He hated that question, and kept adding logs
to the stove and sanding doors.
There was a time I’d stare at the grass in September
and not think about the push mower.
When work is over, I find his skin. His hips
metronome while rinsing plates like it’s joy
he’s practicing. We relearn simple math like dance,
because how long have we been striving
and what has work numbed?"
"Dearly Departed, Again I Dreamt About a Ship","When a mouth aboard said ship
called out to me, I was a berry
turned sour by sun’s
neglect, an old ornament gone
unglossed. It spoke to me & warranted
a new way of listening & at once
I heard two crows, heard both.
For years, that strange whistle
of new language nettled me sloppily
its orientation unmapped. I let it
holler too long untended, & after
too long an ignorance it came back
to beat me, a bullet of tenacity.
I took too long to know its nature
& now I count a debt. It takes
exactly this much effort to tell you
that I have been stayed. Stayed by
a new forgetfulness, stayed by
an urgent condition, a mother warbler
feeding me melons by the whole.
Is there a mouth as hungry
as mine? As wide in its receiving?
I open to a 30th orbit
& want for nothing more than the syrup
of fruit, than the blade of a garden
in the small of my back, than to bait
the braid of duty.
& so, for this wily bewitched reason
of little perspicuity
I regret to inform you of my imminent
departure, my eventual, divine
escape from cog-wheel
mandates, my prescriptions grown old.
What I love is a heaven
that vexes me—& to it I must become
a faithful wife."
People to Run From,"After dinner, I’m mailed back to my father in a suitcase.
The tablecloth is edible. Gold is edible. God is edible too.
Don’t believe the words on the table—they’re not food.
I’m worried someone will walk in and take my plate away.
The men I grew up with ate white rice burritos.
Sometimes the stars feel nearby. Sometimes they write.
When my parents fought about rent, the ends of my body came and went.
My father climbs out of my body at night in search of gold chains
He can pawn at Don Roberto Jewelers.
At some point, a pattern will emerge—at some point, all of it will make sense.
A vast table, laid out with fruits, vegetables, and smoked meats.
Gold is edible. Fathers are edible too.
Mom makes a list of chores for my brother and I to avoid being slapped
Or asked to assume the position from across the room.
We are nuisances, embarrassments, party-squatters to teenage parents.
At my cousin’s wedding: birria, red rice and potato salad.
Then into the bathroom—I go.
I try but can’t stop putting certain things inside me.
For a long time, I thought all girls were disciplined this way,
Thrown into the dark to reckon with thoughts.
He told me the vein inside had broken—put that in my book.

Ars Poetica,
Confession,"If for a day joy masters me,
Think not my wounds are healed;
Far deeper than the scars you see,
I keep the roots concealed.
They shall bear blossoms with the fall;
I have their word for this,
Who tend my roots with rains of gall,
And suns of prejudice."
Behind Stowe,"I heard an elf go whistling by,
A whistle sleek as moonlit grass,
That drew me like a silver string
To where the dusty, pale moths fly,
And make a magic as they pass;
And there I heard a cricket sing.
His singing echoed through and through
The dark under a windy tree
Where glinted little insects’ wings.
His singing split the sky in two.
The halves fell either side of me,
And I stood straight, bright with moon-rings."
Remembering Our First Parties,"remembering the boys—
much older, only unsettling
in hindsight
back then, they gave us
beers and we took them,
uncertain in the summer
of sage and honey.
we hid in the bathroom
so we could talk
for a while, swimming in the empty
bathtub and watching each
other’s reflections in the mirror.
the boys waited outside
in the yard, and we let them
wait while we were fifteen
and silver-tongued, all shoulder-
blades and hummingbird and safe
for now"
Sikasso Snow,"never thought I
would see it here
in this Otherwhere,
no plantation in sight
no patterned pods
for the picking,
nor calloused hands
to plow & gin
an untouched December
bluff surrounded by scrubs of green
blowing along
a dust-whipped road heading south
toward no one’s harvest."
Praise Song,"After she died, I’d catch her
stuffing my nose with pine needles and oak,
staring off into the shadows of early morning.
Me, too jetlagged for the smells a ghost leaves behind.
The tailor of histories,
my mother sewed our Black Barbies and Kens
Nigerian clothes, her mind so tight against
the stitching, that in precision, she looked mean
as hell, too. My mother’s laugh was a record skipping,
so deep she left nicks in the vinyl.
See? Even in death, she wants to be fable.
I don’t know what fathers teach sons,
but I am moving my mother
to a land where grief is no longer
gruesome. She loved top 40, yacht rock,
driving in daylight with the wind
wa-wa-ing through her cracked window
like Allah blowing breath
over the open bottle neck of our living.
She knew ninety-nine names for God,
and yet how do I remember her—
as what no god could make?"
Everything is Exactly the Same as it Was the Day Before,"New Year on my mountain

make a lot of noise! so the children
bang on pots & pans to hush
yesterday’s demons. later, in the cold,
the family plods up the hill to wonder
at the fireworks, sky like a warzone lit
with spraying flames from Roman Candles—
fire on the ground from Watusi whips snaking
& coiling, sizzling our feet.
I feel it all in my chest—
a drumming,
a warning, a spell.
back in the yard, granny doles out rice
& meat, pineapple liquor, glass bottles
of Sprite. but I am snoring by midnight,
my sisters & I still swathed in red chiffon.

Dance,"Moon dance,
you were not to blame.
Nor you,
lovely white moth.
But I saw you together."
Star Ledger,"Almost time to dress for the sun's total eclipse
   so the child pastes one last face
in her album of movie stars – Myrna Loy
   and Olivia de Havilland – names meant to conjure
sultry nights, voluptuous turns across
   some dance floor borne on clouds. Jean Harlow.
Clipped from the Newark evening paper, whole galaxies
   of splendid starlets gaze, fixed to violet pages
spread drying on the kitchen table. The child whispers
   their names when she tests “lorgnettes”
made that morning out of shirtboards, old film
   negatives gleaned from her grandmother’s hat box.
Through phony opera glasses, hall lights blur
   stained sepia above her, and her grandmother’s
room is stained by a tall oak’s crown, yellow
   in the window. Acorns crack against asphalt
three floors down. The paper promised
   “a rare conjunction of sun and moon and earth.”
Her grandmother brushed thick gray hair.
   Cut glass bottles and jewel cases.
Above the corset her back was soft, black moles
   she called her “melanomas” dusted across
powdery skin like a night sky, inside out.
   The Spanish fan dangles from her wrist
and when she stands she looks like an actress
   from the late-night movies. The child sifts
costume brooches, glass rubies and sapphires,
   to find the dark gold snake ring with emerald chips
for eyes. She carries the miniature hourglass
   to the sagging porch, then waiting turns it over
and over. Uncertain in high heels, she teeters
   and the shawl draped flamenco-style keeps sliding off
her shoulder, so she glances up the block to Girl Scouts
   reeling down the flag. The child hates their dull uniforms,
how they scatter shrieking through leafsmoke and the sheen
   of fallen chestnuts. She touches the ring, heavy
on a ribbon circling her neck, then thinks she’ll sew
   the album pages with green embroidery silk.
Her grandmother snaps the fan and they raise lorgnettes
   to the sun’s charcoaled face, its thin wreath
of fire. Quiet, the Girl Scouts bow their heads – sleek
   Italian ones and black girls with myriad tight braids.
Streetlights hum on, then the towers of Manhattan flare
   beyond the river. The earth must carve its grave ellipse
through desert space, through years and histories
   before it will cross with sun and moon this way again.
Minor starlets in the child’s album will fade and tatter,
   fleeting constellations with names flimsy as
the shawl that wraps her shoulders. She’ll remember this
   as foolish. The girls by the flag will mostly leave
for lives of poverty, crippled dreams, and Newark
   will collapse to burn like another dying star.
But none of this has happened. Afternoon has stilled
   with the eclipse that strips them of their shadows,
so each one stands within their own brief human orbit
   while the world reverses, then slowly, recovers."

The Forest Road,"The forest road,
The infinite straight road stretching away
World without end: the breathless road between the walls
Of the black listening trees: the hushed, grey road
Beyond the window that you shut to-night
Crying that you would look at it by day—
There is a shadow there that sings and calls
But not for you. Oh! hidden eyes that plead in sleep
Against the lonely dark, if I could touch the fear
And leave it kissed away on quiet lids—
If I could hush these hands that are half-awake,
Groping for me in sleep I could go free.
I wish that God would take them out of mine
And fold them like the wings of frightened birds
Shot cruelly down, but fluttering into quietness so soon.
Broken, forgotten things; there is no grief for them in the green Spring
When the new birds fly back to the old trees.
But it shall not be so with you. I will look back. I wish I knew that God would stand
Smiling and looking down on you when morning comes,
To hold you, when you wake, closer than I,
So gently though: and not with famished lips or hungry arms:
He does not hurt the frailest, dearest things
As we do in the dark. See, dear, your hair—
I must unloose this hair that sleeps and dreams
About my face, and clings like the brown weed
To drowned, delivered things, tossed by the tired sea
Back to the beaches. Oh! your hair! If you had lain
A long time dead on the rough, glistening ledge
Of some black cliff, forgotten by the tide,
The raving winds would tear, the dripping brine would rust away
Fold after fold of all the loveliness
That wraps you round, and makes you, lying here,
The passionate fragrance that the roses are.
But death would spare the glory of your head
In the long sweetness of the hair that does not die:
The spray would leap to it in every storm,
The scent of the unsilenced sea would linger on
In these dark waves, and round the silence that was you—
Only the nesting gulls would hear—but there would still be whispers in your hair;
Keep them for me; keep them for me. What is this singing on the road
That makes all other music like the music in a dream—
Dumb to the dancing and the marching feet; you know, in dreams, you see
Old pipers playing that you cannot hear,
And ghostly drums that only seem to beat. This seems to climb:
Is it the music of a larger place? It makes our room too small: it is like a stair,
A calling stair that climbs up to a smile you scarcely see,
Dim, but so waited for; and you know what a smile is, how it calls,
How if I smiled you always ran to me.
Now you must sleep forgetfully, as children do.
There is a Spirit sits by us in sleep
Nearer than those who walk with us in the bright day.
I think he has a tranquil, saving face: I think he came
Straight from the hills: he may have suffered there in time gone by,
And once, from those forsaken heights, looked down,
Lonely himself, on all the lonely sorrows of the earth.
It is his kingdom—Sleep. If I could leave you there—
If, without waking you, I could get up and reach the door—!
We used to go together.—Shut, scared eyes,
Poor, desolate, desperate hands, it is not I
Who thrust you off. No, take your hands away—
I cannot strike your lonely hands. Yes, I have struck your heart,
It did not come so near. Then lie you there
Dear and wild heart behind this quivering snow
With two red stains on it: and I will strike and tear
Mine out, and scatter it to yours. Oh! throbbing dust,
You that were life, our little wind-blown hearts!
                              The road! the road!
There is a shadow there: I see my soul,
I hear my soul, singing among the trees!"
Whipping,"Cord or twine used to bind 
or cover a rope, keep the ends
from fraying. To begin, 
place a hand 
on your daughter’s shoulders.
Tell her fifth grade is 
a bloodletting.
Show her your own path
of hard turns taken
before you were hauled taut
and loosed into motherhood.
Say, this knot 
is a folded note. 
This knot is a map
back to me. Lay out a rope.
Tell her to gather each end.
Say stitch them tight
or burn them down."
Castnet Seafood,"for Uncle Kenny and Cousin Jeremy
According to the local news station,
the blue crawfish is a rare thing to find,
yet it watches us from the tank of the market,
spared from a boiled, seasoned death
unlike its red friends. My uncle says joy
is the opposite of running
into a dagger, and I realize I am not
the most poetic family member
who has pain. J and I crack the spines of
the crawfish not lucky enough to be blue.
The deeper the blues, The more I see
black played above my head at the chiropractor
the day before. Stubborn I call my back,
subluxation the medical journal says.
Three times a week, my chiropractor
calls the forceful moving of my misalignment
a healthy crack. Like bullies hemorrhaging
power, we look forward to making me
almost break. I love my family, unlike my back.
Before we got here, J threaded amber and jade
and lapis into a necklace he made for me
to match the cover of the book where I’ve written
my pain. He moves, outside his box, newly freed.
He loves movement, says he understands 
that toxic masculinity means to want 
to pinch your claws around any smaller crustation.
I am the third most poetic in this family. He loves 
the neon of the crawfish. We google what makes it 
blue and we suck the sadness out of our conversation.
Like luck, blues can spare any life if you wear
it, but it will leave you as lonely as the crawfish
in the tank. I wonder what family the mudbug
came from. Were they a proud bunch? Had the brightest
shells in their swamp? Did this little blue bug love 
his looks, or did he burrow deeper into the mud 
because he couldn’t handle the attention his hue 
attracted? We chew the back meat of the unlucky things,
stew in the love that surrounds us like a pot with our
spines and heads still attached. Look at what the
brain makes the muscle do: remember. 
Joy is the membrane covering us, the tissue that keeps
a family situated around a table when they could
be running from one another. My uncle taps the murky
glass to make the orphaned thing move. He turns to us:
Could you imagine us living like that? 
All hard on the outside with an exoskeleton? 
No, no I can’t. There’s so much
in us. We’d fall apart."
Materials for a Gravestone Rubbing,"I have long wanted to be starlight in spring
and the late snow that lingers there, coming down
at Harpers Ferry over the river or gathered 
on a windowsill on third street in Brooklyn 
when I was twenty-two—the potpourri 
of sky the wind carries after a storm. 
The gray darkening on a far ridge. If you are reading this
there is still a way. I can take your smooth palm in mine
and lead you toward a distant city and a night
when you were on the mountain and dreaming of the other world
and we can walk together past the pre-war homes 
converted now to low-rent apartments for college students
or workers come in from long days on a road crew,
coveralls draped over the backs of kitchen chairs
and the light swaying just so. We can go on—
along the cracked sidewalks above the train tracks
that can’t exist again even as the grasses come up between them
and look through a fog and a single pair of headlights
making definite beams in the material cold. 
No moonlight to get netted up in on the surface of the water
no traffic at this hour just the scraps of paper blown
into gutters and the electric hum of streetlights,
a few voices, which almost walk like footfall down alleys
overgrown with briars and creeping vines, their crude
latticework against the brick and the exhale
of a bartender on a smoke break and the smoke
which still drifts. Now it must be all worn through
but then it was barely remarkable though I stop
to look back at the homes and at snow melt on roads
the flat glitter on the black road, the moiré pattern 
yet to be captured by language—and for a minute believe
in something as my stepfather believed in the smell of fire
whenever he left in the middle of the night
and returned before dawn and spoke to no one, didn’t
wake anyone up. Sometimes I feel that alone, 
that pure, as if looking back at myself
through the scrim of time and you are there 
standing in our kitchen at this hour and I can almost 
hear you and the first singing caught-up there in the back 
of your throat. Lately I’ve stopped worrying about the end. 
Each day my hand is smaller on your shoulders. New birds
still return and the hillsides green all around, the stars 
have traveled over the horizon and in the blink 
of an eye you are here—grape-vine charcoal in your hand;
little hyphen I have become."
"I’m Not Faking My Astonishment, Honest","Looking out over the cliff, we’re overwhelmed
by a sky that seems to heap danger upon us. We
end up staring at a single white fluff in the air—
feather, fur, dandelion puff—we don’t care
to define it. The relief of having something
to focus our attention. At home, our patio furniture
unscrews itself under the usual sun. On this trip—
well, I’m not any sadder, I just have more space
for my sadness to fill. I don’t want to give
particulars. A woman huffing up the trail behind
us says to her hiking partner, It wasn’t my size,
but it was only 9 dollars. And now all I want
is to see what it is. The future refuses
to happen, so where else should I turn?"
Winter Remembered,"Two evils, monstrous either one apart,
Possessed me, and were long and loath at going:
A cry of Absence, Absence, in the heart,
And in the wood the furious winter blowing.
Think not, when fire was bright upon my bricks
And past the tight boards hardly a wind could enter,
I glowed like them, the simple burning sticks,
Far from my cause, my proper heat, my center.
Better to walk forth in the murderous air
And wash my wound in the snows; that would be healing,
Because my heart would throb less painful there,
Being caked with cold, and past the smart of feeling.
Which would you choose, and for what boot in gold,
The absence, or the absence and the cold?"
Tav: ת,
The Death of the Old Year,"Full knee-deep lies the winter snow,
And the winter winds are wearily sighing:
Toll ye the church bell sad and slow,
And tread softly and speak low,
For the old year lies a-dying.
       Old year you must not die;
       You came to us so readily,
       You lived with us so steadily,
       Old year, you shall not die.
He lieth still: he doth not move:
He will not see the dawn of day.
He hath no other life above.
He gave me a friend and a true truelove
And the New-year will take ’em away.
       Old year you must not go;
       So long you have been with us,
       Such joy as you have seen with us,
       Old year, you shall not go.
He froth’d his bumpers to the brim;
A jollier year we shall not see.
But tho’ his eyes are waxing dim,
And tho’ his foes speak ill of him,
He was a friend to me.
       Old year, you shall not die;
       We did so laugh and cry with you,
       I’ve half a mind to die with you,
       Old year, if you must die.
He was full of joke and jest,
But all his merry quips are o’er.
To see him die across the waste
His son and heir doth ride post-haste,
But he’ll be dead before.
       Every one for his own.
       The night is starry and cold, my friend,
       And the New-year blithe and bold, my friend,
       Comes up to take his own.
How hard he breathes! over the snow
I heard just now the crowing cock.
The shadows flicker to and fro:
The cricket chirps: the light burns low:
’Tis nearly twelve o’clock.
       Shake hands, before you die.
       Old year, we’ll dearly rue for you:
       What is it we can do for you?
       Speak out before you die.
His face is growing sharp and thin.
Alack! our friend is gone,
Close up his eyes: tie up his chin:
Step from the corpse, and let him in
That standeth there alone,
       And waiteth at the door.
       There’s a new foot on the floor, my friend,
       And a new face at the door, my friend,
       A new face at the door."
A Gull Goes Up,"Gulls when they fly move in a liquid arc,
Still head, and wings that bend above the breast, 
Covering its glitter with a cloak of dark,
Gulls fly. So as at last toward balm and rest, 
Remembering wings, the desperate leave their earth, 
Bear from their earth what there was ruinous-crossed,
Peace from distress, and love from nothing-worth, 
Fast at the heart, its jewels of dear cost.
Gulls go up hushed to that entrancing flight,
With never a feather of all the body stirred.
So in an air less rare than longing might 
The dream of flying lift a marble bird.
Desire it is that flies; then wings are freight 
That only bear the feathered heart no weight."

To the Young Second Lieutenant Standing Behind Me in Line,"at the Keesler AFB Post Exchange in 1987 (Biloxi, Mississippi)
No one looked after me or my brother back then, no CPS, 
no Social Workers, the SP’s couldn’t be trusted,
the off-base cops even worse.
When the P-EX mini-mart clerk told me
I wasn’t supposed to be there
and had to leave my Pork & Beans
and bread on the counter, you caught up to me in the parking lot,
my items in your tote bag.
I got caught stealing a sleeved stick of butter
the week prior, but today had returned
with the Susan B. Anthony dollar coin I found in the gutter.
All I had was that and my pocketknife for opening cans and gutting fish,

the reason my privileges were revoked.
I wish I had answered your questions—What’s going on?
Why can’t you shop here? Where are your parents?
before darting off into the night with the can and bread,
dropping the piece of money at your feet."
Elastic Love Contrapuntal,"“The subject of lesbianism is very ordinary;”

            moon rays rebound lake ripples to eggplant purple walls

            smaller than weeks prior. She knows you prefer protruding hip bones,

I Went Out to Hear,"The sound of quiet. The sky 
indigo, steeping 
deeper from the top, like tea.
In the absence
of anything else, my own
breathing became obscene.
I heard the beating
of bats’ wings before 
the air troubled above 
my head, turned to look
and saw them gone.
On the surface of the black
lake, a swan and the moon
stayed perfectly 
still. I knew this was
a perfect moment.
Which would only hurt me
to remember and never
live again. My God. How lucky to have lived
a life I would die for."
The Need Is So Great,"Sometimes I just sit like this at the window and watch
the darkness come. If I’m smart, I’ll put on Bach.
I’m thinking now of how far it always seems there is to go.
Maybe it is too easy that I speak so often
of late last light on a December day,
of that stubborn grass that somehow still remains green
behind the broken chain link fence on the corner.
But the need is so great for the way light looks
as it takes its leave of us. We say
what we can to each other of these things,
we who are such thieves, stealing first
one breath and then the next. Bach, keep going
just this slowly, show me the way to believe
that what matters in this world has already happened
and will go on happening forever.
The way light falls on the last
of the stricken leaves of the copper beech
at the end of the block is something to behold."

New Year’s Chimes,"What is the song the stars sing?
    (And a million songs are as song of one.)
This is the song the stars sing:
    Sweeter song’s none.
One to set, and many to sing,
    (And a million songs are as song of one),
One to stand, and many to cling,
The many things, and the one Thing,
    The one that runs not, the many that run.
The ever new weaveth the ever old
    (And a million songs are as song of one)
Ever telling the never told;
The silver saith, and the said is gold,
    And done ever the never done.
The chase that’s chased is the Lord o’ the chase
(And a million songs are as song of one),
And the pursued cries on the race;
    And the hounds in leash are the hounds that run.
Hidden stars by the shown stars’ sheen;
    (And a million suns are but as one);
Colours unseen by the colours seen,
And sounds unheard heard sounds between,
    And a night is in the light of the sun.
An ambuscade of lights in night,
    (And a million secrets are but as one),
And a night is dark in the sun’s light,
    And a world in the world man looks upon.
Hidden stars by the shown stars’ wings,
    (And a million cycles are but as one),
And a world with unapparent strings
Knits the stimulant world of things;
    Behold, and vision thereof is none.
The world above in the world below,
    (And a million worlds are but as one),
And the One in all; as the sun’s strength so
Strives in all strength, glows in all glow
    Of the earth that wits not, and man thereon.
Braced in its own fourfold embrace
    (And a million strengths are as strength of one),
And round it all God’s arms of grace,
The world, so as the Vision says,
    Doth with great lightning-tramples run.
And thunder bruiteth into thunder,
    (And a million sounds are as sound of one),
From stellate peak to peak is tossed a voice of wonder,
And the height stoops down to the depths thereunder,
    And sun leans forth to his brother sun.
And the more ample years unfold
    (With a million songs as song of one),
A little new of the ever old,
A little told of the never told,
    Added act of the never done.
Loud the descant, and low the theme,
    (A million songs are as song of one)
And the dream of the world is dream in dream,
But the one Is is, or nought could seem;
    And the song runs round to the song begun.
This is the song the stars sing,
    (Tonèd all in time);
Tintinnabulous, tuned to ring
A multitudinous-single thing,
    (Rung all in rhyme)."
Chorus,"My grandfather went on his moped to the factory, two hours travel each way.
The rest of the days he fished in the woods.
The fishing rods and the nets he tied to the moped.
When I was old enough, he took me.
We rode with our legs out in the air on the bags.
We fished for eel.
Boiled water out of the creek for coffee, tea, and soup.
If we didn’t catch anything, we had nothing.
At night, when we lay to sleep, the world changed.
It talks to you.
You hear. You smell.
When the water goes down, the ground has a scent.
Small bodies walking through the open tent,
over the sleeping bag,
then, at a certain hour, it’s quiet.
In the morning, but some time before the sun, a bird would sing,
then another. They all move to the highest branch.
They make a chorus. Locating one another.
A leaf sways in the first light.
Many leaves, suspended, without contracting a single muscle.
They are like birds.
I was happy. I had survived. I was young."
Cows in the Evening,"She’s unsatisfied
the wild night shift
brings out coyotes
I know a blue song
when I recognize it
prize of conviction
a bovine torment
I hear heartbreak
a history of family
social bonds tied
up by the farmers
there’s lots to eat
that’s not enough
in an open valley
of slippery woods
no words just tone
easy to distinguish
she’s been places
in her small world
big butter for their
american dreams
the herd is silent
they feel troubles
don’t know what to
do about theirs
or her own"
XIII. Return to Suzhou: Master of the Nets,"It was meant to conjure the life of a fisherman—
solitude simplicity and peace—
hence the name—Master of the Nets Garden.
Not the real life, of course, but what a nobleman
(who else would bankroll such quiet grace?)
imagines when he thinks life of a fisherman:  
the sea in miniature, harnessed, halcyon 
abundant fish (giant koi, not bass). 
It’s a stand-in wilderness, a Chinese garden—
each tree a forest, each rock a mountain—
for those obliged to keep close to the house.
There are even breaking waves: our would-be fisherman 
could watch, from covered walkways, a procession
of ripples launched across his fishpond’s surface
by pelting raindrops; his master gardener
dispensed perfection even in the rain. 
I visit in a downpour—paradise—
while, out on open sea, a master fisherman,
expanse itself his garden, plies his nets."

Nets of roots,       fate-kept not-death fungal sheets,

Crawling              now     whirred opened cells,

from “Phantasus”,"translated by Babette Deutsch and Avrahm Yarmolinsky
On a mountain of sugar-candy,
under a blossoming almond-tree,
twinkles my gingerbread house.
Its little windows are of gold-foil, out of its chimney steams wadding.
In the green heaven, above me, beams the Christmas tree.

In my round sea of tinfoil
are mirrored all her angels, all her lights!

The little children stand about
and stare at me.

I am the dwarf Turlitipu.

My fat belly is made of gumdragon,
my thin pin-legs are matches,
my clever little eyes

  Auf einem Berg aus Zuckerkant,
unter einem blühenden Machandelbaum,
blinkt mein Pfefferkuchenhäuschen.
Seine Fensterchen sind aus Goldpapier,

Im grünen Himmel, über mir, rauscht die Weihnachtstanne.
In meinem See aus Staniol

Snow in the Suburbs,"                    Every branch big with it,
                    Bent every twig with it;
            Every fork like a white web-foot;
            Every street and pavement mute:
Some flakes have lost their way, and grope back upward when
Meeting those meandering down they turn and descend again.
        The palings are glued together like a wall,
        And there is no waft of wind with the fleecy fall.
            A sparrow enters the tree,
            Whereon immediately
        A snow-lump thrice his own slight size
        Descends on him and showers his head and eye
                    And overturns him,
                    And near inurns him,
        And lights on a nether twig, when its brush
Starts off a volley of other lodging lumps with a rush.
            The steps are a blanched slope,
            Up which, with feeble hope,
        A black cat comes, wide-eyed and thin;
                    And we take him in."

Retirement,"When he becomes a monk, he says I will no longer be his daughter.
To one another, we would be people. Strangers.

He pauses, considering, then grips the wheel and keeps driving.
I don’t visit him enough and when I do, I never cook for him.
Imagine his monkhood. I would have to give him more respect

Owl,"In winter, we find her invisible
against the furrows
of cottonwood bark. Her swivel
and lean follow us until
we sit on the old polished log
we call creature. She blinks,
swells her feathers out, shakes and settles.
It’s a good day when I see an owl.
We watch until she drops—a fall
opening to swoop and glide. What is it
with lesbians and owls? Someone
asked. I’ll leave the question
there. There’s a world
the old trees make of water
and air. I like to feel the day
undress its cool oblivion, currents
moving the one mind of leaves,
shadows deeper with the breath
of owls. Just the chance she might
be there watching makes me
love—no—makes me loved."
Origin of Planets,"In this version, the valley
lime green after rain
rolls its tides before us.
A coyote bush shivers with seed.
We hold out our palms as if catching snow—
our villages of circular tracts
overcast with stars.
We have been moving together in sequence
for thousands of years, paralyzed
only by the question of time.
But now it is autumn under bishop pines—
the young blown down by wind feed
their lichens to the understory.
We follow the deer-path
past the ferns, to the flooded
upper reaches of the estuary.
The channel snakes through horsetails
and hemlock as the forest deepens, rises
behind us and the blue heron,
frozen in the shallows.
The shadow of her long neck ripples.
Somewhere in the rustling tulle reeds
spider is casting her threads to the light
and we spot a crimson-hooded fly agaric,
her toadstool’s gills white
as teeth as the sun
                bleeds into the Pacific.
We will walk the trail
until it turns to sand
and wait at the spit’s edge, listening
to the breakers, the seagulls
as they chatter their twilight preparations.
What we won’t understand
about the sound of the sea is no different
than the origin of planets
or the wind’s crystalline structures
irreversibly changing.
The albatross drags her parachute
over the earth’s gaping mouth.
We turn back only for the instant
the four dimensions fold
into a sandcastle—before its towers
are collapsed by waves.
The face that turns
toward the end of its world
dissolves into space—
despite us, the continuum
remains."

Winter: A Dirge,"The wintry west extends his blast,
   And hail and rain does blaw;
Or, the stormy north sends driving forth
   The blinding sleet and snaw:
While, tumbling brown, the burn comes down,
   And roars frae bank to brae;
And bird and beast in covert rest,
   And pass the heartless day.
“The sweeping blast, the sky o’ercast,”
   The joyless winter-day
Let others fear, to me more dear
   Than all the pride of May:
The tempest’s howl, it soothes my soul,
   My griefs it seems to join;
The leafless trees my fancy please,
   Their fate resembles mine!
Thou Power Supreme whose mighty scheme
   These woes of mine fulfil,
Here, firm, I rest; they must be best,
   Because they are Thy will!
Then all I want—O do Thou grant
   This one request of mine.—
Since to enjoy Thou dost deny,
   Assist me to resign."
Mazel Tov,"Circular breather, our dog can whine
without ceasing, his tail thumping the wall
beside the bed to call me up and out to the yard
instead. In moonlight, the hydrangeas’
white blossoms are a zodiac of branch-bound
constellations. Once, God called Abraham
out from his tent to the open field to count
the uncountable lights in the sky, promising
offspring bountiful as dust, numerous
as the stars. Like Abraham, I too left
my land, my birthplace, my father’s house.
But the closest I have to offspring
is lifting his leg at the azalea, nose busy
with the news the night air brings.
Mazel tov! we say at births and other
joyous occasions, the Jewish go-to
for Congratulations! Yet טוֹב tov means “good”
and מַזָּל mazel, “constellation” or “destiny,”
and sometimes, like Abraham, you must
leave the place that grew you to grow
toward better stars. In the house, my wife
is sleeping. Along the fence-top, a procession
of possums reminds that even in darkness
there are those who can see. Above,
trees, thick with summer, frame a porthole
of sky. Maybe, though, it’s not always the stars
that matter but the space between them,
the lines we draw to shape the absence,
the lives we forge around what goes missing.
From the deck, the cool breeze makes a festival
of the silver-lit leaves. Under my palm,
there’s the warmth of his fur, the rise
of his ribs. He doesn’t suspect his kidneys
are failing, that his muzzle is white
as the winter our vet has said he will
not live to see. Like all of us, he is
dying; like most of us, he doesn’t
know it. His chin on my leg, he trusts me
with the weight of his head. So, if I wish
you, mazel tov, know what I mean is,
May you find a reason to open
your door to the dark. I’ll mean,
May you live beneath good stars,
and take the time to notice."
Midnight Mass for the Dying Year,"Yes, the Year is growing old,
  And his eye is pale and bleared!
Death, with frosty hand and cold,
  Plucks the old man by the beard,
       Sorely,—sorely! 

The leaves are falling, falling,
  Solemnly and slow;
Caw! caw! the rooks are calling,
  It is a sound of woe,
       A sound of woe! 

Through woods and mountain-passes
  The winds, like anthems, roll;
They are chanting solemn masses,
  Singing; Pray for this poor soul,
       Pray,—pray!

And the hooded clouds, like friars,
  Tell their beads in drops of rain,
And patter their doleful prayers;—
  But their prayers are all in vain,
       All in vain! 

There he stands in the foul weather,
  The foolish, fond Old Year,
Crowned with wild flowers and with heather,
    Like weak, despised Lear,
       A king,—a king! 

Then comes the summer-like day,
  Bids the old man rejoice!
His joy! his last! O, the old man gray
  Loveth that ever-soft voice,
       Gentle and low. 

To the crimson woods he saith,
  And the voice gentle and low
Of the soft air, like a daughter's breath,
  Pray do not mock me so!
       Do not laugh at me!

And now the sweet day is dead;
  Cold in his arms it lies;
No stain from its breath is spread
  Over the glassy skies,
       No mist or stain! 

Then, too, the Old Year dieth,
  And the forests utter a moan,
Like the voice of one who crieth
  In the wilderness alone,
       Vex not his ghost!

Then comes, with an awful roar,
  Gathering and sounding on,
The storm-wind from Labrador,
  The wind Euroclydon,
        The storm-wind! 

Howl! howl! and from the forest
  Sweep the red leaves away!
Would, the sins that thou abhorrest,
  O Soul! could thus decay,
       And be swept away!

For there shall come a mightier blast,
  There shall be a darker day; 
And the stars, from heaven down-cast
  Like red leaves be swept away!
       Kyrie, Eleyson!
       Christe, Eleyson! "
"The Ark: Self-Portrait as Aphrodite Using Her Dress for a Sail, xxx.","Or perhaps—perhaps—I am just an upturned tree, all my roots earth
laden and bare. Perhaps I fell over so I could worship at the altars of birds.
Or I am a harlequin waterfowl, speckled—black-white, black-white—

so dark they throw off an emerald sheen. And here I am—still—at home
bobbing on top of this endless white sea, batting my lashes

"The Ark: Self-Portrait as Aphrodite Using Her Dress for a Sail, ii.","Early morning. Still dark. I am in a taxi. The most elegant ‘ti Creole in the world is on the radio. I catch a sliver and think how one tiny word can be sacred—an artifact—the only green thing that returns inside the beak.

We stop at a toll. It is just a toll—a toll like any toll—but I am thinking, We are all the children of migrants, none of us come from here. And I wonder if the toll-taker ever imagined that one day it would be this black mask in the back seat, or that red mask on the driver.
The toll-taker smiles. I smile. We all smile. It is nine degrees outside. For a moment I am underwater and can’t remember which city I am in. Not Boston, but London, Dublin maybe. Or maybe cities no longer exist. Maybe they are all beginning to shrink away, plane by plane, brick by brick. A woman lying dead on her couch for three years watching television.
And then, perhaps because I am suddenly unsure of which town I am in, or which town I will be in by evening, the thought to pass through my mind next is, And just what is so wrong with being destroyed?"
Head-Turner,
sound and fury,"The gloom is
the off-white of white. Because white can’t know
what white knows. Where’s the life in that?
Where’s the right in that? Where’s the white in that?
At the bone of bone white breathes the fear of being,
the frustration of seeming unequal to white.
White portraits on white walls signal ownership of all,
even as white walls white in.
And this is understandable, yes,
understandable because the culture claims white
is owed everything—a wealth of inheritance
a system insures. In each generation
the equation holds—and better than
before and indifferent to now and enough
and always and inevitably white.
This is what it means to wear a color and believe
its touch an embrace. Even without luck
or chance of birth the scaffolding has rungs
and legacy and the myth of meritocracy fixed in white.
That’s how white holds itself together
as the days hold so many white would not—
White is living within brick-and-mortar, walling off
all others’ loss, exhaustion, aggrieved
exposure, dispossessed despair—
in daylight white hardens its features.
Eyes, which hold all light, harden.
Jaws, closing down on justice,
harden into a fury that will not call
white to account even as for some
its pledge is cut out from under.
If people could just come clean about their lives,
even as poverty exists inside white walls,
and just being white is what’s working.
Who implies white could disown its own
even as white won’t strike its own structure.
Even as white won’t oust its own system.
All redress fuels nothing the second another
can be thrown out.
In daylight white’s right to righteous rage
doubles down on the supremacy
of white in our way."
The Mansion,"It all changed
when the daughters of  men
began giving birth to us.
We had no hair.
Our mothers held us
against their thick hair.
It tickled our throats
as we suckled.
There were more and more and more
of us.
The hairy said,
“We want your smooth.”
We said,
“We want your hairy.”
We all wept
because no one
had what they wanted.
We escaped more and more
to the beach.
The hairy hated water
but it was different for us.
Our hips swiveled
as we climbed
deeper and deeper.
We held our breath.
We told our hairy families
that we belonged in the water.
They clutched at us.
One day
one of us
found it.
Our first pearl.
So smooth.
So strong.
So perfect.
We raked our fingers
through the sea bottom.
We stuffed coral with pearls
and molded it.
Among the seaweed and shells
our mansion rose.
One day
one of us
went back to the shore.
She showed
a pearl to them.
They said,
“We will give you
five bags of hair.”
Some of  us became traders
while the rest built.
The more magnificent our mansion became
the more pearls they wanted.
They said to our traders,
“We will give you
ten bags of hair for each pearl.”
Our traders brought back
bags and bags of hair.
We raced
through our winding passageways
to deposit the bags.
We loved rubbing along
our smooth bumpy walls.
Food grew on our walls
and we suckled the pearls.
We kissed.
Some of our bellies grew
into enormous pearls.
Some of  our babies
were hairy yet so slick!
Then we found
fewer and fewer pearls.
We raked the sea bottom
farther and farther away.
The traders pressed for more.
They pressed and pressed and pressed.
We convened
and said no.
Some of our traders said,
“But we have to have hair!”
We laughed and said,
“For what?”
Then we found
a hollowed-out wall.
Another wall swayed loose.
And in our storage cavern
hair began seeping
out of the bags.
Hair crawled
all over our walls.
Suckling the pearls,
hair got into our mouths.
Kissing,
hair got in between our lips.
We awoke
with strands around our necks.
We tore them off.
We gathered hair off
our precious walls.
We told the thieves,
“Stop bringing back hair!”
But they could not help it.
They stole more pearls
and returned with more bags.
They said,
“We must do it.”
They said,
“The world demands it.”
They said,
“Hair is the only way.”
We convened
and decided.
Thirty-two thousand years later
bubbles of our laughter
still rise.
A few
still sell pearls
and wonder where we are.
 "
Theft,"The moon
Was an old, old woman, tonight,
Hurrying home;
Calling pitifully to her children,
The stars,
Begging them to go home with her
For she was afraid,
But they would not.
They only laughed
While she crept along
Huddling against the dark blue wall of the Night
Stooping low,
Her old black hood wrapped close about her ears,
And only the pale curve of her yellow cheek
With a tear in the hollow of it
Showing through.
And the wind laughed too,
For he was teasing the old woman,
Pelting her with snowballs,
Filling her old eyes with the flakes of them,
Making her cold.
She stumbled along, shivering,
And once she fell,
And the snow buried her;
And all her jewels
Slid from the old bag
Under her arm
And fell to earth,
And the tall trees seized them,
And hung them about their necks,
And filled their bony arms with them.
All their nakedness was covered by her jewels,
And they would not give them back to her.
The old moon-woman moaned piteously,
Hurrying home;
And the wild wind laughed at her
And her children laughed too,
And the tall trees taunted her
With their glittering plunder."

My father Bacchus wanted a daughter instead of me.
He felt the threat a son implies, and took you, my infant
virility, scarf-skin like a halo, angel of my innocence
fore-fledged. Before the ritual, there was guilt. You were
vestigial as the divot where the angel pinched my lips
in binding silence. Would I see myself in style or fit
if I encountered you, my soul, draped like a lost mitten
on a fencepost? Tattered as a moth-eaten turtleneck.
            Hood like the hood of a headsman.
If you were re- appended, would you lisp like chiffon

Let me speak to you as the tree I climbed as a child,
the one in the far corner of my grandmother’s yard,
whose bark was a tapestry of rough diamonds.
Your first branch was low enough to leap to,
textured enough to hold me. And each branch after
placed as though to keep me climbing.
I paused only to press my ear to your trunk
and hear it: the heartbeat of water
moving toward the leaves, the conversation
between roots and sky. Climbing until my hair
twined your needles’ spines; until, anointed
by your green, you took root within me; so I speak
from the part of me who grows you, grows
with you, who will always live in your branches.
And in the boughs, so many there with me.
A vantage we could not have reached
on our own, a vision otherwise beyond us.
All of us, in that overstory, unalone."
"Sing, O Barren One, Who Did Not Bear a Child","—Isaiah, 54:1
Her hand sharp in the small of Hagar’s back, Sarai, that barren
punster, pimped her handmaid to her husband, saying, “As I am barren
please ‘consort’ (בנה bo-na, in Hebrew) with her” by literally saying,
“I shall be ‘built up’ (אִבָּנֶה ibaneh) through her.” A barren
women can still be clever, though rabbis tea-leaved this to imply
a childless woman is a ruined structure in need of rebuilding. Barren,
however, was not a ruin forced on us, but a path my wife and I have chosen. A choice
not so much against a child as for other things—our art, each other: a life barren
only of all we’ll never know. God said, “I’ll call you
by a different name and your destiny shall change.” Sarai, barren,
had no children but Sarah did. Mom is a name I’ve cried times beyond counting,
yet is a name I’ll never be called—less a name than a state of being; once borne,
innate as DNA. “Wife” or “writer,” though, are titles non-familial,
vocational, requiring daily upkeep, a renewal of Yes, I will still bear
this—and be stronger for it? Who can say. Perhaps we’ll end up
most defined by what we are not. Yet bared
by the roof of our ruined structure, we count the countless stars, grow
our shared life in place of bearing
a new one. Because before Sarah and even before Sarai
was the first of the three names she’d eventually bear:
Iscah, whose root might be סָּכְתָה sakhta (saw) which would make her sight a prophet’s,
divinely inspired, or סוֹכִין sokhin, a duller lot, meaning all “gazed upon” her beauty: barren
Iscah—precursor to the name Jessica—like all women, torn between being a seer
and being the one seen. So, prophet, tell me: Is the only happy ending really a baby?"
A Question to Ask Once the Honeymoon is Over,"Big around as my bike helmet and high as my ankle, the box turtle
was halfway from my side of the road
to the other. The warm sun felt delicious;
my legs, strong, and it was almost
to the center line. I hadn’t been passed by a car
for miles. Figuring if it was still there, I’d pick it up
on the way back, I cycled past.
                                                                Years before,
the woman across the street was shaped like that turtle,
or more like a toadstool, really, squat bell
of a body atop the thin stalks of her legs, milky and bare
beneath her frayed black housedress. It hurt her to move—clear
even from my second-story window—so she brought
her trash out in increments, in small, bursting
grocery bags. She tossed each out the door onto the porch, then
nudged them, one step to the next, before easing—carefully,
painfully—herself down, a step at a time. Then she toed them,
finally, slowly, slowly into a crumpled heap at the curb. I left
my window to help; then took her trash out every week after.
                                                                That story—
                                                       I hadn’t yet
                                                                told it to my wife, had I?
                        But there was the turnaround
quicker than expected and I spun
to find a beat-down bus trailed by all the fuming cars
that hadn’t passed me.
                               Steadying my handlebars against the wind,
I rode back hard, dodging around crushed
squirrels and tire-splayed birds.
                                                 The turtle
was just where I’d left it, but with the top of its shell
torn away. The dead turtle,
a raw red bowl, its blood slashing the twinned yellow lines
into an unequal sign,
                    as in a ≠ b, as in thinking about doing the right thing
is not the same as doing it. As in, how many times
did I watch that old woman shuffle bags down the stairs
(really, how many?) before I went from watching
to helping? As in, with my wife beside me
I am the woman who does not hesitate
to lay down her bike and give a small life
safe passage. As in, I biked slowly
home, told no one. As in:
                 Will she love me
                      less when she learns
                I am not equal
                                      to the person I am when she is watching?"

I love the squeaky door handles swinging open at the twin liquor store on the old
side of congress. By “old” I mean it hasn’t been gentrified yet. I want every grandpa
truck to stay owned by a grandpa & my grandpa to always have gap-toothed yellow

                         Speak, sing to me, caw and fuss
                         among what brittle branches
                         left, I have opened my windows;
                         I am listening.
                         Speak,
            you hellbender—giant salamander you are—a rarity
            now put on educational display, you eel-looking
            haint once pulled up by fisherman in these mountains.
                         Speak, because no one knows who you are
            anymore; you must make us remember. Turn your
            slack maw to my tapping on the bent plexiglass
                         and speak.
                         Say what it is you need to say.
            Oh, and you. You with your thick skull blown apart
            with a high-caliber swagger, your memory long
            and your once trumpeting
                         gone, speak to me
                         from beyond.
                         Tell me
            what it was to have those ears of yours in fury,
            raised like giant gray flags, how hard you fought,
            and even once shot how you just stood there
            confused, already dead but refusing to fall
            until your knees buckled, the rest of you slumped,
            and the great pillars of your tusks were
            chain-sawed from your face.
                                                I need to hear especially
            from you: I have a photo here of a man
            grinning with your lopped-off tail in his fist.
            I need you
                         to speak, dammit,
                         speak.
                         Say what it is you need to say.
            Or how about you: kin but safe
            in a cage, I’ve heard your placid
            chewing at the zoo—you took a sweet potato
            from my hand with the wet, breathing end
            of your trunk, slid it into the deep
            socket of your mouth.
                         I know that sound—
            I smiled at your keeper, fed you another treat, but now,
                         now, I need to you to speak.
                         Try it—swallow down
                         that food and flex
                         your tongue, push out the
                         grassy air from those
                         miraculous lungs.
                         I am waiting;
                         we are all waiting.                          
                         I am begging. Please, beast.
                         Speak.
                         We are running out of
                         time; there are so many us, and what’s left
of you are
swaying in pens, rocking from side to side, sleeping and aching
and craving and thinking—I know you are thinking—
but not saying a damn word.
            No, not one, not one,
            which I all we need,
            I swear—all of you,
you birds and cicadas, all you flying, leaping, vine-grabbing
canopy beings, all you furred and quilled things too,
or you chittering in your burrows and hiding the dark—
step from the mouth of your dens and speak.
            Listen to me,
            you belong here,
you with a mouth full of milk, with dirt under your claws, all of you
rooting and panting and hibernating and ruminating and standing
by the fence, watching us speed past in our cars.
            Listen to me.
            I need you to try,
            try to say
            just one word.
We can start slow with the low pleasure
sound, the delicious mmmm that closes the door to home,
then growl out that middle vowel and what comes after,
let the back of your throat issue forth a warning
and mean it, get angry with me,
because you’ve had enough, because if you don’t find these sounds
there will be nothing left.
Now, you’re almost there—
pull back your lips if you have them, show your teeth
if you have them, hiss, let out all the air, whatever air is left
and in doing so take us back to all our beginnings
with the sound of waves, with that final syllable—sea.
            Now try again.
            Try again.
            Try, please try.
            All at once.
            It’s such a small
            word on which
            your lives depend.
            I’ll do anything.
            Please, beast. Speak.
            Say it, with me, now:
            MERcy, merCY, mERcy, meeercy, merrrrcy, mercy, mercy, mercy.
            Now, please. Try. Try again.
            Repeat after me"
Against Despair: The Kid Goat,"—For Trina and Barb of Animal Haven Farm Sanctuary, Asheville, North Carolina
1.
Reader, meet the two women who sunk
everything they had into taking in broken
animals—the gimpy and oozing
critters, the ugly, lopsided, tail-less

pets, urine-soaked and drooling, zested
with fleas, the matted and discarded
scrapheaps left growling and bucking, pissing
on everything, the good-riddance left roped
to a chain-link fence.
No, I take that back.
Instead I want you to be
those two: I want you crazy
enough to try to fix those beasts—
to feed and brush and bathe and dip and
sweetmilk them whole; I want you to try,
to always try, despite the odds,
just as you coaxed the docile
fat-blind pig up on legs that eventually
broke from his own inbred
weight, just as you spritzed the mites
off a mangy hen that would be limp
in the claws of a hawk
later that same day. On the hill, a stubborn
but sometimes gentle sheep grows
cold under a blue tarp,
and in your truck is a towel across
the backseat for your favorite
but neurotic-as-hell dog, how you rushed her
to the vet only to see her
put down.
2.
No, let me make this real—
Reader, I want you tired, every joint
in your body stiff and worn.
I want you to finally strip off
your filthy clothes. Then, I want you jolted
from sleep by a cry that in your dreams
sounds like an infant wailing
and, now awake,
sounds just the damn same.
3.
Go. Find that kid goat
bleating in the grainy dark.
He’s no bigger than a lap dog,
and on his fist-sized head are the buds
of his horns—tiny, like
two popcorn pieces of warm bone—
two bright spots, the only thing
you can see.
Flip on the switch.
Now, you know.
With bare hands I want you to
clear the froth from his lolling
tongue. I want you to grab a rag,
a sponge, the corner of your shirt—
anything you can find—to sop
up the liquid—so much of it
you can’t tell what’s what—be it
mucus or bile or vomit or blood—
as if every water has been brought up
for this giving-in, as if his body
is already a river and rushing
away. Now, use your arms:
it takes strength to steady the
convulsing of a thing even this young,
and then, once his gaze rolls back to
white, you know what to do, you know
your job: push together the furred slits
of his lids, close the extinguished
horizons of his eyes.
4.
Don’t play stupid. You knew
this was coming. You’ve seen it
enough times. You’re not dumb,
just desperate to try
to save this little meat
goat the farmer dumped
at your door,
too septic and riddled
with worms
to even be killed
to eat.
5.
Now, get on your knees.
Mop it up. As you wring
out the rags don’t push away
what you know of the sun,
let yourself admit the light,
how it made his ears pink and transparent

revealed the secret veins of leaves,
how you adored it when they periscoped
to your voice and he looked up to
give you the small meditations
of fresh milk and hay in his mouth.
Go on. Get sentimental
if you have to—have a good cry—
no one is here, and besides,
who would care? Because you try,
don’t you? You always try.
But always, that impossible
riddle, always the word
riddled with the word
worms, as if each whip-like body was curled
into a question, a wriggling puzzle, a mob
infestation of questions—parasites that love
a home so hard they turned that kid goat
anemic, fevering, stuttering with a murmuring
heart, shitting out a writhing
pile of larvae and eggs. Little sips—
little hooks—little burrows—this was how,
little by little, that little goat finally
collapsed, arched his throat back
as if to be slit, jerked his legs up into the
nothing like the fetus he was
just two months before.
6.
But here is the point: Do not ever
let yourself think it didn’t matter.
It mattered then
as it matters now, because until
this morning rose dull on the horizon
with this useless, good-for-nothing
goat now dead on your floor,
regardless, in spite of, no matter,
you fed a beast worthless, a real
lost cause not unlike
this whole stubborn,
beautiful, fucked-up planet
about to seize and drown
in its own melt.
7.
There really wasn’t a thing you could
do, but admit it: if you knew,
if you really could say he would not have died
last night but would certainly die
tomorrow, you’d force yourself
out of bed and do what it is you do:
you’d count his pills, warm his formula
over the stove, rake out his soiled pen,
and with arms wide, you’d bring him
a fresh bale of hay. Yes, that’s right: now say
his silly goat name—because, yes, every living
thing deserves a name—and you called him
Peanut, a playful way to say
he was a flake of the size he should have been,
so sick he did not jump or play as
he should but leaned his tiny face
exhausted into your leg. Now, bend
to stroke his scrawny
goat neck. Say, Good boy, Peanut.
We’ve got you. Now, now
there. Everything’s gonna be just fine.
You know it’s
a lie, but no matter.
Hope, you know by now,
is not a thing you feel
but something you do,
and this is your job. It’s what
you do; it’s what needs to be
done."
Self-Portrait as Land Snail,"Don’t get me wrong.
I’m a modest girl, couldn’t even strip off
at one of those nudie hot springs out west,
the whole place a flotsam
of much-nursed areolas and buoyant
scrotums while I sat prim
as Gidget, legs crossed and awkwardly
smiling on the shore. It’s just that the snail
is on to something—neither boy nor girl
but both, the critter is nearly mythic—a true
hermaphrodite that all alone
will go to its own kind of cyrobank and baste
itself, make a new batch of not-so-bouncies
in thin, flea-sized shells. But no, that’s not
me. That seems lonely. Better, with another
intersex other it will take
aim, flex back its bow, shoot a dart,
then wait to be impaled
in return. I couldn’t make this shit up
if I tried—this is no metaphor
but scientific fact—a telum amoris—literally,
a weapon of love—a James-Bond-worthy arrow
equipped with four blades spiked
with all the dirty talk a snail could want.
Cupid’s got nothing on this
mollusk congress, and because you know
how snails go, the foreplay is slow—
slow, slow, slow—my kind of sex—
going on and on until the hussy
who first received that dart has enough
then rises to fire back. Now, knowing this,
I can say I didn’t come out
all those years ago, whatever that means. No,
when I finally made a home
for my body in the bed of another
woman, I simply became
a land snail. Tired of being
a leaking receptacle for a man’s desire,
I needed to feel
an equal’s push against my own,
a willingness to be wounded and to
wound, receiving and giving at the same
time. Plainly said, I needed the kind of love
that finally let me take
my time; I needed to fire
an arrow of my damn own."
Wild Thing,"What I knew then was plastic packages
of ramen—instant, four for a dollar,
because with four eggs to match, I’d have myself
four dinners, provided I could keep the gas on
for the month and get that old stove lit.
with a match. I also knew what went
at the store for a buck: pinto beans and sliced white,
popcorn, carrots, peas . . . even juice, long as it was
orange, concentrated and frozen in a can.
But what I didn’t yet know was how
that word—buck—got started, back with
my daddy’s daddy’s daddy and on back
down the line, back when for their rheumy knees
men used panther oil brought all the way
up from Florida when panthers still lived
down there, back when men without a dime
to their name could pay land taxes in
skins and piled as many kills they could
on a wagon headed downtown
to sell deer for just that—for one dollar, one
buck, a pop. No, what I knew then were bucks
in my tip jar, how never to start the night empty
but to always put in a few of my own, otherwise
not a soul would think me worth a dollar
and would trash the whole shift
with the rattle of pocket change.
And though I couldn’t have said when deer season
hit, no one had to tell me
about the weather it brought, how cardboard
crammed between wind-rattled panes helped
but barely enough, how under every cover I owned
I’d sleep until the floor stung my feet
awake with cold. Once I got up and turned over
my car, I just might make it to work
on time, but not until I got stuck at a red light
with a man who split his two fingers apart
to make a V for the snake-flick of his fat
tongue, which meant something
about “a good time” before he gunned
his truck and gave me the full view
of what his flatbed towed—a whitetail
doe, one eye open but somehow more
milk or smoke or dirty dishwater than
eye, her tongue off its hinge, flopping
obscene with every bump down
that road. On my popping speakers, a new
version of that same old song—now you don’t need that
money when you look like that, do ya honey—
and it was then I knew the bullshit
made up for the endless litany to hit
these woods—all those floods that scrubbed
the babes from their burrows, lifting
their pink writing to a flotsam of rot, or else
a rage of flames to crowd those same holes
with natural-born enemies, snakes
huddled alongside a scorched blister
of mice and turtles nearly cooked
in their own shells—and everybody saying
wild things could care for themselves and always knew
what to do: how to seek higher
ground and survive. But really, believing that made me
just another fool in this world mistaking
the happiness of looking at a pretty, wild thing
with the happiness that thing feels.
Put another way, I was once young and terribly
pretty and gripped the wheel white, felt the rip
in the vinyl seat rub the part of my leg
raw where my skirt didn’t
cover. I shut off
my radio. In the silence was the talk of men I’d heard
all my life—the bumper stickers that read
show me your rack or chasing white
tail—all the old jokes—that buck not dead
but put down for his dirt nap and itching for a mount,
that doe not female but a slickhead, hot and ready
for the rut, all those not shot but taken in peak season,
in sweet, sweet November. Put another way, I was almost
on empty, and though no one
believed it or cared to see, I was just another
animal, and like all animals
desired, we would suffer."
black hair,"burgeons through my pores
bringing its small, itchy sores. Cuts
through my hands and stubbles up
enough to be visible when fitted
skin-tight to a mirror. One day,
I was standing so close you could
see each pore and I’d pluck until
every red-and-Black follicle knew
no hair was welcomed here.
Now they sprout and I’m foolish
with joy at every conjuring of
a bush. Every prick rubbing
their way through my patchy
happy face. Who will teach me
how to shave? YouTube, I guess
til my bois get this far. I wonder
if every beard grows like this: into
a nest made with oil and hope. Into
a boi made with oil after they threw
away the rope. I guess I’ll put
that in the search bar too: did it feel
good? To stop running from yourself?"
Rendering from “Historia Verdadera: Capítulo CLII”,"And he [Cuauhtémoc] ordered a horn to be sounded
that when heard by his captains and his warriors
was a signal
that they must fight in a new way,
that they must fall upon us,
that they must overcome us
or die trying
the sound
echoed deep within our ears, the sound
resounded deep in our heads,
and when they heard it,
his squadrons and his companies knew,
then or never
the fury and the force they gathered
in order to defeat us, I tell you, it’s as if
as soon as they heard it, his troops and his companies became aware
the moment was now
such rage and such power they summoned against us
I’m telling you, even now
I am seeing it and am there in that trance,
it’s like right now I see it and am there, in that
now, I see it, and am again there
in that daze,
that war."
from “Parallax”,"This thin edge of December
Wears out meagrely in the
Cold muds, rains, intolerable nauseas of the street.
Closed doors, where are your keys?
Closed hearts, does your embitteredness endure forever?
Torpidly
Afternoon settles on the town,
                       each hour long as a street—
In the rooms
A sombre carpet broods, stagnates beneath deliberate steps:
Here drag a foot, there a foot, drop sighs, look round for nothing, shiver.
Sunday creeps in silence
Under suspended smoke,
And curdles defiant in unreal sleep.
The gas-fire puffs, consumes, ticks out its minor chords—
And at the door
I guess the arrested knuckles of the one-time friend,
One foot on the stair delaying, that turns again."
On a Soldier Fallen in the Philippines,"     Streets of the roaring town,
     Hush for him, hush be still !
     He comes, who was stricken down
     Doing the word of our will.
     Hush !   Let him have his state,
     Give him his soldier’s crown.
     The grists of trade can wait
     Their grinding at the mill,
But he cannot wait for his honor, now the trumpet has been blown.
Wreathe pride now for his granite brow, lay love on his breast of stone.
     Toll !   Let the great bells toll 
     Till the clashing air is dim.
     Did we wrong this parted soul ?
     We will make it up to him.
     Toll !   Let him never guess
     What work we set him to.
     Laurel, laurel, yes ;
     He did what we bade him do.
Praise, and never a whispered hint but the fight he fought was good;
Never a word that the blood on his sword was his country’s own heart’s-blood.
     A flag for the soldier’s bier
     Who dies that his land may live ;
     O, banners, banners here,
     That he doubt not nor misgive !
     That he heed not from the tomb
     The evil days draw near
     When the nation, robed in gloom,
     With its faithless past shall strive.
Let him never dream that his bullet’s scream went wide of its island mark,
Home to the heart of his darling land where she stumbled and sinned in the dark.        "
A Grey Day,"Grey drizzling mists the moorlands drape,
Rain whitens the dead sea,
From headland dim to sullen cape
Gray sails creep wearily.
I know not how that merchantman
Has found the heart ; but ’t is her plan
Seaward her endless course to shape.
Unreal as insects that appall
A drunkard’s peevish brain,
O’er the gray deep the dories crawl,
Four-legged, with rowers twain :
Midgets and minims of the earth,
Across old ocean’s vasty girth
Toiling — heroic, comical !
I wonder how that merchant’s crew
Have ever found the will !
I wonder what the fishes do
To keep them toiling still !
I wonder how the heart of man
Has patience to live out its span,
Or wait until its dreams come true. "
Idyllic,"To lie beneath a cloudless sky
     On moss beneath a shallow brook
Where smells of wild-flowers in the dells
     Make me forgetful of my book,—
To dream of shepherd with his crook,
     Of sheep on grassy slopes asleep,—
To catch a visionary look
     Of shepherdess, and hear her step
Fall like a whisper on the ground,—
     To watch her sunny smiles, and see
Her dainty garments, soft and snowy,
     Fold gracefully her form around,—
’Tis like a day in Sicily
     With Daphnis and his sweetheart Chloë."
A Prayer,"It is my joy in life to find
   At every turning of the road,
The strong arm of a comrade kind
   To help me onward with my load.
And since I have no gold to give,
   And love alone must make amends,
My only prayer is, while I live, —
   God make me worthy of my friends!"
Pebbles,"Out of a pellucid brook
Pebbles round and smooth I took :
Like a jewel, every one
Caught a color from the sun, —
Ruby red and sapphire blue,
Emerald and onyx too,
Diamond and amethyst, —
Not a precious stone I missed :
Gems I held from every land
In the hollow of my hand.
Workman Water these had made ;
Patiently through sun and shade,
With the ripples of the rill
He had polished them until,
Smooth, symmetrical and bright,
Each one sparkling in the light
Showed within its burning heart
All the lapidary’s art ;
And the brook seemed thus to sing :
Patience conquers everything !
 "
Song at Daybreak,"Unto the portal of the Day there came
A shining presence fashioned out of flame,
And from that purple threshold of the world
Arrows of fire across the shadows hurled.
Into the forest, over plain and sea
The darts in silence sped unerringly,—
Lances of sunlight from the Morning’s bow,—
Until the firmament was all aglow.
Then from the zenith suddenly I heard
The dew-fresh notes of some enraptured bird,
Lost in the golden labyrinth of light,
Singing the dreams of a departed Night."
A Tale,"This youth too long has heard the break
Of waters in a land of change.
He goes to see what suns can make
From soil more indurate and strange.
He cuts what holds his days together
And shuts him in, as lock on lock:
The arrowed vane announcing weather,
The tripping racket of a clock;
Seeking, I think, a light that waits
Still as a lamp upon a shelf,—
A land with hills like rocky gates
Where no sea leaps upon itself.
But he will find that nothing dares
To be enduring, save where, south
Of hidden deserts, torn fire glares
On beauty with a rusted mouth,—
Where something dreadful and another
Look quietly upon each other."
Deathscape Lullaby,"Broken crimson
Mercedes sedan.
Cotton-wood, milk-weed.
The taste of cold metal
and the repetition of three AM
sirening ambulance rides.
Yellow cream, three-tiered
birthday cake.
Cherry lip balm.
Pale blue satin shorts
and matching jacket
with my name embroidered
in hot pink, Cindy.
Poochie, my childhood
beagle, whimpering inside
the locked rooms
of night. A field of black and white
dappled ponies. Blinding,
the silence.
An orange plastic
lighter, and red
gas station
canister
of kerosene."
Nike of Samothrace,"—Her fish scales, her chains, the woman’s headless                                  
wings and blown
tunic of Parian marble. —The wet-see-thru
camisole. By sea she’s
arrived, lighting on the ship’s prow. One leg
thrust forward, the draped sails
of robes. (Somewhere near, between defeat and prayer, a drive-by
shooting. —The candy thrown around the body, the ambulance. They stole
the dead girl’s dog, while far away outside Jakarta
in sweatshops some work for 20 cents an hour, and there’s
one with his mouth taped shut in sunlight.) From a sanctuary
she was unearthed and taken to the Louvre
where on the grand Daru staircase she stands, stolen, moving           
in several directions at once."
Grandfather,"grand·fa·ther.  (noun) 1. the father of one’s father or mother: As in, my father’s father, my grandfather, sharecropped on a farm in Midway, AL. Angry all the time, he fled to Ohio for cleaner work, but the same dirt beat him down through his day. 2. the person who founded or originated something: In 1832, Thomas D. Rice, grandfather of Jim Crow, popularizes the phrase with a song of same name, dancing and singing in blackface, to play a trickster figure, without the wisdom of Anansi, but “nah, uh-uh, nah nah nah nah nah nah nah nah nah,” was all black people heard when he sang his song.
~
grand·fa·ther.  (verb) [with object] 1. North American informal exempt (someone or something) from a new law or regulation: Landowners, who stole land from indigenous people before the Federal Land Policy and Management Act struck this behavior down in 1976, have been grandfathered in to keep these hallowed grounds.

Triptych,"His wind-swirled fingertips
untangle the roots of salt water,
thorned with wrens
pecking at roans
whipping their manes
toward some new sunlight,
some new charred horse bit’s history.
Cornered into being a son
he should have never
left a snow-tipped leaf’s edge
in the hillside
where a barren cloud’s porous skull
keeps a winter house.
—
Coyote, open-jawed,
limp shoulder against his ear,
its silhouette: midnight blue—
            a satchel of stars
                        where its tail snaps     awake.
—
A knot of lung steam
behind his ribs;
a meteor charring white
over yellowing aspen;
he reaches down,
loosens shoelaces—
wind-dried roots unfurl,
his new name: seven times his height.
His knees press light to dark,
creasing them over and over
until his face smears and        fades."
At Sixty-Five,"It was all so different than he expected.
For years he’d been agnostic; now he meditated.
For years he’d dreamed of being an artist living abroad;
now he reread Baudelaire, Emerson, Bishop.
He’d never considered marriage . . .
Still, a force through green did fuse.
Yes, he wore his pants looser.
No, he didn’t do crosswords in bed.
No, he didn’t file for Social Security.
Yes, he danced alone in the bathroom mirror,
since younger men expected generosity.
Long ago, his thesis had been described as promising,
“with psychological heat and the consuming
will of nature.” Now he thought, “This then is all.”
On the rooftop, in pale flickering moonlight,
he pondered the annihilated earth.
At the pond, half-a-mile across was not
too far to swim because he seemed to be
going toward something. Yes, the love impulse
had frequently revealed itself in terms of conflict;
but this was an old sound, an austere element.
Yes, he’d been no angel and so what . . .
Yes, tiny moths emerged from the hall closet.
Yes, the odor of kombucha made him sick.
Yes, he lay for hours pondering the treetops,
the matriarchal clouds, the moon.
Though his spleen collected melancholy trophies,
his imagination was not impeded."
The Aim Was Song,"Before man came to blow it right
    The wind once blew itself untaught,
And did its loudest day and night
    In any rough place where it caught.
Man came to tell it what was wrong:
    It hadn’t found the place to blow;
It blew too hard—the aim was song.
    And listen—how it ought to go!
He took a little in his mouth,
    And held it long enough for north
To be converted into south,
    And then by measure blew it forth.
By measure. It was word and note,
    The wind the wind had meant to be—
A little through the lips and throat.
    The aim was song—the wind could see."
Country of Water,"I know who I am because I believe it
The breath in my chest
Insistent in its choice
The skin that I’m in
The bones and blood and veins
It carries like a promise
          Have you witnessed the ocean
Moving with so much gust and life
Have you witnessed the river
Still waters bubbling the rebirth of school
           Have you witnessed your body
Its own country of water
Moving against the tide of a world
So heartbreaking      it’s forgotten its own voice
Be still friend
Be still
Be kind to yourself in the gift of stillness
I know who I am because I believe it
I know
I know
Who I
Who I
Believe
Believe
Believe
In three’s we will come
A drip of water moving against a boulder
Water slow and steady can turn rock
Into a pebble
Like anxiety
Like self-doubt
Smaller
Smaller
Until gone
Let your love for yourself be the water
Be the rise
Be the mist
Let you be
I know who I am because I believe it
I believe I am my mother’s daughter
I believe I am my grandmother’s prayers
I believe I am my great-grandmother’s backbone revealed
I am I am because I believe so
I am because a woman believed in me
What a continent I became
What a country of water I be
I flow and fluid and rise and ebb and I believe in me
           I am not wrong
I am wronged
In this skin I’ve reclaimed
From this trap of this country’s tourniquet
Only to find the sweet solace is a river bed
Its mud beckons me closer to its silt
Small fish and forgotten glass unearth themselves
Like baby teeth
Only one can cut into flesh purposely
Only one does not know what it is capable of
I believe in the air as much as I believe in the fire
I believe in the fire as much as the water consumes
I believe in a higher source
Energetic and wise
I believe in my ability to thrive
This body
        This body is a good thing
Turning two miles walked over a bridge into a family’s meal
Creating poems that become cashier’s checks
Dentist bills and rent
I’ve three holes in my teeth
And a nation that pretends I didn’t almost die for it to survive
I am I am still here still here
I am still here and like the ocean, full of salt and shells
Full of ship remnants and noble ones
I bleed and the sand grieves
I be because someone survived for me to be here
Today
Breathing this almost air
Marching for cleaner belongings
My front seat beneath the deadening stars
Is still a seat
Is still a ground
Is still a home that I can pronounce my given name
To write amongst the forgotten names
The taken and the ignored
But today
            There are no tombstones
Today
There is no true death
Only life
Only life
Only a song of the living
Maybe even a belief system
With water as its minister
            I am water
I dive into my own currents
I dress my dreams in the satin breath
Of my ancestors
I know
I know
I know who I am
I know who I am because I believe it"
dream where every black person is standing by the ocean,"& we say to her
             what have you done with our kin you swallowed?
& she says
             that was ages ago, you’ve drunk them by now
& we don’t understand
& then one woman, skin dark as all of us
             walks to the water’s lip, shouts Emmett, spits
&, surely, a boy begins
              crawling his way to shore"
One Boy Told Me,"Music lives inside my legs.
It’s coming out when I talk.
I’m going to send my valentines
to people you don’t even know.
Oatmeal cookies make my throat gallop.
Grown-ups keep their feet on the ground
when they swing. I hate that.
Look at those 2 o’s with a smash in the middle––
that spells good-bye.
Don’t ever say “purpose” again,
let’s throw the word out.
Don’t talk big to me.
I’m carrying my box of faces.
If I want to change faces I will.
Yesterday faded
But tomorrow’s in BOLDFACE.
When I grow up my old names
will live in the house
where we live now.
I’ll come and visit them.
Only one of my eyes is tired.
The other eye and my body aren’t.
Is it true all metal was liquid first?
Does that mean if we bought our car earlier
they could have served it
in a cup?

There’s a stopper in my arm
that’s not going to let me grow any bigger.
I’ll be like this always, small.
And I will be deep water too.
Wait. Just wait. How deep is the river?
Would it cover the tallest man with his hands in the air?
Your head is a souvenir.
When you were in New York I could see you
in real life walking in my mind.
I’ll invite a bee to live in your shoe.
What if you found your shoe
full of honey?
What if the clock said 6:92
instead of 6:30? Would you be scared?
My tongue is the car wash
for the spoon.
Can noodles swim?
My toes are dictionaries.
Do you need any words?
From now on I’ll only drink white milk on January 26.
What does minus mean?
I never want to minus you.
Just think––no one has ever seen
inside this peanut before!
It is hard being a person.
I do and don’t love you––
isn’t that happiness?"
ADVICE (for E),"Be the stealth      between stones
       The abracadabra        amongst        clones
  Be the fighting fish with a fancy tail
       The wizard who        deifies        gnomes
  No worry        be happy        missiles flying
       While innocents        are dying
  You’re pretty nimble        for your age
      One day a wombat        next day        a sage
  On the way to feeding a despot
       You summoned        your rage
  Most virtuous mother        don’t be fooled
       They will bomb our shelter        scorch our earth
  Unwind        regroup        turn swine        into pearl

No more than most myself save nothing is

American Household,"Here I’m untethered, or else this American household is.
A shame for guest and resident alike, torn asunder,
Immovable, unmoving, horizon line before it closes
On the embankment, which is too a slowing thunder.
Whether cash & cake were meant for us the undeserving
Is a frenzy of thought, an amusement from the spoils
Of corporation able to outweigh the will unnerving
All restraint from the madness or immodesty that coils
Each milligram back into the sky blue oxy addiction

Assembly of the glad in ordinary deliverance from fear:
First fuel in the plot that turns us into tyrants unspeaking
Yet another dream to make them do what in wakeful hour
Is lawless for us depraved and still deprived of power"
Inupiaq Women,"She paddles and streams 
her kayak up Kobuck River.
At daybreak, 
she passes the salt flats into  
the glass water; she skims 
for cod and chum,          hand over oar,
            hand over oar, 
ripples tightening the drawstring
on her parka. A taffeta of cold air
hits her cheeks; they are sun-
wind chapped, a sign of Inupiaq women
subsisting for their young families.
In body, in Inuit, she thrives on the bleakest
ecstatic love. Here on her knees,
in her seal skin buoyant boat,
her duties of her village complete,
she knows her place among the caribou 
women. She knows her children 
with their earphones on, 
while playing video games, 
will not follow her in the knowledge of ice, 
dressing a caribou, preparing dry-fish, 
jarring jellies, dip netting hooligans, 
purse netting whitefish, tracking 
and setting traps for marmot, squirrels,
arctic fox and wolverines. She thinks 
of the children, hand over oar; 
they will stay at the village, carve 
for cleaving water with Inupiat hands."
To a Wreath of Snow,"O transient voyager of heaven!
   O silent sign of winter skies!
What adverse wind thy sail has driven
   To dungeons where a prisoner lies?
Methinks the hands that shut the sun
   So sternly from this morning’s brow
Might still their rebel task have done
   And checked a thing so frail as thou.
They would have done it had they known
   The talisman that dwelt in thee,
For all the suns that ever shone
   Have never been so kind to me!
For many a week, and many a day
   My heart was weighed with sinking gloom
When morning rose in mourning grey
   And faintly lit my prison room
But angel like, when I awoke,
   Thy silvery form so soft and fair
Shining through darkness, sweetly spoke
   Of cloudy skies and mountains bare;
The dearest to a mountaineer
   Who, all life long has loved the snow
That crowned her native summits drear,
   Better, than greenest plains below.
And voiceless, soulless, messenger
   Thy presence waked a thrilling tone
That comforts me while thou art here
   And will sustain when thou art gone"
Sunflowers,"I’m in the world but I still want the world.
I’m full of longing and can’t move,
enthralled in the garden. Having died 
all the way back to the root, I grow again 
into a version of the thing I love. I’m her 
and not her, hermaphrodite with a heart 
like a plateful of black flames.
The bees inspect me like doctors. 
All my hard little tears, future selves 
who haven’t grown. Bedclothes swell on the line
while around me giant sunflowers burn
through their masks of radiant desire."
Vestiges,"Not the riverbank. Not the sedges
                   or the black hum
of blow flies that feed off a corpse.
                    Not the river. Not
its indifferent current. Not the bridge
                   or how it bemoans 
the loss of someone who’s left town
                 —the year, the date, 
unimportant. Not the address scribbled 
                  onto scrap paper.
Not the hospital or the room at home,
                 pulsing and humid.
Not the midwife who prays between 
                parted legs. Not
the just born baby. Not his open mouth 
               forming its first 
word because the word is stillborn. Not
                the afterbirth,
its collapse, a memory of its last breath. 
                 No. None of this.
I pretend I’m well-mannered and polite.
                 Wet with my grief.
Barefoot. Burdened by footprints I follow,
                those I’ve trekked
in the mud. I’ve come with no good sense
               of discretion. I seek
sins and secrets, what remains I excavate
                 from the coffin
or confessional. My tongue is pickled 
                in a jar of ink. 
The months have fed from my body 
               by the handful. 
Even so, I foam at the mouth for what
              was never mine."
Still Life of Cárdenas Hacienda with Cats,"there was a house at the bottom of a mountain
                        sunbaked mud and straw and as tiny as a heart
with ¼ the rooms and in that cavity a woman gave birth
                        to blood and vomit every year
for thirteen years and sometimes her husband came home at night
                        but mostly he hunted gold buried along the road to Santa Fe
if he ever found it she would never know
                        he guzzled all gold and Taos Lightning
as the children went without some survived some didn’t
                        one boy drowned in the washtub and one twin died at birth
one son clutched a yowling cat to his chest
                        in a hammock on the ocean floor while torpedoes
pounded the sub like shots of mezcal on the guard rails in the canyon
                        where the world split open again at the hip
and another son drove her home and another turned her
                        on her side so she could breathe easier
the living twin closed her eyes and somewhere in Arizona,
                        another daughter fell to her knees and cried at the kitchen stove
a week later, another son bailed him out of jail
                        and thirty years later, a niece and a nephew visited him
at the house made of earth and his mother’s blood,
                        and stray cats played in the orchard."
Unarcheology of ‘Father’,"a Markov Sonnet, with thanks to Fargo Tbakhi
Baba, I held your hand as you were dying
Half-asleep, floating between Unknowing
And here: your gazed fixed into the greying wall.
                        *
Half-asleep, floating away from an unknowable
Here, your gaze was fixed past the wall greying
from hospital to hospice to bedroom to heaven.
                        *
Here, your gaze was fixed. Past the wall, greying
from hospital to hospice to bedroom, the heaven
of your unforgotten youth played out before us.
                        *
From hospital to hospice, from bedroom to heaven,
Your unforgettable youth played out before us: 1967,
Summer whispering in the ferns, gator dead on the mantle.
                        *
You un-forgot your youth and let it play out before
Summer whispered the ferns dead. A gator on the mantel
Meant hunting season was beginning, its heat coming still.
                        *
Summer was a whisper. Ferns, dead on the mantle. A gator
Meant hunting season was a heat you named beginning:
This is how you convinced yourself you were American. 
                        *
I wrote heat, and beginning, but meant hunting season.
This is how I know I am american: I can convince
Other men I am worthy of their roughest entries.
                        *
This is the shape of my knowing: I’m a convincing american
To other men who see, in me, a rough entry. A worthy
Hole would know when to submit, how to say daddy. 
                        *
To other men, I am a rough entry, a worthy
Hole. I know how to submit, call daddy
Undeserving men: all spittle, teeth, and thrashing.
                        *
Hole I once submitted to, Daddy where once
Was undeserving man: in all the spittle and thrashing,
He was my first love, my earliest childhood friend.
                        *
When I was spittle & thrash, I thought myself undeserving
Of him. Being in love with my earliest childhood friend
Was how my body first taught itself to swallow.
                        *
I once was in love with my earliest childhood friend.
This is how my body first learned to swallow
the impossible wound of itself: summer quieted to whisper.
                        *
I first taught my body to swallow itself
As a wound scraped quiet on an impossible summer.
Baba, it was you who held my hand as I was dying.
                        *
I quieted the impossible wound of my body,
Baba. I held your hand while you were dying,
Half-asleep. I let you float off, Unknowing."
The Harp of Broken Strings,"A stranger in a stranger land,
    Too calm to weep, too sad to smile,
I take my harp of broken strings,
    A weary moment to beguile;
And tho no hope its promise brings,
    And present joy is not for me,
Still o’er that harp I love to bend,
    And feel its broken melody
With all my shattered feelings blend.
I love to hear its funeral voice
    Proclaim how sad my lot, how lone;
And when, my spirit wilder grows,
    To list its deeper, darker tone.
And when my soul more madly glows
    Above the wrecks that round it lie,
It fills me with a strange delight,
    Past mortal bearing, proud and high,
To feel its music swell to might.
When beats my heart in doubt and awe,
    And Reason pales upon her throne,
Ah, then, when no kind voice can cheer
    The lot too desolate, too lone,
Its tones come sweet upon my ear,
    As twilight o’er some landscape fair:
As light upon the wings of night
    (The meteor flashes in the air,
The rising stars) its tones are bright.
And now by Sacramento’s stream,
    What mem’ries sweet its music brings—
The vows of love, its smiles and tears,
    Hang o’er this harp of broken strings.
It speaks, and midst her blushing fears
    The beauteous one before me stands!
Pure spirit in her downcast eyes,
    And like twin doves her folded hands!
It breathes again—and at my side
    She kneels, with grace divinely rare—
Then showering kisses on my lips,
    She hides our busses with her hair;
Then trembling with delight, she flings
    Her beauteous self into my arms,
As if o’erpowered, she sought for wings
    To hide her from her conscious charms!
It breathes once more, and bowed in grief,
    The bloom has left her cheek forever,
While, like my broken harp-strings now,
    Behold her form with feeling quiver!
She turns her face o’errun with tears,
    To him that silent bends above her,
And, by the sweets of other years,
    Entreats him still, oh, still to love her!
He loves her still—but darkness falls
    Upon his ruined fortunes now,
And ’t is his exile doom to flee.
    The dews, like death, are on his brow,
And cold the pang about his heart
    Oh, cease—to die is agony:
’T is more than death when loved ones part!
Well may this harp of broken strings
    Seem sweet to me by this lonely shore.
When like a spirit it breaks forth,
    And speaks of beauty evermore!
When like a spirit it evokes
    The buried joys of early youth,
And clothes the shrines of early love,
    With all the radiant light of truth!"

                        Am, eh,
Ioruba or
Ewe,
Hausa or
Ashanti,
Bantu or
Mandinga,
Or Sudanese.
They don’t know who Ioio. Ioio
the ordinary little
                        Negrito,
Traded for tobacco, he,
Chewing on a tamarind stick.
Tobacco, it make me sneeze. No
Ethiopian prince, me,
But they catch me in tribe
                        War, make
slavery, shrimp they call

Monkey in the tamarind tree, him

                        Reis, you
                        Joke,
Trade him for tobacco and
                        Sweet brandy,
Master, him see me
                        Scribbling
                        Secret
                        Language, he
say, Ioio, you most
                        Devious little
                        Fool,
Ioio, you most dubious
                        Little fool.
Him give me lashings.
Rebel-monk, that Benedito, him
see the lashings.
Him a one big man, that is
                        The truth.
I think him there lash me
                        More.
Him buy me with gold
                        Shavings,
Make Ioio free.
And now I here in these
                        Cavern, and
now I write down
                        Everyone story in
these secret language. You know
these secret

Eh, who you to know these
                        Secret
                        Writing?
Eh, who you to make good
                        Sense of
these imbroglio? Wise
man he say such one as 
you
He come here these cavern make
good sense of these
Imbroglio
I am Ioio, me.
I speak pidgin Portuguee. Tell
me your tale, Senhor.
I know already who you are."
"“Song for Almeyda,” II.","In these caverns, Almeyda, are the 
waters that heal and a man-of-
many-names who claims
That you are safe
With the wise woman Zibatra, an old
friend of his and
                       Prophetess.
Wise men and women know each
                       Other,
As if they were drops of the
                       Same water.
These leaves I chew and 
dream of you
Or see you in waking.
You oil me with healing oil. The
man-of-many-names says that these
wounds are
                      Not deep,
Shoulder wounds,
Almeyda,
And that I’ve come here not
                      For the wounds but
for the spirit’s
                      Healing.
Zibatra, who is this
                      Zibatra?
A wise woman, he says, an old
acquaintance, though they’ve 
never met.
But wise men and women know
each other, 
As if they were
Seeds from the same pod. Are
you somewhere in
                     Alagoas?
Are you hidden in the
                     Forest?
But you oil me with healing oil.
Do I dream?
I do not dream; I look
Upon you with favor,
Com bons olhos.
Here, to talk of love is
                     Improper, to
kiss is impropriety. We are
Africans, says
                     Ovimbundo.
And war and love don’t mix. But I
must call you Amante
                     Anyhow.
Almeyda, Amante. Is this
                     Treachery?
The man-of-many-names is
scandalized by kisses.
Only Europeans caress with
                     Kisses.
In this New World,
You oil me with healing oil, and
kiss the wounds on my 
                     Shoulders. 
But they are not deep
                     Wounds,
Almeyda.
Do you hear the congadas? We
coronate a king.
But here we are all kings and
all servants too.
I do not make spears as in 
                     Palmares,
Or make the poison to tip
                     Them with, though
there are others who
                     Make spears
                     And
Repair muskets.
In dreams, I return to
                     Alagoas
To search for you.
But Ovimbundo, our leader
                     Here,
Says that for now,
It is best we both stay
                     Hidden
For Jorge Velho’s regiment
                     Of petitioners is
still scattered, hunting
                     Us, the
                     Palmaristas,
And searching the Barriga
                     Range.
The war is not ended. And
so I keep to this
                     Stronghold,
For it is best not to even
inadvertently lead the enemy
here.
So keep to your stronghold,
                     Almeyda.
They are still searching for us, even
along the frontier.
I dream you have been
                     Captured, and
Angola and Cabinda,
Palmaristas who have also
                     Been
Given refuge here
Confirm the wisdom of
the wise man and so I
Keep to this stronghold. It
would be rash, he says,
To seek you now, Amante, so keep
to your stronghold, and I’ll keep to
mine. 
Am I drugged?
There was a time I’d not have
listened even to King
                     Zumbi
If he gave me such an order. I’d have
searched every
                     Polegada
Of the Barriga range. Am I
not a free man?
Eu não sou um homem livre?
But by now, he says, they
know that I’m a 
                     Palmarista
                     Too.
But by now, he says,
The petitioners have revoked
                     My free
                     Papers.
Using freedom, they say, to
facilitate conspirators
                     Against the 
                     King!
And is not the king a
                     Conspirator
                     Against us?
       Would not the king trade
                     Anyone of us 
For a keg of English brandy?
Ovimbundo prophesies a time of no
slave traders
No slave peddlers, no
slave merchants, bartering
us for Sugar
Tobacco
Brandy
Flour
Manioc
Rum
Hides
Fish
Lumber
Gold 
Leather
Dried meat
Silk
Imported carpets
Pepper
Firearms
And when we Africans
Build our own cities
Not hidden in some forest or the
Barriga range
But cities in the open even
along the frontier from
Bahia to Rio from
Pernambuco to 
                      Jigonhonha from
Piaui to Maranhao from Para to
Rio Grande from Minas Gerais
to
                      Sergipe.
But between now and then,
                      Almeyda,
More slave agents
And more Captain Velhos than we
can count on all our
                      Fists.
O quilombo dos Palmares.
And not just the chalked
                      Faces,
Even pretos.
If color’s not contagious, then
slavery is.
Do I dare tell you of
King Adarunga?
But the collaborators and
                      The
                      Conspirators
Always have the same faces. Here, I
do not plan war
                      Strategems. In
Palmares, I knew King
                      Zumbi,
But here I do not know the
                      King. 
Perhaps they think it’s
easier not to have
                      Traitors,
If everyone thinks that
                      Everyone’s the
                      King,
So when they coronate the King,
They coronate us all!
Ovimbundo
And Bacongo and 
Quimbundo, Pedro
And Nascimiento
And Honorio,
Mandinga,
And Ioio, and
Xingar.
Here, I do not make spears or
repair firearms,
I grow yams, and
santonica,
And Indian pepper, and
agapanthus.
(Should I dare call it
The African love-flower?) And
I tend the king’s
                     Horses.
Horses are better than 
                     Spears,
Says Ovimbundo. Better 
than firearms. Though I
don’t know who the king
is,
Or what the horses are for.
You are rubbing me with
                     Healing oils,
                     Almeyda,
And I am planting
                     Agapanthus.
And we are in that New
                     Brazil
Building our own city, our
own free city. "
I Have Stood Up for You,"Being of your blood,
Through thick and thin,
      I have stood up for you.
When the world’s most devilish
Intrigue of humanity was set
And was coiling around you tighter and tighter—
      I have stood up for you.
When public sentiment was against you
And sent you to oblivion,
      I have stood up for you.
When the country was hysterically enraged
For defending your loved ones
And your birthright of priority—
      I have stood up for you.
When you were tagged as “Indians”
And outlawed creatures—
      I have stood up for you.
Haunted and hunted on thy domain,
With no chance of redress
But doomed, as though thy fate—
      I have stood up for you.
When you were described and pictured
And cartooned as cruel and savage—
      I have stood up for you.
When prejudice, hate and scorn
Sounded the keynote against you—
      I have stood up for you.
When starving and naked,
At the verge of your annihilation
By swords in the hands of criminals—
      I have stood up for you.
When the palefaces said
There was no hope for you—
      I have stood up for you.
When you were condemned and relegated
To the reservation system of hell—
      I have stood up for you.
When in prison and in bondage,
When you could neither speak nor see—
      I have stood up for you.
When decreed by the people across the sea
That you could neither learn nor be taught,
      I have stood up for you.
When it was put down black and white
That you could neither work nor support yourselves,
And that you were lazy and worthless—
      I have stood up for you.
When politics and greed were working you
For all that you were worth—
      I have stood up for you.
When everything you possessed was disappearing,
And your personal rights ignored—
      I have stood up for you.
As the Indian Bureau, like an octopus,
Sucked your very life blood,
      I have stood up for you.
For your freedom and citizenship,
By the abolishment of the Indian Bureau,
      I have stood up for you.
When the Indian Bureau says, “Were you freed
You would starve and be cheated”—
Only to feed its 7000 employees—
      I have stood up for you.
When you were judged “incompetent”
For freedom and citizenship by the Indian Bureau—
      I have stood up for you.
God knows that I am with thee day and night;
That is why I have stood up for you.
It might have been self-sacrifice.
It might have been the hand of God leading me.
Whatever it was, you have proven yourselves to be
What I have stood up for you to be."
The Dream of the Anti-Ekphrasis,"Three Palestinian Boys, Marwan, 1970
Death is no equalizer
Nothing is equal in the eyes of—
In the gaze of—
In the Of
  Where is the third beloved head
(It is where all of our heads go)
While they stand consequential as passports
(I have hurt myself within the borders of the page)
(I have done this so they may see me)
  Where are their legs their feet
(Where the soil ends and the dream begins)
I have painted myself green and mottled
I have asked my body to crumple and rupture
In the desire pulling my eyes to the paint they remain
Unreachable unreached and unreaching they remain
Where do they belong?
(Never in the marketplace of nations)
(Never in the deleterious exchange of hands)
(Never in my pitiful abject sight)
(Never in my soft abject palms)
The torsos joined into a picket line
Fused like butter in the crumpled building’s dead refrigerator
  Where am I to look at them this way
As though lying down for them
(Prostrate in the tall grass waiting to be discovered)
And my hands so pitiful and empty
The language of survival cold within my teeth
Whatever I am seeking it is nowhere
And whoever I wish to be is dead
(I should kiss each of their cheeks)
(I should kiss them)
(I should have kissed them)
I should not have been born
  And where do they belong?
In the gentle abjection of the cactus spine a bird impaled upon it
In the blood leaking from the general’s eyes as he gurgles
In the survival language cracking my teeth to flee my mouth
In the folding and crumpling of my fingers as they break
(Are broken)"
The Tejano Considers Seeds,"To flower from seeds,
to make roots from water
means there’s a tending
or soft beginning like tenderness.
Delicate young germination
from soil. My baby. My soil as a noun.
A piece of ground from the Old French for sol.
A native lightness. The sol rises in Texas too.

Rising like a verb, there’s no stillness
to the threshold—another word for the bottom of a door,
meaning there’s a sill soiled. A sill or cut timber. Laid
& crossed over. To soil a verb meaning
there is original sin, meaning before dirt
there was cleanliness. No entry, no violation
of God. A mess of seeds that needs
water. Give us a mess of thick mud. 
            Que chiquero.             Standing still like a cleansing
after a gentle roll-around. Wallowing in a field
como un puerco. Madrugando            con hambre—
I am your shepherd. I am ready for battle
with the pastured sky
you fought so hard against
their beanstalks growing upside down, reaching for hell."
"Nálí, Her Solo","next to her bed her instrument sleeps
covered for the night like a bird in a cage
night passes . . . . . . the light returns
she pulls the cover away
dust motes dance in the air
she tunes her loom
strums the white parallel lines
with a flick of her wrist
each string must vibrate
layers of notes grow upward
tamp tamp tamp tamp
she listens for the right pitch
inserts the percussion fork into
the parallel lines that lead upward
she pulls down mountains, stars, lightning, storm patterns
tamp tamp tamp tamp
she is mythic soloist, storyteller, mathematician
her concert transforms us
we soften like lambskin"
The Laureate Fellows’ Collaborative Poem,"A cross-country, exquisite corpse by thirteen regional poet laureate fellows from our 2021-2022 cohort examining the role of a laureate in community.

Always a shift in definitions:
auteur author into community worker, 
not we are here to hear your voice
but are here to give us voice
(we seem to have mislaid it on the way
to society, did you bring a flashlight?)
Call it impropriety — we aim to misbehave.
To remind you all your money is no remedy
for the grave.

  A Poet Laureate is
a servant's heart
on a stark canvas
of parchment. The role
is honey in the mouth and bitter
in the belly. We are an unfolding
scroll of judgment
pronounced
in sacred tones.

Laureate of faith found her—
                                        ancient stone under the moon
without breath — wind abandoned
in her core fossilized poems recall
words hemorrhaging forests

I was taught: heart
with mind speaks truth. Dark-
                  bright, bright-dark,
                  & the infinite sheen
of the in-between. Who
am I, are you, to lift
                  our voice?
                  With calloused hands
& histories we carry each
other. We honor our dead. We gather
                  & plant the seeds, hoping to bend
                  time to a softer curve.

and I can’t help but believe these too
are a lesson in speaking of sooth
                creation to nature
                to observation
                to writing it down
                to a poem it becomes
the writer's blood filling with warmth
to have created and continued
to have lived with bronze sights
on a frozen morning

Singing voices speak,

[I’m happiest now when most away],"I’m happiest now when most away
I can tear my soul from its mould of clay,
On a windy night when the moon is bright,
And my eye can wander through worlds of light.
When I am not, and none beside,
   Nor earth, nor sea, nor cloudless sky,
But only spirit wandering wide
   Through infinite immensity."
[Weaned from life and flown away],"Weaned from life and flown away
In the morning of thy day,
Bound in everlasting gloom,
Buried in a hapless tomb.
Yet upon thy bended knee
Thank the power that banished thee;
Chain and bar and dungeon wall
Saved thee from a deadlier thrall.
Thank the power that made thee part
Ere that parting broke thy heart.
Wildly rushed the mountain spring
From its source of fern and ling;
How invincible its roar,
Had its waters worn the shore."
The Wall,"for J.B. 
The wall surrounding them they never saw;
The angels, often. Angels were as common
As birds or butterflies, but looked more human.
As long as the wings were furled, they felt no awe.
Beasts, too, were friendly. They could find no flaw
In all of Eden: this was the first omen.
The second was the dream which woke the woman.
She dreamed she saw the lion sharpen his claw.
As for the fruit, it had no taste at all.
They had been warned of what was bound to happen.
They had been told of something called the world.
They had been told and told about the wall.
They saw it now; the gate was standing open.
As they advanced, the giant wings unfurled."
Sestina on Six Words by Weldon Kees,"I often wonder about the others,
Where they are bound for on the voyage,
What is the reason for their silence,
Was there some reason to go away?
It may be they carry a dark burden,
Expect some harm, or have done harm.
How can we show them we mean no harm?
Approach them? But they shy from others.
Offer, perhaps, to share the burden?
They change the subject to the voyage,
Or turn abruptly, walk away,
To brood against the rail in silence.
What is defeated by their silence
More than love, less than harm?
Many already are looking their way,
Pretending not to. Eyes of others
Will follow them now the whole voyage
And add a little to the burden.
Others touch hands to ease the burden,
Or stroll, companionable in silence,
Counting the stars which bless the voyage,
But let the foghorn speak of harm,
Their hearts will stammer like the others’,
Their hands seem in each other’s way.
It is so obvious, in a way.
Each is alone, each with his burden.
To others they are always others,
And they can never break the silence,
Say, lightly, thou, but to their harm
Although they make many a voyage.
What do they wish for from the voyage
But to awaken far away
By miracle free from every harm,
Hearing at dawn that sweet burden
The birds cry after a long silence?
Where is that country not like others?
There is no way to ease the burden.
The voyage leads on from harm to harm,
A land of others and of silence."
109 Bermuda,"  I build it, I build the house, I build the eaves, I build the roof where we looked for stars, I build the ever-clogged gutters for which no time could be found, I build the brick face and the curb appeal, I build the door slamming open as the child flew forth into what the window framed, the streets calling my name, I build the lintel where they bent their heads in whispers, I build the climb and precarious, I build the sky with its tiny points of light which might be my mother coming home at last, I build the last two-story she might ever own clean and free, I build the longing, I build the view to the wicked canal, I build the red front porch where the bottle fell and bled its wine, where the last chance of reconciliation also shattered and never forget it was my fault, my careless, which left the dark red stain, I build the sometime home now paved over and prime real-estate condominium, I build the memory like something I can inhabit, and the sawgrass he planted and the lemon trees she cherished, perhaps if I build it there will finally be room for the broken, the missing, therein to dwell."
Gahé Dzíł / Mountain Spirits,"always for my family
Circling around flames and dancing with the blazes
Encumbering sparks take flight into the night sky,
A swirling twinkle resembling a star crown
Moving into empty canopies resembling ghosts
A threshold colossal structure with rusty bells shakes
the sound of fire sings lingering beyond the flames
sent across the mountain and valleys
These spirits come from the mountains and move towards
the south, between the sacred narrow canyons,
The Sierra Madre Canyon walls sing in their echoes
A medicine reveals a stick and brings the wall down
For the Ndé—the people who wandered into night
Ascending towards the ending sky and onto the lost land
Losing their tongues and eyes they consume the mountain
Air and waters trying to heal all their lungs that bellowed
Outward against the slow breezes and heavy breaths
A hundred years the spirits protected them from
the sixteenth calvary who then believed, in all their hearts,
a good Injun was a dead Injun. Even then the spirits protected
the people for another twenty-seven years until they reached
                                    —their forced destination
A place where cutting their hair died as the spirits watched
The people searched the underground catacombs of St. Augustine
While hearing the waves crash against the stone walls
Outside the thick walls, the people were exposed
To yellow fever and malaria, they died and died
                                    —some survived
After thirty more years the people returned to their homeland
closer to the Skeleton Canyons where an epic scribed
on the mountain walls called back their ancestors
At night the drumming echoed like the murmur inside
Their bodies hearing the loud thumps come and go
In 1986 the people returned to their original place
                                                —entering the ancient canyons
                                                —honoring those killed
                                                —remembering the mountains
At night the sparks fly high as the people hear those rusty bells
and hollow songs        —they feel the drums and footsteps reverberate
Inside their veins every time, they look to the mountains"
Song of the Oktahutche,"Far, far, far are my silver waters drawn;
       The hills embrace me loth to let me go;
The maidens think me fair to look upon,
       And trees lean over glad to hear me flow.
Thro’ field and valley, green because of me,
       I wander, wander to the distant sea.
Thro’ lonely places and thro’ crowded ways;
       Thro’ noise of strife and thro’ the solitude,
And on thro’ cloudy days and sunny days,
       I journey till I meet, in sisterhood,
The broad Canadian, red with the sunset,
       Now calm, now raging in a mighty fret!
On either hand, in a grand colonnade,
       The cottonwoods rise in the azure sky,
And purple mountains cast a purple shade
       As I, now grave, now laughing, pass them by;
And birds of air dip bright wings in my tide,
       In sunny reaches where I noiseless glide.
O’er shoals of mossy rocks and mussel shells,
       Blue over spacious beds of amber sand,
By cliffs and coves and glens where Echo dwells—
       Elusive spirit of the shadow-land—
Forever blest and blessing, do I go,
       A wid’ning in the morning’s roseate glow.
Though I sing my song in a minor key,
       Broad lands and fair attest the good I do;
Though I carry no white sails to the sea,
       Towns nestle in the vales I wander thro’;
And quails are whistling in the waving grain,
       And herds are scattered o’er the verdant plain."
Hurstonian Mythos 0.2: Custodial Spirits,"My mama, centaur-sometimes-mystic, sculpts me praying hands
I break open to score messy reminders into the flesh of a dark rock
surged upon, and overswept. 

Desperate palms in search of Zora’s feather-bed settle themselves 
around broom handles and wastebaskets. Consorts of La Madama 
surround us throwin’ whispered revivals against a spiral of owned objects. 

Coming for to carry me, coming for to claim, coming for to clean…"
Ars Poetica,"Because I know
Now: how it feels
To sip that small space
Between becoming
And being found."
Whitman,"I imagine him lying on his back,
gaze to the azure sky, white clouds—unlike
this grey New York on a rain-drenched day.
Notebook at his side, sheets splotched from an ink pen,
pipe in hand, hat off, wispy hair rustling in the wind.
Leaning on an elbow over wet dandelions, he slaps
at a buzzing fly. The poet reaches for language
until evening falls.
                                               At last he stands,
dusts off trousers, and heads for the pub. After an ale or two,
“Come to me,” he’ll whisper to a ginger-haired mate,
“when the gaslights grow dim.”
That was that—life, then, not fate.
Walking home, pondering the vastness of an indigo sky,
the poet falls in love,
the way old men fall in love, with unspoken desires
and hearts that break into clusters of stars;
with failing gaze, winks back at a bespectacled sight.
Illuminated streets were new.
Everything gleamed with the shine of progress,
railways and motor cars—
democracy in action. The nation belonged to men of ambition,
ladies and their heirs. He, with his rhymeless verses, pertained to no one,
or so he rigorously declared.
On a fair day a friend and he hiked through the woods,
vigorous in thought and perseverance.
They had wine and bread, clever banter. Perhaps
they swam in a river,
and while one read to the other
dried their flesh in the sun.
The poet felt young again on such days,
the feeling a treasure
to store with saved letters. 
He’d remain immortal that way,
virile in the minds of romantics.
Rhetorical questions were for lesser minds.
True pleasure came with soup served out of the kettle.
He himself had killed the turkey or duck,
plucked feathers, pulled out liver and gizzards.
Raw heart dropped on his own tongue.
Everything else went into the boiling pot.
Later, he’d call out, “It’s done!”
Meat melting off bone, potatoes and carrots
or love—which one?"
"heavy altar (no elevation),","a miracle trodden. The Crystal Diggers knew it to be true: reorient devotion to ground–uncontained,
in its own order. The walls were built only to catch its slipping holy, singing dually lean on into fervor.
Praise at the collapse. Breath of Burning, weightless silver saunters in gravitational cycloning downward,
toward that which is absorbent. & for this, what can you withstand? What will you let go?"
Drops Fell on the Roof,"                                        Translation by Tyehimba Jess with Ana Castillo
  Tic, tic, tic,
tic, tic, tic…
A stab
in the chest of the country
and the night didn’t blink
that Valentine’s Day.
A tic, tic, tic fell on the roof
and no one slept, not my love, not the dog, not me
with the news of the latest massacre.
Seventeen children lost their lives.
Students, poets, leaders of the future,
it was seventeen souls that time.
Seventeen, count them in their coffins,
that will never grow older.
Seventeen sons and daughters. Count, if you can,
the screams of the parents and the people.
Domestic terrorism so rampant
in a place that calls itself democracy,
that has made death banal. It began centuries ago.
Men with weapons, haters of humanity, lovers of power
now, they take off their masks, their costumes,
with the blessing of Mr. President. Tic, tic, tic…
drops fell from the sky, and nobody slept,
not my love, not the dog, not me."
Othering,"Having a light supper of peanut butter and wild berry jam
on water table crackers while watching PBS,
a woman who wrote a book came on.
She talked about married Indian women,
her curiosity about them.
They were private, at first, she said.
It took time to gain trust
and signed consents,
everything on the up and up, you understand.
How bloody “Margaret Mead” of her,
how “Jane Goodall,” I thought,
going over to make tea, draw blinds,
bring in the dogs for the night.
After all, I mused, if her subjects—
multilingual, educated, well-traveled—
wished for strangers to know
whether they watched porn,
places where they made love,
how they interacted with in-laws
and reared children,
they’d write their own accounts.
Instead, perhaps sometime
they’d document
the impudent guest
who came to town
for the sole purpose
of blabbing about all that went on
behind closed doors."
What Is Your Writing Process?,"With mop in one hand,
cocktail in the other,
at 9:00 a.m. or night,
flies swatted,
roach corpses swept.
Lola Beltrán belts “Mi ranchito”
through house speakers
from room to room.
I hum off key.
Mares fed, dogs let out,
sun beating on the flat roof,
moon rising behind a cloud—
verses take form."
Drifting,"And now the sun in tinted splendor sank,
  The west was all aglow with crimson light;
The bay seemed like a sheet of burnished gold,
  Its waters glistened with such radiance bright.
At anchor lay the yachts with snow-white sails,
  Outlined against the glowing, rose-hued sky.
No ripple stirred the waters’ calm repose
  Save when a tiny craft sped lightly by.
Our boat was drifting slowly, gently round,
  To rest secure till evening shadows fell;
No sound disturbed the stillness of the air,
  Save the soft chiming of the vesper bell.
Yes, drifting, drifting; and I thought that life,
  When nearing death, is like the sunset sky:
And death is but the slow, sure drifting in
  To rest far more securely, by and by.
Then let me drift along the Bay of Time,
  Till my last sun shall set in glowing light;
Let me cast anchor where no shadows fall,
  Forever moored within Heaven’s harbor bright."
Untitled for a Reason,"you are curled under
unconsummated kiss,
folded into the violence
of blueberries crushed
between teeth, dying
sugars of once growing
fruit, and i let it linger.
your hands map
a body that requires
no discovery,
nor conquest.
you speak softened
drama of fury and frenzy,
quiet underbelly, light
beaming into peaceful
dark interrupted by
minor collisions
bodies were built
to withstand. you,
looping daydreams
and gasps silent
under skin until
partitions of distance
and judgment lapse
into surreptitious mist.
you are the laugh
that falls orange
against my cheek
and dries slight
sweat cooling.
in the smallest fleck
of imagination, you
become a dream
i needed to recall
as muscles found
new persistence
flexing in a crucible
where the world
expands beyond
the steady scruff
of sandpaper
graded routine. you,
small map unfolding
a globe that vanished
within mundane block.
you open a door
with a word, if any,
or a pause hanging
like an ornament
in your full smirk."
Tendril,"& just the vermillion
flicker of cannas near the pane.
Our bodies too, plateaued;
my hole, newly bloomless.
Outdoors, further out, a wren
winnows, the mesquite
on whose yielding limbs the all-
but-tender fowl rests
flexes, in cold as in darkness . . .
Time, like desire, expands too—
no? My lover, nodding gently,
shakes the leaves, &
A little softer. A little softer now—
A little softer, for what’s been torn."
The White Paws,"The fox with broken legs has a gift others do not. He removes his paws and they go walking through the woods at night alone. The paws stop to touch pondwater, to brush a blade of saltgrass. They tap the backs of passing beetles in the dark. At dawn, they return to the fox, whispering of rabbits curled in damp caverns, of green oak leaves and sand. The fox listens carefully; he gleans secrets of the world this way. He learns of the earth without lifting his nose from his long, broken limbs. Always, when the paws return they say we missed you, always he listens. How young, how simple they seem beside his face which is mottled and pocked. He gentles the paws like children. He hopes when he dies they live on without him. When his bones rattle and shake in wind, he hopes the paws walk through autumn leaves, pad softly through newfallen snow. He dreams they will drift across a black lake dappled with rain; that, above it, they’ll rise; they’ll glow like four pale moons."
Resistors,"I just felt like he was fighting us with his machine.
             —Nellie Jo David
In Guadalajara to see where Motorola took the line
            my grandmother worked on, I can’t find the site
but spend the days in naves of a deconsecrated church
looking up at frescoes by Orozco. Here is a horse:
            a tow chain for tail, train piston for hock & hoof.
Over murdered Mexica, Cortez stands: lug nut hips
& kneecaps, gauntleted hand at the sword hilt, silver
            as a knot of solder. Opposite him: the Franciscan
& his Latin cross—miter-sawed angles hewn down
to dagger point—& an angel in assembly-line armor
            lifting a bloodied banner with the stenciled letters
of an alphabet, the one I must have started learning,
sing-song in the pitch & timbre of milk teeth, at 48th
            & Willetta, a one-bedroom duplex west of Papago’s
greasewood & buttes of sandstone & a block down
from the Motorola where my grandmother punched
            in nights to look after a conveyor of semiconductors—
those nascent ancient rotaries strung up to starlight
& empire (gaslighting like that Gast painting of progress
            & whiteness wrapped in telegraph wire, lithe & looping
as cake shop box string). No wall on O’odham land,
I hear the woman today protest from the bucket
            of a front-end loader—a Caterpillar, by her presence,
dumbstruck on tread wheels tall as vault doors, its maw
metal hollow, a confessional or old Mountain Bell
            phone booth she stepped into amid the felled saguaro
& ribs of organ pipe. Her body where dirt goes says
her body is the land the wall wants to eat. I stream this—
            download by data plan, by bandwidth, from the cloud
servers deep in their grid deserts to the crystalline
& rare earth minerals making my cell phone
            black box theater, making her code, making her
algorithm—both soprano & Mario Savio—the solder
seemingly quantum leap from soldada & solidarity.
            Still, I remember the ram’s horn baritone in my nana’s
King James, imagine her driving those years with riders
to shepherd the sound through solid state & know
            the harder truth: the defiant mic this woman makes,
resonates with her body beneath the digger’s teeth."
White Blossoms,"Take me as I drive alone
through the dark countryside.
As my strong beams clear a path,
picking out fences, weeds, late
flowering trees, everything
that streams back into the past
without sound, I smell the grass
and the rich chemical sleep
of the fields. An open moon
sails above, and a stalk
of red lights blinks, miles away.
It is at such moments I 
am called, in a voice so pure
I have to close my eyes, and enter
the breathing darkness just beyond
my headlights. I have come back,
to think, to something I had
almost forgotten, a mouth
that waits patiently, sighs, speaks
and falls silent. No one else
is alive. The blossoms are
white, and I am almost there. "
There,"It is deep summer. Far out
at sea, the young squalls darken
and roll, plunging northward,
threatening everything. I see
the Atlantic moving in slow
contemplative fury
against the rocks, the beaten
headlands, and the towns sunk deep
in a blind northern light. Here, 
far inland, in the mountains
of Mexico, it is raining
hard, battering the soft mouths
of flowers. I am sullen, dumb,
ungovernable. I taste myself
and I taste those winds, uprisings
of salt and ice, of great trees
brought down, of houses and cries
lost in the storm; and what breaks
on that black shore breaks in me. "
After Hours,"Not yet five, and the light
is going fast. Milky and veined
a thin frost covers the flooded 
ruts of the driveway, the grass
bends to the winter night. Her face
is before me now; I see it
in the misted glass, the same
impossible smile and I can feel
again on my bare shoulder
the dew of her breath. We made
a life in two years, a sky
and the very trees, lost in thought.
I know what it is, to be 
alone, to have asked for everything, 
and to do without, to search
the air for a face that slipped away,
to wait, and what it exacts.
I don’t fear it, I say,
but I do, and this night
the wind against the window
and the top branches thrashing about
enter my life and I see
the coming time loose and dark
above me, with new strength."
A Bedtime Story,"Accidents will happen. Still, in time,
The rigors of mortality will chill
The piping channels of the blood and spin
Around the brain a cold and covering skin.
Then one might not remember pain so well;
One could sit back, and life, if not sublime,
Would be a sleep to dream pleasantly in,
Enlarging on the heroics of one’s prime.
Nothing about longevity is heroic.
When he was eighty, Sophocles sighed, and said,
“This well loved instrument’s finally out of tune.
Well, I am old, and have my work.” And soon
Wrote Oedipus Rex, but in the night, in bed—
Well, it would test the most brave, the most stoic:
His genitals were wrinkled as a prune,
His nerves gone dull and every thought prosaic.
Then there was Stanley Ketchel, whose reckless love
And subsequent early death preserved his youth
And left his classic body middleweight slim.
Graceful and powerful we remember him,
His battering fists telling the brutal truth.
But there are countless tales. It is enough
To learn the fate of vigorous life and limb
And lose it in grandiose rough stuff.
Ah, if only the dawn had thought to ask
For something more, for supple muscles, say,
An ageless heart to keep the flesh and blood
Robust as well as living for the good
Of her fair-haired boy, who came to hate the day,
The endless afternoon, the endless dusk,
That left him frozen in his fossilhood,
His deathless eyes bright in his bitten mask.
The specter of an old man’s ugly phiz
Drifts in the gloom, wearing a dreadful smile.
Regard this silly ghost as he goes by:
Was he not thoughtless once as you and I
Of what must happen in a little while,
Who now despairs that he is come to this?
Shall you and I instruct him how to die?
Come close, come closer, kill me with a kiss.
 "
The Funeral Home,"In the environs of the funeral home
The smell of death was absent. All there was
Was flowers rioting, the odors blown
Palpable as a blossom into the face,
To be crushed, to overpower—as if the grass
Already covered the nostrils in that place.

Hyacinths, larkspur, irises, flags of summer
Freshening and quickening in the little
Dawn breeze, and opening to a bee’s clamor
The delicate parts, just now fragrantly ready,
And now beginning to die, the damp petal
Swaying a little with the weight of the bee’s body—

Let them cut these flowers. Let them be ruddy
And sunlit gold and white and let them be
Heaped up and overflowing over the body
Waiting to be put down. To be unborn.
Something is sprouting in dark mahogany
Out of them—edged, and shining like a thorn.
   "
Twilight Pain,"I have died so many midnight moons,
most of night soil not realized until later.
In peculiar sleep, caught by a night-latched
mind like some dark dew on the breaching hips,
resemble a red blossom, birth & blood is the rose.
I pang & I hurt but a summons in black snow,
of ukpik, calls as white snow owls on black earth melt,
our catching eyes lock in deadbolt time & ukpik calls
moonlight across tundra, on a level plain
with a photoreceptor stimulated by light
floating to the blue hue of dawn.
At daybreak, my night person fades,
my drowsiness & lethargic body
rises to alleviate the deep
nightlong pain of restlessness.
It’s the light through purple celestial bodies
belonging to the daytime,
diurnal cycle, of wavelengths dancing
in & out nightmarish, lunacy.
Dancing with my namesake, there.
Living in the sienna’s myriad
mazes lost beyond found, alive but mostly dead.
I am brushstrokes of a painting half-finished.
What is not clear to me is the order
by which humans now go by.
Sometimes my tunicate, saclike body
fills with ill plague.
Illness disperses, dispels, vanishes in paint on a canvas
no different than multicolored wildflowers.
Distinguished only to a few,
not all flowers accounted for or named just yet.
There for a reason. I don’t know why,
how, when they came,
when they chose to leave
but I do know & wait.
I live in a dugout in the cliffs next to the ocean,
bluffs receding filling with seawater rising
from melting glacial ice. Across the inlet seal island
not far from my dugout.
They bark and sun themselves all day,
but are in constant fear of losing ground to walrus.
The tons of blubber could squash a seal
out of sheer creature comfort.
Walrus take over any small island
rolling around in the sand;
waiting for the coming schools of fish
voraciously hungry, grunting to the sway of wind,
sea of the long twilight hours."
Spring Thaw,"A remnant conceals
things I can’t
change, a blue
glacial memory
reveals:
              light’s sharp edges—
                         I lean.
As if my body—
subdued
by brittle, gutter, brim
ice. Finding a chickadee’s
feather on a snowflake,
while lost in slumberous,
smooth, blue, smoke.
             I awaken to a chirping,
             flock fly overhead.
             Indeed grace."
Anthropocene Years,"Here Cape Lisburne
Or maybe not there.
Kaktovik then
on New Siberian Islands.
Here not here.
Elsewhere but not anywhere.
But somewhere like Cape Chelynskin;
or White Island; yes, set the route due north.
As my compass taps out of bearing in circles.
Here Novaya Zemlya. A gyroscope.
Here on the boreal island, Norway.
Wherever it is it’s warm.
Here choking on acidic air.
Here Greenland, Jan Mayen.
No it’s Disko.
Here Canada.
Baffin Island.
Grinnell Lake.
Minto Inlet.
Place fogged lenses on telescopic eyes.
Here brilliant colors of pollution so high.
Here in the melt sun, heaving waters of ocean and sea.
Here start ending double-rate heat     to sweat & yet, not yet.
Here wake-up there not here."
A Prodigal,"My heart forgot its God for love of you, 
   And you forgot me, other loves to learn; 
Now through a wilderness of thorn and rue
   Back to my God I turn. 
And just because my God forgets the past, 
   And in forgetting does not ask to know
Why I once left His arms for yours, at last
   Back to my God I go. "
At Crow's Nest Pass,"At Crow’s Nest Pass the mountains rend
Themselves apart, the rivers wend
    A lawless course about their feet, 
    And breaking into torrents beat
In useless fury where they blend
    At Crow’s Nest Pass. 
The nesting eagle, wise, discreet, 
Wings up the gorge’s lone retreat
And makes some barren crag her friend
    At Crow's Nest Pass. 
Uncertain clouds, half-high, suspend
Their shifting vapours, and contend
   With rocks that suffer not defeat; 
   And snows, and suns, and mad winds meet
To battle where the cliffs defend
   At Crow’s Nest Pass. "
The City and the Sea,"                       I 

To none the city bends a servile knee; 
   Purse-proud and scornful, on her heights she stands, 
And at her feet the great white moaning sea 
   Shoulders incessantly the grey-gold sands,—
One the Almighty’s a child since time began, 
   And one the might of Mammon, born of clods; 
For all the city is the work of man, 
   But all the sea is God’s. 

                       II

And she—between the ocean and the town—
   Lies cursed of one and by the other blest: 
Her staring eyes, her long drenched hair, her gown, 
   Sea-laved and soiled and dank above her breast. 
She, image of her God since life began, 
   She, but the child of Mammon, born of clods, 
Her broken body spoiled and spurned of man, 
   But her sweet soul is God’s. "
Good-Bye,"Sounds of the seas grow fainter,
   Sounds of the sands have sped; 
The sweep of gales,
The far white sails, 
   Are silent, spent and dead. 

Sounds of the days of summer
   Murmur and die away, 
And distance hides
The long, low tides, 
  As night shuts out the day. "
The Flight of the Crows,"The autumn afternoon is dying o’er
   The quiet western valley where I lie
Beneath the maples on the river shore,
   Where tinted leaves, blue waters and fair sky
   Environ all; and far above some birds are flying by

To seek their evening haven in the breast
   And calm embrace of silence, while they sing
Te Deums to the night, invoking rest
   For busy chirping voice and tired wing—
   And in the hush of sleeping trees their sleeping cradles swing.

In forest arms the night will soonest creep,
   Where sombre pines a lullaby intone,
Where Nature’s children curl themselves to sleep,
   And all is still at last, save where alone
   A band of black, belated crows arrive from lands unknown.

Strange sojourn has been theirs since waking day,
   Strange sights and cities in their wanderings blend
With fields of yellow maize, and leagues away
   With rivers where their sweeping waters wend
   Past velvet banks to rocky shores, in cañons bold to end.

O’er what vast lakes that stretch superbly dead,
   Till lashed to life by storm-clouds, have they flown?
In what wild lands, in laggard flight have led
   Their aërial career unseen, unknown,
   ’Till now with twilight come their cries in lonely monotone?

The flapping of their pinions in the air
   Dies in the hush of distance, while they light
Within the fir tops, weirdly black and bare,
   That stand with giant strength and peerless height,
   To shelter fairy, bird and beast throughout the closing night.

Strange black and princely pirates of the skies,
   Would that your wind-tossed travels I could know!
Would that my soul could see, and, seeing, rise
   To unrestricted life where ebb and flow
   Of Nature’s pulse would constitute a wider life below!

Could I but live just here in Freedom’s arms,
   A kingly life without a sovereign’s care!
Vain dreams! Day hides with closing wings her charms,
   And all is cradled in repose, save where
   Yon band of black, belated crows still frets the evening air."
Prairie Greyhounds,"C.P.R. “No. 1,” Westbound
      I swing to the sunset land—
The world of prairie, the world of plain,
The world of promise and hope and gain,
The world of gold, and the world of grain,
      And the world of the willing hand.
      I carry the brave and bold—
The one who works for the nation's bread,
The one whose past is a thing that's dead,
The one who battles and beats ahead,
      And the one who goes for gold.
      I swing to the “Land to Be,”
I am the power that laid its floors,
I am the guide to its western stores,
I am the key to its golden doors,
      That open alone to me.
C.P.R. “No. 2,” Eastbound
      I swing to the land of mourn;
The grey old east with its grey old seas,
The land of leisure, the land of ease,
The land of flowers and fruits and trees,
      And the place where we were born.
      Freighted with wealth I come;
For he who many a moon has spent
Far out west on adventure bent,
With well-worn pick and a folded tent,
      Is bringing his bullion home.
      I never will be renowned,
As my twin that swings to the western marts,
For I am she of the humbler parts,
But I am the joy of the waiting hearts;
      For I am the Homeward-bound."
Erie Waters,"A dash of yellow sand,
Wind-scattered and sun-tanned;
Some waves that curl and cream along the margin of the strand;
And, creeping close to these
Long shores that lounge at ease,
Old Erie rocks and ripples to a fresh sou’-western breeze.
A sky of blue and grey;
Some stormy clouds that play
At scurrying up with ragged edge, then laughing blow away,
Just leaving in their trail
Some snatches of a gale;
To whistling summer winds we lift a single daring sail.
O! wind so sweet and swift,
O! danger-freighted gift
Bestowed on Erie with her waves that foam and fall and lift,
We laugh in your wild face,
And break into a race
With flying clouds and tossing gulls that weave and interlace."
The Corn Husker,"Hard by the Indian lodges, where the bush
    Breaks in a clearing, through ill-fashioned fields,
She comes to labour, when the first still hush
    Of autumn follows large and recent yields.
Age in her fingers, hunger in her face,
    Her shoulder stopped with weight of work and years,
But rich in tawny coloring of her race,
    She comes a-field to strip the purple ears.
And all her thoughts are with the days gone by,
    Ere might's injustice banished from their lands
Her people, that to-day unheeded lie,
    Like the dead husks that rustle through her hands."
Lullaby of the Iroquois,"Little born baby-bird, lapped in your nest,
      Wrapped in your nest,
      Strapped in your nest,
Your straight little cradle-board rocks you to rest;
      Its hands are your nest;
      Its bands are your nest;
It swings from the down-bending branch of the oak;
You watch the camp flame, and the curling grey smoke;
But, oh, for your pretty black eyes sleep is best,—
Little brown baby of mind, go to rest.
Little brown baby-bird swinging to sleep,
      Winging to sleep,
      Singing to sleep,
Your wonder-black eyes that so wide open keep,
      Shielding their sleep,
      Unyielding to sleep,
The heron is homing, the plover is still,
The night-owl calls from his haunt on the hill,
Afar the fox barks, afar the stars peep,—
Little brown baby of mine, go to sleep."
The Mariner,"'Wreck and stray and castaway.""—Swinburne.
      Once more adrift.
O'er dappling sea and broad lagoon,
O'er frowning cliff and yellow dune,
The long, warm lights of afternoon
      Like jewel dustings sift.
      Once more awake.
I dreamed an hour of port and quay,
Of anchorage not meant for me;
The sea, the sea, the hungry sea
      Came rolling up the break.
      Once more afloat.
The billows on my moorings press't
They drove me from my moment's rest,
And now a portless sea I breast,
      And shelterless my boat.
      Once more away.
The harbor lights are growing dim,
The shore is but a purple rim,
The sea outstretches grey and grim.
      Away, away, away!
      Once more at sea,
The old, old sea I used to sail,
The battling tide, the blowing gale,
The waves with ceaseless under-wail
      The life that used to be"
Beyond the Blue,"I
Speak of you, sir? You bet he did. Ben Fields was far too sound
To go back on a fellow just because he weren't around.
Why, sir, he thought a lot of you, and only three months back
Says he, ""The Squire will some time come a-snuffing out our track
And give us the surprise."" And so I got to thinking then
That any day you might drop down on Rove, and me, and Ben.
And now you've come for nothing, for the lad has left us two,
And six long weeks ago, sir, he went up beyond the blue.
Who's Rove? Oh, he's the collie, and the only thing on earth
That I will ever love again. Why, Squire, that dog is worth
More than you ever handled, and that's quite a piece, I know.
Ah, there the beggar is!—come here, you scalawag! and show
Your broken leg all bandaged up. Yes, sir, it's pretty sore;
I did it,—curse me,—and I think I feel the pain far more
Than him, for somehow I just feel as if I'd been untrue
To what my brother said before he went beyond the blue.
You see, the day before he died he says to me, ""Say, Ned,
Be sure you take good care of poor old Rover when I'm dead,
And maybe he will cheer your lonesome hours up a bit,
And when he takes to you just see that you're deserving it.""
Well, Squire, it wasn't any use. I tried, but couldn't get
The friendship of that collie, for I needed it, you bet.
I might as well have tried to get the moon to help me through,
For Rover's heart had gone with Ben, 'way up beyond the blue.
He never seemed to take to me nor follow me about,
For all I coaxed and petted, for my heart was starving out
For want of some companionship,—I thought, if only he
Would lick my hand or come and put his head aside my knee,
Perhaps his touch would scatter something of the gloom away.
But all along I had to live until there came a day
When, tired of the battle, as you'd have tired too,
I wished to heaven I'd gone with Ben, 'way up beyond the blue.
* * *
One morning I took out Ben's gun, and though I'd hunt all day,
And started through the cleaning for the bush that forward lay,
When something made me look around—I scarce believed my mind—
But, sure enough, the dog was following right close behind.
A feeling first of joy, and than a sharper, greater one
Of anger came, at knowing 'twas not me, but Ben's old gun,
That Rover was after,—well, sir, I just don't mind telling you,
But I forgot that moment Ben was up beyond the blue.
Perhaps it was but jealousy—perhaps it was despair,
But I just struck him with the gun and broke the bone right there;
And then, my very throat seemed choked, for he began to whine
With pain—God knows how tenderly I took that dog of mine
Up in my arms, and tore my old red necktie into bands
To bind the broken leg, while there he lay and licked my hands;
And though I cursed my soul, it was the brightest day I knew,
Or even cared to live, since Ben went up beyond the blue.
I tell you, Squire, I nursed him just as gently as could be,
And now I'm all the world to him, and he's the world to me.
Look, sir, at that big, noble soul, right in his faithful eyes,
The square, forgiving honestly that deep down in them lies.
Eh, Squire? What's that you say? He's got no should? I tell you, then,
He's grander and the's better than the mass of what's called men;
And I guess he stands a better chance that many of us do
Of seeing Ben some day again, 'way up beyond the blue."
Easter,"Lent gathers up her cloak of sombre shading
    In her reluctant hands.
Her beauty heightens, fairest in its fading,
    As pensively she stands 
Awaiting Easter’s benediction falling,
    Like silver stars at night, 
Before she can obey the summons calling
    Her to her upward flight, 
Awaiting Easter’s wings that she must borrow
    Ere she can hope to fly—
Those glorious wings that we shall see to-morrow
    Against the far, blue sky.
Has not the purple of her vesture’s lining
    Brought calm and rest to all? 
Has her dark robe had naught of golden shining
    Been naught but pleasure’s pall?
Who knows? Perhaps when to the world returning
    In youth’s light joyousness,
We’ll wear some rarer jewels we found burning
    In Lent’s black-bordered dress.
So hand in hand with fitful March she lingers
    To beg the crowning grace 
Of lifting with her pure and holy fingers
    The veil from April’s face. 
Sweet, rosy April—laughing, sighing, waiting
    Until the gateway swings,
And she and Lent can kiss between the grating
    Of Easter’s tissue wings.
Too brief the bliss—the parting comes with sorrow. 
    Good-bye dear Lent, good-bye! 
We’ll watch your fading wings outlined to-morrow
     Against the far blue sky. "
The Songster,"Music, music with throb and swing, 
   Of a plaintive note, and long; 
’Tis a note no human throat could sing, 
No harp with its dulcet golden string,—
Nor lute, nor lyre with liquid ring, 
   Is sweet as the robin’s song. 

He sings for the love of the season
   When the days grow warm and long, 
For the beautiful God-sent reason
   That his breast was born for song. 

Calling, calling so fresh and clear, 
   Through the song-sweet days of May; 
Warbling there, and whistling here, 
He swells his voice on the drinking ear, 
On the great, wide, pulsing atmosphere
   ’Till his music drowns the day. 

He sings for love of the season
   When the days grow warm and long, 
For the beautiful God-sent reason
   That his breast was born for song. "
Navajo Mountain,"If you close your eyes
and take a deep breath
you can hear the green sage sing
The gray stones beneath you
feel young again
The breeze watches
it all with her Mona Lisa smile
Naatsis’áán takes it all in
The thunder of a hundred hooves,
whoops and hollers of the crowd,
the intensity of the riders
as in the day of wild warriors 
on the warpath.
There are chicken pulls, children’s foot races,
Navajo cake, kneel-down bread, drum songs
K’é shakes the roots of the mountain,
which gives the people her blessing
as does Sun God
with gentle warm breath.
The story I heard
was that the people
returned from Hwéeldi
and found strangers in their home.
Ashiih Litso just a boy, risked everything
on one horse race
and was blessed by the Holy People.
Another story goes that the mountain protected the people,
keeping soldiers away
and they never had to make the Long Walk.
Whichever story you live by,
the mountain remembers.
Eehaniih celebrates her,
head of the earth."
Workworn,"Across the street, an humble woman lives;
To her ’tis little fortune ever gives;
Denied the wines of life, it puzzles me
To know how she can laugh so cheerily.
This morn I listened to her softly sing,
And, marvelling what this effect could bring
I looked: ’twas but the presence of a child
Who passed her gate, and looking in, had smiled.
But self-encrusted, I had failed to see
The child had also looked and laughed to me.
My lowly neighbour thought the smile God-sent,
And singing, through the toilsome hours she went.
O! weary singer, I have learned the wrong
Of taking gifts, and giving naught of song;
I thought my blessings scant, my mercies few,
Till I contrasted them with yours, and you;
To-day I counted much, yet wished it more—
While but a child’s bright smile was all your store,
If I had thought of all the stormy days,
That fill some lives that tread less favoured ways,
How little sunshine through their shadows gleamed,
My own dull life had much the brighter seemed;
If I had thought of all the eyes that weep
Through desolation, and still smiling keep,
That see so little pleasure, so much woe,
My own had laughed more often long ago;
If I had thought how leaden was the weight
Adversity lays at my kinsman’s gate,
Of that great cross my next door neighbour bears,
My thanks had been more frequent in my prayers;
If I had watched the woman o’er the way,
Workworn and old, who labours day by day,
Who has no rest, no joy to call her own,
My tasks, my heart, had much the lighter grown."
At Husking Time,"At husking time the tassel fades
To brown above the yellow blades,
    Whose rustling sheath enswathes the corn
    That bursts its chrysalis in scorn
Longer to lie in prison shades.

Among the merry lads and maids
The creaking ox-cart slowly wades
Twixt stalks and stubble, sacked and torn
At husking time.

The prying pilot crow persuades
The flock to join in thieving raids;
The sly racoon with craft inborn
His portion steals; from plenty’s horn
His pouch the saucy chipmunk lades
At husking time."
The Camper,"Night ’neath the northern skies, lone, black, and grim:
Naught but the starlight lies ’twixt heaven, and him.
Of man no need has he, of God, no prayer;
He and his Deity are brothers there. 
Above his bivouac the firs fling down 
Through branches gaunt and black, their needles brown. 
    
Afar some mountain streams, rockbound and fleet
Sing themselves through his dreams in cadence sweet,
The pine trees whispering, the heron’s cry,
The plover’s passing wing, his lullaby. 
And blinking overhead the white stars keep
Watch o’er his hemlock bed—his sinless sleep."
Low Tide at St. Andrews,"(New Brunswick)
The long red flats stretch open to the sky,
Breathing their moisture on the August air.
The seaweeds cling with flesh-like fingers where
The rocks give shelter that the sands deny;
And wrapped in all her summer harmonies
St. Andrews sleeps beside her sleeping seas.
The far-off shores swim blue and indistinct,
Like half-lost memories of some old dream.
The listless waves that catch each sunny gleam
Are idling up the waterways land-linked,
And, yellowing along the harbour's breast,
The light is leaping shoreward from the west.
And naked-footed children, tripping down,
Light with young laughter, daily come at eve
To gather pulse and sea clams and then heave
Their loads, returning laden to the town,
Leaving a strange grey silence when they go,—
The silence of the sands when tides are low."
Lady Lorgnette,"I
Lady Lorgnette, of the lifted lash,
    The curling lip and the dainty nose,
The shell-like ear where the jewels flash,
    The arching brow and the languid pose,
The rare old lace and the subtle scents,
    The slender foot and the fingers frail,—
I may act till the world grows wild and tense,
    But never a flush on your features pale.
The footlights glimmer between us two,—
    You in the box and I on the boards,—
I am only an actor, Madame, to you,
    A mimic king 'mid his mimic lords,
For you are the belle of the smartest set,
    Lady Lorgnette.
II
Little Babette, with your eyes of jet,
     Your midnight hair and your piquant chin,
Your lips whose odors of violet
   Drive men to madness and saints to sin,—
I see you over the footlights' glare
    Down in the pit 'mid the common mob,—
Your throat is burning, and brown, and bare,
    You lean, and listen, and pulse, and throb;
The viols are dreaming between us two,
    And my gilded crown is no make-believe,
I am more than an actor, dear, to you,
    For you called me your king but yesterday eve,
And your heart is my golden coronet,
    Little Babette."
Harvest Time,"Pillowed and hushed on the silent plain,
Wrapped in her mantle of golden grain,
Wearied of pleasuring weeks away,
Summer is lying asleep to-day,—
Where winds come sweet from the wild-rose briers
And the smoke of the far-off prairies fires;
Yellow her hair as the golden rod,
And brown her cheeks as the prairie sod;
Purple her eyes as the mists that dram
At the edge of some laggard sun-drowned stream;
But over their depths the lashes sweep,
For Summer is lying to-day asleep.
The north wind kisses her rosy mouth,
His rival frowns in the far-off south,
And comes caressing her sunburnt cheek,
And Summer awakes for one short week,—
Awakes and gathers her wealth of grain,
Then sleeps and dreams for a year again."
Where Leaps the Ste. Marie,"I
What dream you in the night-time
    When you whisper to the moon?
What say you in the morning?
    What do you sing at noon?
When I hear your voice uplifting,
    Like a breeze through branches sifting,
And your ripples softly drifting
    To the August airs-tune.
II
Lend me your happy laughter,
    Ste. Marie, as you leap;
Your peace that follows after
    Where through the isles you creep.
Give to me your splendid dashing,
    Give your sparkles and your splashing,
Your uphurling waves down crashing,
    Then, your aftermath of sleep."
Canadian Born,"We first saw light in Canada, the land beloved of God;
We are the pulse of Canada, its marrow and its blood:
And we, the men of Canada, can face the world and brag
That we were born in Canada beneath the British flag.
Few of us have the blood of kings, few are courtly birth,
But few are vagabonds or rogues of doubtful name and worth;
And all have one credential that entitles us to brag—
That we were born in Canada beneath the British flag.
We've yet to make our money, we've yet to make our fame,
But we have gold and glory in our clean colonial name;
And every man's a millionaire if only he can brag
That he was born in Canada beneath the British flag.
No title and no coronet is half so proudly worn
As that which we inherited as men Canadian born.
We could no man so noble as the one who makes the brag
That he was born in Canada beneath the British flag.
The Dutch may have their Holland, the Spaniard have his Spain,
The Yankee to the south of us must south of us remain;
For not a man dare lift a hand against the men who brag
That they were born in Canada beneath the British flag."
The Song My Paddle Sings,"West wind, blow from your prairie nest,
Blow from the mountains, blow from the west
The sail is idle, the sailor too;
O! wind of the west, we wait for you.
Blow, blow!
I have wooed you so,
But never a favour you bestow.
You rock your cradle the hills between,
But scorn to notice my white lateen.
I stow the sail, unship the mast:
I wooed you long but my wooing’s past;
My paddle will lull you into rest.
O! drowsy wind of the drowsy west,
Sleep, sleep,
By your mountain steep,
Or down where the prairie grasses sweep!
Now fold in slumber your laggard wings,
For soft is the song my paddle sings.
August is laughing across the sky,
Laughing while paddle, canoe and I,
Drift, drift,
Where the hills uplift
On either side of the current swift.
The river rolls in its rocky bed;
My paddle is plying its way ahead;
Dip, dip,
While the waters flip
In foam as over their breast we slip.
And oh, the river runs swifter now;
The eddies circle about my bow.
Swirl, swirl!
How the ripples curl
In many a dangerous pool awhirl!
And forward far the rapids roar,
Fretting their margin for evermore.
Dash, dash,
With a mighty crash,
They seethe, and boil, and bound, and splash.
Be strong, O paddle! be brave, canoe!
The reckless waves you must plunge into.
Reel, reel.
On your trembling keel,
But never a fear my craft will feel.
We’ve raced the rapid, we’re far ahead!
The river slips through its silent bed.
Sway, sway,
As the bubbles spray
And fall in tinkling tunes away.
And up on the hills against the sky,
A fir tree rocking its lullaby,
Swings, swings,
Its emerald wings,
Swelling the song that my paddle sings."
Man Hesitates but Life Urges,"There is this shifting, endless film
And I have followed it down the valleys
And over the hills,—
Pointing with wavering finger
When it disappeared in purple forest-patches
With its ruffle and wave to the slightest-breathing wind-God.
There is this film
Seen suddenly, far off,
When the sun, walking to his setting,
Turns back for a last look,
And out there on the far, far prairie
A lonely drowsing cabin catches and holds a glint,
For one how endless moment,
In a staring window the fire and song of the martyrs!
There is this film
That has passed to my fingers
And I have trembled,
Afraid to touch.
And in the eyes of one
Who had wanted to give what I had asked
But hesitated—tried—and then
Came with a weary, aged, “Not quite,”
I could but see that single realmless point of time,
All that is sad, and tired, and old—
And endless, shifting film.
And I went again
Down the valleys and over the hills,
Pointing with wavering finger,
Ever reaching to touch, trembling,
Ever fearful to touch."
Golden—Of the Selkirks,"A trail upwinds from Golden; 
It leads to a land God only knows,
To the land of eternal frozen snows,
That trail unknown and olden. 

And they tell a tale that is strange and wild—
Of a lovely and lonely mountain child
That went up the train from Golden. 

A child in the sweet of her womanhood,
Beautiful, tender, grave and good
As the saints in time long olden. 

And the days count not, nor the weeks avail;
For the child that went up the mountain trail
Came never again to Golden. 

And the watchers wept in the midnight gloom, 
Where the cañons yawn and the Selkirks loom, 
For the love that they knew of olden. 

And April dawned, with its suns aflame, 
And the eagles wheeled and the vultures came
And poised o’er the town of Golden. 

God of the white eternal peaks, 
Guard the dead while the vulture seeks!—
God of the days so olden. 

For only God in His greatness knows,
Where the mountain holly above her grows, 
On the trail that leads from Golden. "
The Vagabonds,"What saw you in your flight to-day,
Crows awinging your homeward way?

Went you far in carrion quest,
Crows that worry the sunless west?

Thieves and villains, you shameless things
Black your record as black your wings.

Tell me, birds of the inky hue,
Plunderous rogues—to-day have you
Seen with mischievous, prying eyes
Lands where earlier suns arise?  

Saw you a lazy beck between
Trees that shadow its breast in green,    

Teased by obstinate stones that lie 
Crossing the current tauntingly?

Fields abloom on the farther side       
With purpling clover lying wide—

Saw you there as you circled by,
Vale-environed a cottage lie,

Girt about with emerald bands, 
Nestling down in its meadow lands?

Saw you this on your thieving raids?
Speak—you rascally renegades!

Thieved you also away from me
Olden scenes that I long to see?

If, O! crows, you have flown since morn
Over the place where I was born,           

Forget will I, how black you were     
Since dawn, in feather and character;   

Absolve will I, your vagrant band,         
Ere you enter your slumberland."
My English Letter,"When each white moon, her lantern idly swinging
    Comes out to join the star night-watching band,
Across the grey-green sea, a ship is bringing
    For me a letter, from the Motherland.
Naught would I care to live in quaint old Britain,
    These wilder shores are dearer far to me,
Yet when I read the words that hand has written,
    The parent sod more precious seems to be.
Within that folded note I catch the savour
    Of climes that make the Motherland so fair,
Although I never knew the blessed favour
    That surely lies in breathing English air.
Imagination’s brush before me fleeing,
    Paints English pictures, though my longing eyes
Have never known the blessedness of seeing
    The blue that lines the arch of English skies.
And yet my letter brings the scenes I covet,
    Framed in the salt sea winds, aye more in dreams
I almost see the face that bent above it,
    I almost touch that hand, so near it seems.
Near, for the very grey-green sea that dashes
    ’Round these Canadian coasts, rolls out once more
To Eastward, and the same Atlantic splashes
    Her wild white spray on England’s distant shore.
Near, for the same young moon so idly swinging
    Her threadlike crescent bends the selfsame smile
On that old land from whence a ship is bringing
    My message from the transatlantic Isle.
Thus loves my heart that far old country better,
    Because of those dear words that always come,
With love enfolded in each English letter
    That drifts into my sun-kissed Western home."
The Happy Hunting Grounds,"Into the rose gold westland, its yellow prairies roll,
World of the bison’s freedom, home of the Indian’s soul.
Roll out, O seas! in sunlight bathed,
Your plains wind-tossed, and grass enswathed.
Farther than vision ranges, farther than eagles fly,
Stretches the land of beauty, arches the perfect sky,
Hemm’d through the purple mists afar
By peaks that gleam like star on star.
Fringing the prairie billows, fretting horizon’s line,
Darkly green are slumb’ring wildernesses of pine,
Sleeping until the zephyrs throng
To kiss their silence into song.
Whispers freighted with odour swinging into the air,
Russet needles as censers swing to an altar, where
The angels’ songs are less divine
Than duo sung twixt breeze and pine.
Laughing into the forest, dimples a mountain stream,
Pure as the airs above it, soft as a summer dream,
O! Lethean spring thou’rt only found
Within this ideal hunting ground.
Surely the great Hereafter cannot be more than this,
Surely we’ll see that country after Time’s farewell kiss.
Who would his lovely faith condole?
Who envies not the Red-skin’s soul,
Sailing into the cloud land, sailing into the sun,
Into the crimson portals ajar when life is done?
O! dear dead race, my spirit too
Would fain sail westward unto you."
Re-Voyage,"What of the days when we two dreamed together?
    Days marvellously fair,
As lightsome as a skyward floating feather
    Sailing on summer air—
Summer, summer, that came drifting through
Fate’s hand to me, to you.
What of the days, my dear? I sometimes wonder
    If you too wish this sky
Could be the blue we sailed so softly under,
    In that sun-kissed July;
Sailed in the warm and yellow afternoon,
With hearts in touch and tune.
Have you no longing to re-live the dreaming,
    Adrift in my canoe?
To watch my paddle blade all wet and gleaming
    Cleaving the waters through?
To lie wind-blown and wave-caressed, until
Your restless pulse grows still?
Do you not long to listen to the purling
    Of foam athwart the keel?
To hear the nearing rapids softly swirling
    Among their stones, to feel
The boat’s unsteady tremor as it braves
The wild and snarling waves?
What need of question, what of your replying?
    Oh! well I know that you
Would toss the world away to be but lying
    Again in my canoe,
In listless indolence entranced and lost,
Wave-rocked, and passion tossed.
Ah me! my paddle failed me in the steering
    Across love’s shoreless seas;
All reckless, I had ne’er a thought of fearing
    Such dreary days as these.
When through the self-same rapids we dash by,
My lone canoe and I."
Penserosa,"Soulless is all humanity to me
To-night. My keenest longing is to be
Alone, alone with God’s grey earth that seems
Pulse of my pulse and consort of my dreams.
To-night my soul desires no fellowship,
Or fellow-being; crave I but to slip
Thro’ space on space, till flesh no more can bind,
And I may quit for aye my fellow kind.
Let me but feel athwart my cheek the lash
Of whipping wind, but hear the torrent dash
Adown the mountain steep, ’twere more my choice
Than touch of human hand, than human voice.
Let me but wander on the shore night-stilled,
Drinking its darkness till my soul is filled;
The breathing of the salt sea on my hair,
My outstretched hands but grasping empty air.
Let me but feel the pulse of Nature’s soul
Athrob on mine, let seas and thunders roll
O’er night and me; sands whirl; winds, waters beat;
For God’s grey earth has no cheap counterfeit."
The Birds' Lullaby,"                                  I
Sing to us, cedars; the twilight is creeping
    With shadowy garments, the wilderness through;
All day we have carolled, and now would be sleeping,
    So echo the anthems we warbled to you;
               While we swing, swing,
               And your branches sing,
        And we drowse to your dreamy whispering.
                                  II
Sing to us, cedars; the night-wind is sighing,
    Is wooing, is pleading, to hear you reply;
And here in your arms we are restfully lying,
    And longing to dream to your soft lullaby;
               While we swing, swing,
               And your branches sing.
        And we drowse to your dreamy whispering.
                                  III
Sing to us, cedars; your voice is so lowly,
    Your breathing so fragrant, your branches so strong;
Our little nest-cradles are swaying so slowly,
    While zephyrs are breathing their slumberous song.
               And we swing, swing,
               While your branches sing,
        And we drowse to your dreamy whispering."
At Sunset,"To-night the west o’er-brims with warmest dyes;
Its chalice overflows
With pools of purple colouring the skies,
Aflood with gold and rose;
And some hot soul seems throbbing close to mine,
As sinks the sun within that world of wine.
I seem to hear a bar of music float
And swoon into the west;
My ear can scarcely catch the whispered note,
But something in my breast
Blends with that strain, till both accord in one,
As cloud and colour blend at set of sun.
And twilight comes with grey and restful eyes,
As ashes follow flame.
But O! I heard a voice from those rich skies
Call tenderly my name;
It was as if some priestly fingers stole
In benedictions o’er my lonely soul.
I know not why, but all my being longed
And leapt at that sweet call;
My heart outreached its arms, all passion thronged
And beat against Fate’s wall,
Crying in utter homesickness to be
Near to a heart that loves and leans to me."
Under Canvas,"In Muskoka
Lichens of green and grey on every side;
And green and grey the rocks beneath our feet;
Above our heads the canvas stretching wide;
And over all, enchantment rare and sweet.
Fair Rosseau slumbers in an atmosphere
That kisses her to passionless soft dreams.
O! joy of living we have found thee here,
And life lacks nothing, so complete it seems.
The velvet air, stirred by some elfin wings,
Comes swinging up the waters and then stills
Its voice so low that floating by it sings
Like distant harps among the distant hills.
Across the lake the rugged islands lie.
Fir-crowned and grim; and further in the view
Some shadows seeming swung ’twixt cloud and sky,
Are countless shores, a symphony of blue.
Some northern sorceress, when day is done,
Hovers where cliffs uplift their gaunt grey steeps,
Bewitching to vermilion Rosseau’s sun,
That in a liquid mass of rubies sleeps.
The scent of burning leaves, the camp-fire’s blaze,
The great logs cracking in the brilliant flame,
The groups grotesque, on which the firelight plays,
Are pictures which Muskoka twilights frame.
And Night, star-crested, wanders up the mere
With opiates for idleness to quaff,
And while she ministers, far off I hear
The owl’s uncanny cry, the wild loon’s laugh."
Rainfall,"From out the west, where darkling storm-clouds float,
The ’waking wind pipes soft its rising note.
From out the west, o’erhung with fringes grey,
The wind preludes with sighs its roundelay,
Then blowing, singing, piping, laughing loud,
It scurries on before the grey storm-cloud;
Across the hollow and along the hill
It whips and whirls among the maples, till
With boughs upbent, and green of leaves blown wide,
The silver shines upon their underside.
A gusty freshening of humid air,
With showers laden, and with fragrance rare;
And now a little sprinkle, with a dash
Of great cool drops that fall with sudden splash;
Then over field and hollow, grass and grain,
The loud, crisp whiteness of the nearing rain."
Shadow River,"Muskoka
A stream of tender gladness,
Of filmy sun, and opal tinted skies;
Of warm midsummer air that lightly lies
In mystic rings,
Where softly swings
The music of a thousand wings
That almost tones to sadness.
Midway ’twixt earth and heaven,
A bubble in the pearly air, I seem
To float upon the sapphire floor, a dream
Of clouds of snow,
Above, below,
Drift with my drifting, dim and slow,
As twilight drifts to even.
The little fern-leaf, bending
Upon the brink, its green reflection greets,
And kisses soft the shadow that it meets
With touch so fine,
The border line
The keenest vision can’t define;
So perfect is the blending.
The far, fir trees that cover
The brownish hills with needles green and gold,
The arching elms o’erhead, vinegrown and old,
Repictured are
Beneath me far,
Where not a ripple moves to mar
Shades underneath, or over.
Mine is the undertone;
The beauty, strength, and power of the land
Will never stir or bend at my command;
But all the shade
Is marred or made,
If I but dip my paddle blade;
And it is mine alone.
O! pathless world of seeming!
O! pathless life of mine whose deep ideal
Is more my own than ever was the real.
For others Fame
And Love’s red flame,
And yellow gold: I only claim
The shadows and the dreaming."
Joe,"An etching
A meadow brown; across the yonder edge
A zigzag fence is ambling; here a wedge
Of underbush has cleft its course in twain,
Till where beyond it staggers up again;
The long, grey rails stretch in a broken line
Their ragged length of rough, split forest pine,
And in their zigzag tottering have reeled
In drunken efforts to enclose the field,
Which carries on its breast, September born,
A patch of rustling, yellow, Indian corn.
Beyond its shrivelled tassels, perched upon
The topmost rail, sits Joe, the settler’s son,
A little semi-savage boy of nine.
Now dozing in the warmth of Nature’s wine,
His face the sun has tampered with, and wrought,
By heated kisses, mischief, and has brought
Some vagrant freckles, while from here and there
A few wild locks of vagabond brown hair
Escape the old straw hat the sun looks through,
And blinks to meet his Irish eyes of blue.
Barefooted, innocent of coat or vest,
His grey checked shirt unbuttoned at his chest,
Both hardy hands within their usual nest—
His breeches pockets—so, he waits to rest
His little fingers, somewhat tired and worn,
That all day long were husking Indian corn.
His drowsy lids snap at some trivial sound,
With lazy yawns he slips towards the ground,
Then with an idle whistle lifts his load
And shambles home along the country road
That stretches on, fringed out with stumps and weeds,
And finally unto the backwoods leads,
Where forests wait with giant trunk and bough
The axe of pioneer, the settler’s plough."
Moonset,"Idles the night wind through the dreaming firs,
That waking murmur low,
As some lost melody returning stirs
The love of long ago;
And through the far, cool distance, zephyr fanned.
The moon is sinking into shadow-land.
The troubled night-bird, calling plaintively,
Wanders on restless wing;
The cedars, chanting vespers to the sea,
Await its answering,
That comes in wash of waves along the strand,
The while the moon slips into shadow-land.
O! soft responsive voices of the night
I join your minstrelsy.
And call across the fading silver light
As something calls to me;
I may not all your meaning understand,
But I have touched your soul in shadow-land."
"“And He Said, Fight On”","                     (Tennyson)
Time and its ally, Dark Disarmament,
           Have compassed me about,
Have massed their armies, and on battle bent
           My forces put to rout ;
But though I fight alone, and fall, and die,
           Talk terms of Peace?   Not I.
They war upon my fortress, and their guns
           Are shattering its walls ;
My army plays the cowards’ part, and runs,
           Pierced by a thousand balls ;
They call for my surrender. I reply,
           “Give quarter now?   Not I.”
They’ve shot my flag to ribbons, but in rents
           It floats above the height ;
Their ensign shall not crown my battlements
           While I can stand and fight.
I fling defiance at them as I cry,
           “Capitulate?   Not I.”"
Calgary of the Plains,"Not of the seething cities with their swarming human hives,
Their fetid airs, their reeking streets, their dwarfed and poisoned lives,
Not of the buried yesterdays, but of the days to be,
The glory and the gateway of the yellow West is she.

The Northern Lights dance down her plains with soft and silvery feet,
The sunrise gilds her prairies when the dawn and daylight meet ;
Along her level lands the fitful southern breezes sweep,
And beyond her western windows the sublime old mountains sleep.

The Redman haunts her portals, and the Paleface treads her streets,
The Indian’s stealthy footstep with the course of commerce meets,
And hunters whisper vaguely of the half forgotten tales
Of phantom herds of bison lurking on her midnight trails.

Not hers the lore of olden lands, their laurels and their bays ;
But what are these, compared to one of all her perfect days?
For naught can buy the jewel that upon her forehead lies––
The cloudless sapphire Heaven of her territorial skies."
The Wolf,"Like a grey shadow lurking in the light,
He ventures forth along the edge of night ;
With silent foot he scouts the coulie’s rim
And scents the carrion awaiting him.
His savage eyeballs lurid with a flare
Seen but in unfed beasts which leave their lair
To wrangle with their fellows for a meal
Of bones ill-covered.   Sets he forth to steal,
To search and snarl and forage hungrily ;
A worthless prairie vagabond is he.
Luckless the settler’s heifer which astray
Falls to his fangs and violence a prey ;
Useless her blatant calling when his teeth
Are fast upon her quivering flank––beneath
His fell voracity she falls and dies
With inarticulate and piteous cries,
Unheard, unheeded in the barren waste,
To be devoured with savage greed and haste.
Up the horizon once again he prowls
And far across its desolation howls ;
Sneaking and satisfied his lair he gains
And leaves her bones to bleach upon the plains."
Estrellada,"Despite the hurtling far I go, a same
                                                         loneliness persists its constant hunt——
an old companion, it silvers its way into our still
                                                                        when the house is paused and
each object seems to tilt in mid-plummet,
                                                          each red egg a hatching star in my hair,
each surface of my life a border and singularity:
                                  the migrant heart sliced into petals by guitar string——
born on a cusp, my first cry erupts
                                                                         a strand of throated river rope
that hangs the crossing in a tissue of fog;
                                      in that valley, babies lift to midheaven in sleep, hang
above the deepening cleft, fractaling:
                                                               a concurrent unweaving as I weave,
the text an unraveling ghost-skirt
                                         ever-repeating its leaving and leaving and leaving;

in age, after fate will have made an opus

I will succumb to the hunter in the profound:
                                                 a gallant leap into a copse of pines, the beast
born split, each arrow pierces two beings:
                                                         in wound, the animal turns constellation;
the feminine, obscene."
The Archers,"                                 I
Stripped to the waist, his copper-coloured skin
Red from the smouldering heat of hate within,
Lean as a wolf in winter, fierce of mood––
As all wild things that hunt for foes, or food––
War paint adorning breast and thigh and face,
Armed with the ancient weapons of his race,
A slender ashen bow, deer sinew strung,
And flint-tipped arrow each with poisoned tongue,––
Thus does the Red man stalk to death his foe,
And sighting him strings silently his bow,
Takes his unerring aim, and straight and true
The arrow cuts in flight the forest through,
A flint which never made for mark and missed,
And finds the heart of his antagonist.
Thus has he warred and won since time began,
Thus does the Indian bring to earth his man.
                                   II
Ungarmented, save for a web that lies
In fleecy folds across his impish eyes,
A tiny archer takes his way intent
On mischief, which is his especial bent.
Across his shoulder lies a quiver, filled
With arrows dipped in honey, thrice distilled
From all the roses brides have ever worn
Since that first wedding out of Eden born.
Beneath a cherub face and dimpled smile
This youthful hunter hides a heart of guile ;
His arrows aimed at random fly in quest
Of lodging-place within some blameless breast.
But those he wounds die happily, and so
Blame not young Cupid with his dart and bow :
Thus has he warred and won since time began,
Transporting into Heaven both maid and man."
Day Dawn,"All yesterday the thought of you was resting in my soul.
And when sleep wandered o’er the world that very thought she stole
To fill my dreams with splendour such as stars could not eclipse,
And in the morn I wakened with your name upon my lips.


Awakened, my beloved, to the morning of your eyes,
Your splendid eyes, so full of clouds, wherein a shadow tries
To overcome the flame that melts into the world of grey,
As coming suns dissolve the dark that veils the edge of day.

Cool drifts the air at dawn of day, cool lies the sleeping dew,
But all my heart is burning, for it woke from dreams of you;
And O ! these longing eyes of mine look out and only see
A dying night, a waking day, and calm on all but me.
  So gently creeps the morning through the heavy air,
The dawn grey-garbed and velvet-shod is wandering everywhere
To wake the slumber-laden hours that leave their dreamless rest,
With outspread, laggard wings to court the pillows of the west.
  Up from the earth a moisture steals with odours fresh and soft,
A smell of moss and grasses warm with dew, and far aloft
The stars are growing colourless, while drooping in the west,
A late, wan moon is paling in a sky of amethyst.

The passing of the shadows, as they waft their pinions near,
Has stirred a tender wind within the night-hushed atmosphere,
That in its homeless wanderings sobs in an undertone
An echo to my heart that sobbing calls for you alone.

The night is gone, belovéd, and another day set free,
Another day of hunger for the one I may not see.
What care I for the perfect dawn?  the blue and empty skies?
The night is always mine without the morning of your eyes."
When George was King,"Cards, and swords, and a lady’s love,
That is a tale worth reading,
An insult veiled, a downcast glove,
And rapiers leap unheeding.
       And ’tis O! for the brawl,
       The thrust, the fall,
And the foe at your feet a-bleeding.
  Tales of revel at wayside inns,
The goblets gaily filling,
Braggarts boasting a thousand sins,
Though none can boast a shilling.
       And ’tis O ! for the wine,
       The frothing stein,
And the clamour of cups a-spilling.
  Tales of maidens in rich brocade,
Powder and puff and patches,
Gallants lilting a serenade
Of old-time trolls and catches. 
       And ’tis O ! for the lips
       And the finger tips,
And the kiss that the boldest snatches.
  Tales of buckle and big rosette,
The slender shoe adorning,
Of curtseying through the minuet
With laughter, love, or scorning.
       And ’tis O ! for the shout
       Of the roustabout,
As he hies him home in the morning.
Cards and swords, and a lady’s love,
Give to the tale God-speeding,
War and wassail, and perfumed glove,
And all that’s rare in reading.
       And ’tis O ! for the ways
       Of the olden days,
And a life that was worth the leading."
The Train Dogs,"Out of the night and the north;
   Savage of breed and of bone,
Shaggy and swift comes the yelping band,
Freighters of fur from the voiceless land
   That sleeps in the Arctic zone.
Laden with skins from the north,
   Beaver and bear and raccoon,
Marten and mink from the polar belts,
Otter and ermine and sable pelts––
   The spoils of the hunter’s moon.
Out of the night and the north,
   Sinewy, fearless and fleet,
Urging the pack through the pathless snow,
The Indian driver, calling low,
   Follows with moccasined feet.
Ships of the night and the north,
   Freighters on prairies and plains,
Carrying cargoes from field and flood
They scent the trail through their wild red blood,
   The wolfish blood in their veins."
The Homing Bee,"You are belted with gold, little brother of mine,
      Yellow gold, like the sun
That spills in the west, as a chalice of wine
      When feasting is done.
You are gossamer-winged, little brother of mine,
      Tissue winged, like the mist
That broods where the marshes melt into a line
      Of vapour sun-kissed.
You are laden with sweets, little brother of mine,
      Flower sweets, like the touch
Of hands we have longed for, of arms that entwine,
      Of lips that love much.
You are better than I, little brother of mine,
      Than I, human-souled,
For you bring from the blossoms and red summer shine,
      For others, your gold."
The Lifting of the Mist,"All the long day the vapours played
    At blindfold in the city streets,
Their elfin fingers caught and stayed
    The sunbeams, as they would their sheets
Into a filmy barricade
    ’Twixt earth and where the sunlight beats.
A vagrant band of mischiefs these,
    With wings of grey and cobweb gown;
They live along the edge of seas,
    And creeping out on foot of down,
They chase and frolic, frisk and tease
    At blind-man’s buff with all the town.
And when at eventide the sun
    Breaks with a glory through their grey,
The vapour-fairies, one by one,
Outspread their wings and float away
In clouds of colouring, that run
    Wine-like along the rim of day.
Athwart the beauty and the breast
    Of purpling airs they twirl and twist,
Then float away to some far rest,
    Leaving the skies all colour-kiss’t––
A glorious and a golden West
    That greets the Lifting of the Mist."
Canada,"(Acrostic)
Crown of her, young Vancouver; crest of her, old Quebec;
Atlantic and far Pacific sweeping her, keel to deck.
North of her, ice and arctics; southward a rival’s stealth;
Aloft, her Empire’s pennant; below, her nation’s wealth.
Daughter of men and markets, bearing within her hold,
Appraised at highest value, cargoes of grain and gold."
In English for Clarity,"The remnants I no longer believe the words that float inside without the pretension of release Father your loneliness this empty church is my answer my mother All that is destroyed is my love don’t ask don’t repeat tell me I treasure the copies with original envy with majesty reserved for a tourist this way when I say help you cannot pretend to misunderstand you cannot turn to the other two in a different language and respond simply with How still you feel How closely this resembles love. Father even violence can be redeemed this way. When enclosed in this much solitude. In this temperature and Mother it has much to do with age and never being mine.

 "
The Trail to Lillooet,"Sob of fall, and song of forest, come you here on haunting quest,
Calling through the seas and silence, from God’s country of the west.
Where the mountain pass is narrow, and the torrent white and strong,
Down its rocky-throated cañon, sings its golden-throated song.
You are singing there together through the God-begotten nights,
And the leaning stars are listening above the distant heights
That lift like points of opal in the crescent coronet
About whose golden setting sweeps the trail to Lillooet.
Trail that winds and trail that wanders, like a cobweb hanging high,
Just a hazy thread outlining mid-way of the stream and sky,
Where the Fraser River cañon yawns its pathway to the sea,
But half the world has shouldered up between its song and me.
Here, the placid English August, and the sea-encircled miles,
There––God’s copper-coloured sunshine beating through the lonely aisles
Where the waterfalls and forest voice for ever their duet,
And call across the cañon on the trail to Lillooet."
The Cattle Country,"Up the dusk-enfolded prairie,
   Foot-falls, soft and sly,
Velvet cushioned, wild and wary,
   Then––the coyote’s cry.
Rush of hoofs, and roar and rattle,
   Beasts of blood and breed,
Twenty thousand frightened cattle,
   Then––the wild stampede.
Pliant lasso circling wider
   In the frenzied flight––
Loping horse and cursing rider,
   Plunging through the night.
Rim of dawn the darkness losing
   Trail of blackened soil;
Perfume of the sage brush oozing
   On the air like oil.
Foothills to the Rockies lifting
   Brown, and blue, and green,
Warm Alberta sunlight drifting
   Over leagues between.
That’s the country of the ranges,
   Plain and prairie land,
And the God who never changes
   Holds it in His hand."
"Lines Written at Castle Island, Lake Superior","translated from the Anishinaabemowin
Here in my native inland sea
From pain and sickness would I flee
And from its shores and island bright
Gather a store of sweet delight.
Lone island of the saltless sea!
How wide, how sweet, how fresh and free
How all transporting—is the view
Of rocks and skies and waters blue
Uniting, as a song’s sweet strains
To tell, here nature only reigns.
Ah, nature! here forever sway
Far from the haunts of men away
For here, there are no sordid fears,
No crimes, no misery, no tears
No pride of wealth; the heart to fill,
No laws to treat my people ill."
The Indian Corn Planter,"He needs must leave the trapping and the chase,
   For mating game his arrows ne’er despoil,
And from the hunter’s heaven turn his face,
   To wring some promise from the dormant soil.
He needs must leave the lodge that wintered him,
   The enervating fires, the blanket bed––
The women’s dulcet voices, for the grim
   Realities of laboring for bread.
So goes he forth beneath the planter’s moon
   With sack of seed that pledges large increase,
His simple pagan faith knows night and noon,
   Heat, cold, seedtime and harvest shall not cease.
And yielding to his needs, this honest sod,
   Brown as the hand that tills it, moist with rain,
Teeming with ripe fulfillment, true as God,
   With fostering richness, mothers every grain."

Ghazal for a First Lover,"When I first took her or she took me, sanded
and bagged me, loosened up my eyes
Sun was our planet, broken into arrows, heat along
our arms, burned, burnt, dissolving into ay’s
Mouthed weather, marsh of sheets, splintered skin
where now she buried salt, my gorgeous demise
I tried not to name what came for me, yet: elbow, kneecap,
chin hair, waves of smell grafted to cupping hands, overflowing eyes
Grew me longer than the length of me, myself gone reaching,
reaping—how, silly me, I thought I’d ever used before my eyes."
Evening,"From out my open window, I can see
The rolling waves, as fierce and restlessly,
They dash against the long, long stretch of shore,
And in the distance, I can dimly trace,
Some out-bound vessel having left her place
Of Harbor, to return perhaps no more.
Within my mind there dwells this lingering thought,
How oft from ill the greatest good is wrought,
Perhaps some shattered wreck along the strand,
Will help to make the fire burn more bright,
And for some weary traveller to-night,
’Twill serve the purpose of a guiding hand.
Ah yes, and thus it is with these our lives,
Some poor misshapen remnant still survives,
Of what was once a fair and beauteous form,
And yet some dwelling may be made more bright,
Some one afar may catch a gleam of light,
After the fury of the blighting storm."
Morning,"Bright glows the morn, I pace the shining sands,
And watch the children, as with eager hands
They gather driftwood for the evening fire.
Their merry laughter, ringing loud and clear,
Resounds like sweetest music to my ear,
As swift they toil, each with the same desire.
And now their task completed, they depart,
Each one with beaming face and happy heart,
They too, will watch the driftwood fire to-night,
And knowing this, they hasten glad and gay,
With willing feet, along the homeward way,
Their precious burdens bearing with delight.
I watch these little children of the poor,
Till they have reached each lowly dwelling’s door,
And then, I too my footsteps homeward turn;
I fancy what a joyous sight ’twill be,
To see the children sitting in their glee,
Close by the fire and laugh to see it burn."

Coyote grows feathers over keel bone,
thrusting, as if to buoy gently—        blown

Truth Is Mortal,"Lines suggested by the tenor of a friendly interview between the author and the editor of the Chieftain in reference to the capture and incarceration of Crazy Snake, the Muskogee patriot.
“Truth crushed to earth will rise again,”
   ’Tis sometimes said. False! When it dies,
Like a tall tree felled on the plain,
   It never, never more, can rise.
Dead beauty’s buried out of sight;
   ’Tis gone beyond the eternal wave;
Another springs up into light,
   But not the one that’s in the grave.
I saw a ship once leave the shore;
   Its name was “Truth;” and on its board
It bore a thousand souls or more:
   Beneath its keel the ocean roared.
That ship went down with all its crew.
   True: other ships as proud as she,
Well built, and strong, and wholly new,
   Still ride upon that self-same sea.
But “Truth,” and all on her embarked
   Are lost in an eternal sleep,
(The fatal place itself unmarked)
   Far down in the abysmal deep.
Let fleeing Aguinaldo speak;
   And Oc̅eola from his cell;
And Sitting Bull, and Crazy Snake;
   Their story of experience tell.
There is no truth in all the earth
   But there’s a Calvary and a Cross;
We scarce have time to hail its birth,
   Ere we are called to mark its loss.
The truth that lives and laugh’s a sneak,
   That crouching licks the hand of power,
While that that’s worth the name is weak,
   And under foot dies every hour."
Waste Land,"Briar and fennel and chincapin,
    And rue and ragweed everywhere;
The field seemed sick as a soul with sin,
    Or dead of an old despair,
    Born of an ancient care.
The cricket’s cry and the locust’s whirr,
    And the note of a bird’s distress,
With the rasping sound of the grasshopper,
    Clung to the loneliness
    Like burrs to a trailing dress.
So sad the field, so waste the ground,
     So curst with an old despair,
A woodchuck’s burrow, a blind mole’s mound
     And a chipmunk’s stony lair,
     Seemed more than it could bear.
So lonely, too, so more than sad,
    So droning-lone with bees —
I wondered what more could Nature add
    To the sum of its miseries  .   .   .
    And then—I saw the trees. 
Skeletons gaunt that gnarled the place,
    Twisted and torn they rose—
The tortured bones of a perished race
    Of monsters no mortal knows,
    They started the mind’s repose.
And a man stood there, as still as moss,
    A lichen form that stared;
With an old blind hound that, at a loss,
    Forever around him fared
    With a snarling fang half bared.
I looked at the man; I saw him plain;
    Like a dead weed, gray and wan
Or a breath of dust.   I looked again—
    And man and dog were gone,
    Like wisps of the graying dawn.   .   .   .
Were they a part of the grim death there—
    Ragweed, fennel, and rue?
Or forms of the mind, an old despair,
    That there into semblance grew
    Out of the grief I knew?

Iris of Life,"Like tiny drops of crystal rain,
       In every life the moments fall,
To wear away with silent beat,
       The shell of selfishness o’er all.
And every act, not one too small,
       That leaps from out the heart’s pure glow,
Like ray of gold sends forth a light,
       While moments into seasons flow.
Athwart the dome, Eternity,
       To Iris grown resplendent, fly
Bright gleams from every noble deed,
       Till colors with each other vie.
’Tis glimpses of this grand rainbow,
       Where moments with good deeds unite,
That gladden many weary hearts,
       Inspiring them to seek more Light."

Thank God for Hard Feelings,"The life of a garment worker in midtown Manhattan.
She worked as seamstress in the sweatshops of New York City.
Whose mother is not the love of their life?
She pushed her lunch on co-workers
from Russia, Togo, Haiti, Dominican Republic.
They disliked the sugar fried anchovies.
They saw the nimbus on each fish
and politely or raucously declined. The cavernous
spaces of her mind. Having studied graphic design
at Duksung Women’s College, Dobong-gu, Seoul,
what else was she going to do but write a novel.
Staring at sea windows, she scrawled and chalked
in her head. Drong of eternal absence. An expert
on the social history of the Staten Island Ferry,
she confided in me the act of crying was a privilege.
What type of person leaves a near full can of
coconut water on the bleachers? You have to be
happy in order to weep, or sob. I can teach you,
she said to me. If you can hold a pencil, I can teach you
how to draw. But I’ve known people who have
no hands. Who have no fingers."
Inversion,"for Major and Didi Jackson
There’s no suffering among dandelions,
in the way the corral gate swings open
or how the gears stay up late
to keep the wrists of the dead company.
And there’s no suffering in silt or the word marsh
or in the quadratic equation, which scurries
beneath the floorboards of my thought
like a mouse drunk on plum wine.
There’s no suffering in the steam backlit
and seared into the world at an early hour
with the horse as its guide. And there’s no suffering
in lag bolts or u-joints, nor in the sexed-up shadows
of grain elevators. There’s no suffering
in the verb itself—to suffer—which, in my kin’s tongue
means charged by the sight of an owl,
let loose from a barbed hook, returned
to the reservoir of the mind.
Today, I’m a chemical emulsion
that burns light onto paper, a three-cent stamp
honoring a woman whose name
is cloth spread throughout a meadow,
mortar setting up in a constant breeze.
The mountain air takes a handful of memories
from my chest, spreads them before me
like pewter figurines until I feel
like a tube of lipstick with an erotic name
or the long vowels in a wave’s trough,
all hum and echo. Friend, I’m both
a keyhole in a star and the key chained
to a young boy’s neck. I’m the thistle and its bloom,
father rack and pinion son, gravel and its dust.
And here, before you now, I’m on a measure
of consonants gnawing the green roots
from a blinded moon, where I say to hell with kings
and jeweled blood, for in this kingdom
suffering shall be, but never be invented."

The Battle-Field,"Once this soft turf, this rivulet’s sands,
   Were trampled by a hurrying crowd,
And fiery hearts and armed hands
   Encountered in the battle cloud.

Ah! I never shall the land forget
   How gushed the life-blood of her brave—
Gushed, warm with hope and courage yet,
   Upon the soil they fought to save.

Now all is calm, and fresh, and still,
   Alone the chirp of flitting bird,
And talk of children on the hill,
   And bell of wandering kine are heard.

No solemn host goes trailing by
   The black-mouthed gun and staggering wain;
Men start not at the battle-cry,
   Oh, be it never heard again!

Soon rested those who fought; but thou
   Who minglest in the harder strife
For truths which men receive not now
   Thy warfare only ends with life.

A friendless warfare! lingering long
   Through weary day and weary year.
A wild and many-weaponed throng
   Hang on thy front, and flank, and rear.

Yet nerve thy spirit to the proof,
   And blench not at thy chosen lot.
The timid good may stand aloof,
   The sage may frown—yet faint thou not.

Nor heed the shaft too surely cast,
   The foul and hissing bolt of scorn;
For with thy side shall dwell, at last,
   The victory of endurance born.

Truth, crushed to earth, shall rise again;
   The eternal years of God are hers;
But Error, wounded, writhes with pain,
   And dies among his worshippers.

Yea, though thou lie upon the dust,
   When they who helped thee flee in fear,
Die full of hope and manly trust,
   Like those who fell in battle here.

Another hand thy sword shall wield,
   Another hand the standard wave,
Till from the trumpet’s mouth is pealed
   The blast of triumph o’er thy grave."
Porphyria’s Lover,"THE rain set early in to-night,
     The sullen wind was soon awake,
It tore the elm-tops down for spite,
     And did its worst to vex the lake:
     I listened with heart fit to break.
When glided in Porphyria; straight
     She shut the cold out and the storm,
And kneeled and made the cheerless grate
     Blaze up, and all the cottage warm;
     Which done, she rose, and from her form
Withdrew the dripping cloak and shawl,
     And laid her soiled gloves by, untied
Her hat and let the damp hair fall,
     And, last, she sat down by my side
     And called me. When no voice replied,
She put my arm about her waist,
     And made her smooth white shoulder bare,
And all her yellow hair displaced,
     And, stooping, made my cheek lie there,
     And spread, o’er all, her yellow hair,
Murmuring how she loved – she
     Too weak, for all her heart’s endeavor,
To set its struggling passion free
     From pride, and vainer ties dissever,
     And give herself to me for ever.
But passion sometimes would prevail,
     Nor could to-night’s gay feast restrain
A sudden thought of one so pale
     For love of her, and all in vain:
     So, she was come through wind and rain.
Be sure I looked up at her eyes
     Happy and proud; at last I knew
Porphyria worshipped me; surprise
     Made my heart swell, and still it grew
     While I debated what to do.
That moment she was mine, mine, fair,
     Perfectly pure and good: I found
A thing to do, and all her hair
     In one long yellow string I wound
     Three times her little throat around,
And strangled her. No pain felt she;
     I am quite sure she felt no pain.
As a shut bud that holds a bee,
     I warily oped her lids: again
     Laughed the blue eyes without a strain.
And I untightened next the tress
     About her neck; her cheek once more
Blushed bright beneath my burning kiss:
     I propped her head up as before,
     Only, this time my should bore
Her head, which droops upon it still:
     The smiling rosy little head,
So glad it has its utmost will,
     That all it scorned at once is fled,
     And I, its love, am gained instead!
Porphyria’s love: she guessed not how
     Her darling one wish would be heard.
And thus we sit together now,
     And all night long we have not stirred,
     And yet God has not said a word!"
I Was a Hero Once,"A dormant satellite in a room
with children, bouncing
atoms off the walls.
They are faceless, sweaty
and every storm-based verb.
I corral them before the television––
an antique microwave cooking
colorless cartoons.
As the constellation of them settle,
I move to the next room and see it.
The ceramic planter which held
a tittering ficus
had been kicked into slices.
This sight weakens me
into obscene prayers while
pulling shards from the black
pudding soil as if harvesting tombstones.
I caress the threads of roots,
squiggling in my fingers,
like the hand of a dying grandparent––
my heart pours itself empty
through disbelieving eyes.
And to think I was a hero once.
I followed a pack of thieves
who hid in a darkness unnamed by science,
yet I could still see them
              and felt sorry for them
as I levitated above the yard.
The stitching in my palms itched
emitting ophidian beams of flame
igniting every wet, incombustible
thing, synthesizing everything else
to greasy ash.
                         I could not be defeated.
I was so alone.
                         And look at me now:
Stacking broken pottery,
Pawing through soil as hissing
tears drop like dead moths.
Only a _________ can be bested
and crushed from within by indifferent children."

We’d been speaking of doctors and mistakes
when his face shifted gears,
he landed his fork like tapping a baton.
This is how boys are. Show
and prove.           Tale of the tape.
People are terrified by skin
              not meeting their expectations.
For years, white women were forbidden
from showing their navels on TV.
The networks were alarmed
                                   over what they symbolized,
                                   how they seemed to prove something,
              root us together.

The Dirge,"     Old winter was gone 
In his weakness back to the mountains hoar, 
     And the spring came down
From the planet that hovers upon the shore
     Where the sea of sunlight encroaches 
On the limits of wintry night;—
 If the land, and the air, and the sea, 
     Rejoice not when spring approaches, 
  We did not rejoice in thee, 
         Ginevra! 

She is still, she is cold
     On the bridal couch, 
One step to the white deathbed, 
   And one to the bier, 
And one to the charnel—and one, oh where? 
    The dark arrow fled
    In the noon. 

Ere the sun through heaven once has rolled, 
The rats in her heart
Will have made their nest, 
And the worms be alive in her golden hair, 
While the Spirit that guides the sun, 
Sits throned in his flaming chair,
   She shall sleep. "

filaments stand in ceremony
to your song of color
insects decide to walk the labyrinth
of your perfumed path
are you tickled by these
cellular inspectors
sipping your sweet wine of particulates
would you have preferred to be a robin
burdened with the sky’s
most unique song
do you wish you were the moon
a whole planet of petals
with an atmosphere of cologne
a dolphin bathing in the coral medicines
of an oceanic garden?
you itch
when you are closed
                          shy & anxious
unconcerned with weather
              death or dementia
you are the earth’s soldier of love,
                                    desire
yet––what do you know of it?"
The Sleeper,"At midnight, in the month of June, 
I stand beneath the mystic moon. 
An opiate vapour, dewy, dim, 
Exhales from out her golden rim,
And, softly dripping, drop by drop, 
Upon the quiet mountain top, 
Steals drowsily and musically
Into the universal valley. 
The rosemary nods upon the grave;
The lily lolls upon the wave;
Wrapping the fog about its breast,
The ruin moulders into rest; 
Looking like Lethe, see! the lake
A conscious slumber seems to take, 
And would not, for the world, awake. 
All Beauty sleeps!—and lo! where lies
(Her casment open to the skies)
Irene, with her Destinles! 
Oh, lady bright! can it be right—
This window open to the night?
The wanton airs, from the tree-top,
Laughingly through the lattice drop—
The bodiless airs, a wizard rout,
Flit through thy chamber in and out,
And wave the curtain canopy
So fitfully—so fearfully—
Above the closed and fringéd lid
’Neath which thy slumb’ring soul lies hid,
That, o’er the floor and down the wall,
Like ghosts the shadows rise and fall!
Oh, lady dear, hast thou no fear?
Why and what art thou dreaming here?
Sure thou art come o’er far-off seas,
A wonder to these garden trees!
Strange is thy pallor! strange thy dress!
Strange, above all, thy length of tress,
And this all solemn silentness!
The lady sleeps! Oh, may her sleep,
Which is enduring, so be deep!
Heaven have her in its sacred keep!
This chamber changed for one more holy,
This bed for one more melancholy,
I pray to God that she may lie
Forever with unopened eye,
While the pale sheeted ghosts go by!
My love, she sleeps! Oh, may her sleep,
As it is lasting, so be deep!
Soft may the worms about her creep!
Far in the forest, dim and old,
For her may some tall vault unfold—
Some vault that oft hath flung its black
And wingéd pannels fluttering back,
Triumphant, o’er the crested palls
Of her grand family funerals—
Some sepulchre, remote, alone,
Against whose portals she hath thrown,
In childhood, many an idle stone—
Some tomb from out whose sounding door
She ne’er shall force an echo more,
Thrilling to think, poor child of sin!
It was the dead who groaned within."
Love Is Easier the Headless Way,"Love is easier the headless way
what good is desire in a world
where there is only a thriving darkness
Your mouth is a gate
opening to any place away from here––
the crumbling mansion of my nothing heart
With this form-fitting cloth
                                      I do wed
Let us spill into one another
like waves of agitated milk
Placing our thoughts elsewhere
               onto unavailable others
while our useless arms
disappear into what frames us:
bench / bed / brothel of the mind
Everywhere we turn
winter remains unfinished
You don’t trust your mouth
and I don’t trust anyone
who says they love me
What are we willing to emotionally
barter for when all we have
is the simple meat of ourselves
And who can say what color the world
was before the earth’s canvas
began flowering paint.
                                           I have this recurring dream
where we live nameless as mushrooms
in the shadow of primeval birds––
birds who eluded ornithologists
and didn’t want the press
But who agreed to soar forever
without landing
and seed the earth with minerals of light.
I awake, usually, in a choking grief.
How we’ve agreed to love one another
without ever opening our eyes."
The Night is Darkening Round Me,"The night is darkening round me
The wild winds coldly blow
But a tyrant spell has bound me 
And I cannot cannot go

The giant trees are bending 
Their bare boughs weighed with snow 
And the storm is fast descending

Clouds beyond clouds above me 
Wastes beyond wastes below 
But nothing drear can move me 
I will not cannot go "

    off Plot Road
in March thaw
I stop in a stand
of red pines
to listen to tilt
as each trunk
follows wind
in its crown
& sounds grain
against grain
straining noise
as intimate
as that of a joint
aching into age
I can see
outside the pines
the weave of things
crows in a lone oak
concatenating
the ecotone
where meadow
meets forest
white folks
clear cut
not long ago
to farm hay
on open land
later reclaimed
by the succession
of trees mostly
the mechanism
of small animals
& hard weather
on Clay Hill
above the valley
village I left
on foot to find
up Cemetery
Road the old
graves buried
in terraced drifts
headstones in rows
visible over snow
totally grayscale
except for sumac
at cemetery’s edge
upright red
cones torching
holes in the visual
field the way
the fresh kill
I found en route
melted the snow
its startled predator
had dropped it in
blood & feathers
a deep wet nest
the day looked
less dense
without leaves
but winter felt
thicker with
the effort of getting
there & I went
on past graves
holding settlers
& Civil War vets
until the pines
seemed to charm
me out of myself
to stop & stand
& think touching
their live hard sides
of Plato’s vision
the human not
an earthly but
a heavenly plant
the soul housed
in the head
threaded down
out of abstract
heaven to live
in the physical
soil the human
rooted in the two
worlds I look
up to see
each trunk
unsettled by wind
torque makes
groan & crowns
twist against
roots in earth
the way I might
fight an idea
that seizes me
with its weather
& I wonder
what it sounds like
the loblolly
bioengineered

its genes spliced
with Monterey pine
mouse ear cress

reaching toward it

warm day
filled the walk
uphill with thaw
falling loud
from eaves & limbs
& rills thrilled
the angled road

of Thoreau who wrote

& I am prepared
to expect wonders
& I think
of transgenic pollen
germinating
after it travels
hundreds of miles
& how farmers
can’t contain
cross-pollination
between spliced

& how hybrid trees
will intertwine
with the hungers
of the red squirrel

bright against

an acorn between
its orange teeth
& I do not move
further toward
the laboratory

in genes chosen
& fused to produce

to seed a kind
of life not yet

I want to believe
wind will make
new wood grain
groan & yellow
curtains of pollen
will billow after
mud season
finishes off
a long winter
I want to believe
birds will drop
coniferous seeds
in fields cleared
of old red oak
& rodents will store
hoards of acorns
that will root
& rise after fires
clear out dry pines
& all will continue
the succession
of trees in a world
in which we’ll touch
others invented
for a profit made
ontological
the very genome
grafted to capital
I stand inside
the charm the stand
makes out of wind
the stand someone
planted & didn’t
harm or harvest
& so has persisted
beyond human
use for so long
the base of each
trunk is ringed
thick with moss
watered by runoff
washing nutrients
down yards of bark
years of touch
create this color
collaring the pines
with a green brighter
than their needles
material relation
the ensoiled soul
we’re rooted in
the way heaven
derives itself
from words for sky
& words for stone
the way a birch
has infiltrated
the symmetrical
stand at an angle
weighted by snow
its rough trunk
bent & its bark
sloughing off
botched swaths
around lichen
in wide ruptures
working upward
a sort of saffron

of fox piss in snow"
Sitting River Meditation,"(Johnson, VT)
  At night the river,
            frozen over, fits
its bed like a key
            its lock. The current
keeps turning but
            the surface won’t
open. I can
            hear ice click, shift,
its crystalline pins
            caught. Twenty miles south
of Lake Eden,
            its origin,
the Gihon’s near its end.
            After the old red mill,
before it enters
            the Lamoille, it falls
flat, a closed
            door. Wrong key
in the wrong lock,
            I like to put
my mind where two worlds
            meet & agree to
disagree. The teachers
            say : take up the water,
make it your body
            & mind, make it thought.
But I think I
            must think the way
elements make
            temporary
arrangements
            with weather :
hydrogen locked
            to oxygen,
each strong molecule
            expands, a lattice
of tetrahedrons.
            All their new shapes make
ephemeral color
            the way what light there is
at midnight heightens
            ice, brighter briefly
than snow. & toward
            that whiteness my mind
pushes outward from
            the interior
where olivine water
            washes over gravel
& sand. Thought
            exerts drag
against the icy
            underside, & I
feel a border
            experience
can’t cross over
            into knowledge
the way in front
            of paradox
my mind stops :
            for five years
my ill body killed me
            while it kept me alive.
On the bank bare
            brambles catch snow
weighted with rain
            that falls straight down,
hissing as it hits
            the ice. Who am I
now. Above : mountains.
            Below : the river.
Both moving & still,
            inaccessible
& everywhere, being
            is & keeps to itself,
hidden in emblems
            of the outward, seeds
extracted from bracts
            of a dry pine cone.
The spring equinox
            is near : rain coaxes
the icy lattices
            to relax into lapse,
little cracks
            mid-river.
It’s so quiet
            I hardly feel
desire. But its soft force
            flenses the strongest water
from thaw : there, at
            the thinnest brink,
kinesis that
            resists stillness,
thinking on thinking,
            the current pulses."
Quakinggrass ( Briza Maxima ),"I’ve cut from summer—
       as if a swatch were possible—
       not collage exactly—
  Gnats hovered above dirt
       path between chaparral
       (pretty word—Spanish—“evergreen oak”)—
  I envy the photo its frame—
       what I meant to say—
       to walk through gnats
  Curtained between trees
       smelled “skunky”
       (his word)—
  I followed him—
       no one had said “love” yet—
       high bluff cliffing the Pacific—
  Spine of shadow
       we walked—
       temperate in the sense
  Air felt without temperature—
       “riparian” gleaned from signage
       (prettier even—rīpa—“bank”)—
  Because the near river entered ocean
       I’ve cut from it—
       the way the photographer knows what lies
  Beyond the frame—
       context is terrible weight—
       to describe the water’s texture of
  Gestures would never end—
       an inch of surface
       surfeit sense (“a detail overwhelms
  Entirety,” writes Barthes)—
        his storied thigh
        scarred just so
  (Coin-sized pock marking
        loin)
        & tilted toward me—
  Each image cropped but the frame—
        a lifetime—
        a coastline—
  What is meant by context : to pose
        ruins the shot with intention—
        eye the I, he the camera—
  Big Sur River a lagoon where it enters ocean—
        & there a willow grove—
        we waded out, we saw tide
  Lift river & slip in—
        eddies edging the upriver bend—
        the privacy of being entered is
  What I felt privy to—
        salt driving tide under- & upriver both—
        it came to us as counter-current—
  Water swelled within itself—
        more forceful than the river
        entering itself
  was pressure against my skin—
        as when I held his cock & his body
        bodied forth there—
  Tender force
        rivering—
        his need to enter me—
  An image pierced by the ear—
        a raptor over
        coastal fields—
  Santa Lucia Mountains behind us—
        what is “lyric”—
        hawk, we thought—
  (Raptus from rapere, “seize” or “rape”)—
        its passing shadow triggered
        chill as it touched us—
  Crow-sized, a harsh loud scream—

Ferruginous—
  I imagined its passage over the field
            a ring of blackened grass—
            rust-colored tail broad, fanned, tipped with white—
  A “sting, speck, cut” or “little hole” in the image—
            the attention taxonomy requires
            amounts to a species of singing—
  A dark leading inner edge on the underwing—
            what is “lyric”—
            “subversive when pensive, when it thinks”—
  (What he meant by frame)—
            the image came to him as the desire to have
            photographed the “right” thing—
  He the I, eye the camera—
            what we saw as “beauty” meant only
            evening—
  Swallows looped & dived to drink—
            “I should dump your sorry ass in the water,” he said—
            to relate that which is spoken of
  To the spatial & temporal context of the utterance—
            “Why do I always hold back?”—
            without it the image can’t live—
  A list of possible swallows—
            Tree, Bank, Cliff, Barn, Violet-green, Rough-winged—
            the migratory flyway’s dwindling returns—
  Without a frame the image
            a lens of air—

a pillow thrown against a mirror—

Lines Written During My Second Pandemic,"after Franca Mancinelli
All water flows toward loneliness.
Loneliness is a black eye, a gleaming pit.
We have yet to split loneliness like an atom.
Loneliness arrives on a leash of scorpions.
In my skull, loneliness opens like a parachute.
It’s illegal to chain loneliness to a fence.
Flickers tunnel through loneliness to build nests.
I sprinkle a spoon of sugar over loneliness.
In some languages, loneliness is imperfect.
Antlers crown the bald head of loneliness.
Like rough trade, loneliness won’t kiss you.
Loneliness is crouched in a tree, afraid of dirt.
In the dark, loneliness ripens too quickly.
Beneath the roof of loneliness, my blood drifts."
The Listeners,"‘Is there anybody there?’ said the Traveller,
   Knocking on the moonlit door;
And his horse in the silence champed the grasses
   Of the forest’s ferny floor:
And a bird flew up out of the turret,
   Above the Traveller’s head:
And he smote upon the door again a second time;
   ‘Is there anybody there?’ he said.
But no one descended to the Traveller;
   No head from the leaf-fringed sill
Leaned over and looked into his grey eyes,
   Where he stood perplexed and still.
But only a host of phantom listeners
   That dwelt in the lone house then
Stood listening in the quiet of the moonlight
   To that voice from the world of men:
Stood thronging the faint moonbeams on the dark stair,
   That goes down to the empty hall,
Hearkening in an air stirred and shaken
   By the lonely Traveller’s call.
And he felt in his heart their strangeness,
   Their stillness answering his cry,
While his horse moved, cropping the dark turf,
   ’Neath the starred and leafy sky;
For he suddenly smote on the door, even
   Louder, and lifted his head:—
‘Tell them I came, and no one answered,
   That I kept my word,’ he said.
Never the least stir made the listeners,
   Though every word he spake
Fell echoing through the shadowiness of the still house
   From the one man left awake:
Ay, they heard his foot upon the stirrup,
   And the sound of iron on stone,
And how the silence surged softly backward,
   When the plunging hoofs were gone."
Californian (“You want to go back”),"You want to go back
where grief was perfect weather...
A long time
rain trussed the perspectives
with rope and silver. In the grove,
in the eucalyptus,
shadow bound
in shapeless sheaves : a sfumato of indigo
and graphite leaving the air
beneath the leaves a stain, as of mineral
and berries, a smear of menthol.
No birds ever—
or it seems so now—
in the forest. No sound
but a soft mathematics in the branches,
rain adding rain
to rain. No growth—
each tree’s dermis : dark blown glass and a breath
kept inside. And fastened
with twists of thin wire
to the branches, the leaves’ useless
ruined currency;
it glisters :
a mint of flattened nickels. It seems
you have come back—but
the money of your elegies is no good here,
listen : it isn’t your pennies any longer
hold his eyes closed."
Californian (“It began like this”),"It began like this : a radio
midday, heat—remember?—a shriek
on the highway, and in the yard
Steller’s jays chafing over haggle, nag, their claims
a lyric tableau—pretty for the eye—how
sun for months stuck aureoles
of chrome around everything, even
your poems, omens
so no other disaster would happen.
But that there was dust—
it had not been so before in June,
grass dead at edges
where a dirt spread had begun, feral
cats interring piss into nasturtiums.
His death had become
the dropped side of a song, melody
undone by damage
exactly the feel of teeth entering
an apple’s bruise. The trellis kept
the jasmine rapt
as it collapsed in its own odor; so ardor also
trained the spine
of your weeping into a mind,
confluence of fumes and confusion. Over sills,
jambs, silt sent collusion : thistle, burr, mouse
turds, urine’s lingering funk in rooms
where to write was a widow
alone with the last broom she’d bought. Heat,
with its missing finger
and nine filed nails, tuned all afternoon
its blue note : horizon a slack string tautening
against asphalt, whose sound
was drought, marsh departed
before August began, black-outs rolled
house to house, how perfect the fraud and emergencies.
So there were two songs
sung in counterpoint
to jays, argument about belonging to
a place,—remember—
prey and prayer, one struck
the other beneath the lyric image, playing flint
to tinder until on the radio
eastern hills caught fire : extremis,
excelsis, that is
how summer, all veils
and exhalations, courted the hills. How
already the church was burning
when your soul went out to meet him, to marry
his new weather—"
Emerson Susquehanna (iii. then may God fire...with...presence.”),"And you can never catch it
                                                            nor make it still
  and so it is like thought in this
                                                  or weather
  that you might live within it
                                                or by its constraints
  but never touch it—
                                and there is the sorrow
  it will never know you
though you feel all winter
                                          the shiver of how it never hesitates
  in touching you.
                            Or, said another way :
  it snowed all day and into the night.
                                                             The view developed
  slowly like a photograph
                                           in a bath of chemicals—
  what began as white
                                    grew whiter
  by virtue of contrast
                                    until it seemed overexposed
  so little shadow was left
                                          like a sentence revised too often.
  What happens is the mind
                                             travels outward
  because it wants to be the soul it has heard tell of.
                                                                                    Nervous work
  like a bird—sky and power line, garbage can, underbrush—
                                                                                                it goes to them;
  it intends itself toward oily black seeds
                                                                    toward reflections
  in ice and in glass
                                    and it goes to the wind
  and is shut out
                           which is no one’s home.
  Ever leave-taking,
                               action is its only description :
  each shadow on the lamp-lit street
                                                          seeming to rush—molting out of itself—
  each upward
                         to snow—
  multitude of hurry, confusion—midair
                                                            to meet the idea that made it—"
Emerson Susquehanna (ii. & ceased from our God of rhetoric),"But I don’t know

            small gears completely
  grease preening

  sheen of oil,
            charcoal—only
  this description eats

  to know the way?"
Emerson Susquehanna (i. “When we have lost our God of tradition),"Not thaw brought to the river—
            thought, long winter a surface that holds
no current or image.
            And there’s language laid down like that, mind
  locked in a long walk through the chill of a single word, and there’s cattails
            fraught where water’s not
any longer, and God’s a pall called down to mind the meaning
            given a life. Once thought
  the word makes mind too small
            like Bible-colored Sundays all study and chalk and exotic
potted palms dotting a holy land
            entirely crayon and the lavender mimeographs leave
  on the hands. The word God has always been my mother’s
            fingers separating
my sister’s hair, three strands gathered in a braid so tight white at the parted dark
            roots stood out, word
  a migraine in its wake, word endured alone in a room. Shades
            drawn over pain, word’s
a mind’s light ingrown, caught, nitid knot snarled upon
            itself…Subzero, months
  from thaw, we walk—o trees, trouble,
            tremble at the roots of being, underneath,
under laws, the order of things
            so deeply a violence and unnumbered like the snow."
The Haunted House,"I seem like one
Who treads alone
    Some banquet-hall deserted,
Whose lights are fled,
Whose garlands dead,
    And all but me departed.
            —Thomas Moore, “Oft in the Stilly Night (Scotch Air)”
See’st thou yon gray gleaming hall,
Where the deep elm-shadows fall?
Voices that have left the earth
                Long ago,
Still are murmuring round its hearth,
               Soft and low:
Ever there;—yet one alone
Hath the gift to hear their tone.
Guests come thither, and depart,
Free of step, and light of heart;
Children, with sweet visions blessed,
In the haunted chambers rest;
One alone unslumbering lies
When the night hath sealed all eyes,
One quick heart and watchful ear,
Listening for those whispers clear.
See’st thou where the woodbine-flowers
O’er yon low porch hang in showers?
Startling faces of the dead,
               Pale, yet sweet,
One lone woman’s entering tread
               There still meet!
Some with young, smooth foreheads fair,
Faintly shining through bright hair;
Some with reverend locks of snow—
All, all buried long ago!
All, from under deep sea-waves,
Or the flowers of foreign graves,
Or the old and bannered aisle,
Where their high tombs gleam the while;
Rising, wandering, floating by,
Suddenly and silently,
Through their earthly home and place,
But amidst another race.
Wherefore, unto one alone,
Are those sounds and visions known?
Wherefore hath that spell of power
               Dark and dread,
On her soul, a baleful dower,
               Thus been shed?
Oh! in those deep-seeing eyes,
No strange gift of mystery lies!
She is lone where once she moved,
Fair, and happy, and beloved!
Sunny smiles were glancing round her,
Tendrils of kind hearts had bound her;
Now those silver chords are broken,
Those bright looks have left no token;
Not one trace on all the earth,
Save her memory of their mirth.
She is lone and lingering now,
Dreams have gathered o’er her brow,
Midst gay songs and children’s play,
She is dwelling far away;
Seeing what none else may see—
Haunted still her place must be!"
The Price of the End of It,"But now it’s her stooped body in queue for the slab, 
her blessed temperature you’re fiddlin’ with, and God’s
holy directive shifts accordingly. Your mother holds 
the tasteful funeral home brochures an inch from her 
eyes until their horrible words unblur, shakes her head 
at the insane cost of the gilded, pall-borne tribute she truly 
craves, asks again for whatever’s cheap. May her Lord 
forgive you as you just keep shuffling that cremation info 
to the top of the pile. You remember how stupidly she 
bobs her napped head to the wagging finger of God, 
God again, always God, how resolutely she clutches 
all the bluish notes in gospel—for her, “the fire next 
time” is not a frugal means of disposing of soulless 
shells, it is payback for a life clawed together outside 
of her savior’s cold little classroom. Oh, never you mind 
the lesson she drilled into you after a handgun blasted 
your father out of the world, what she said to end your 
bouts of snot and fever, your worrisome new habits of 
snatching tufts of hair from your own head and screaming 
the onsets of dawn—Your daddy’s not in that ol’ body 
anymore— and you unrolled your eyes just in time to look 
that pliant, just in time to make her think you believed her.
Now that she has refused to the neat conclusion of ash,
you are thinking of all the damned reams of paperwork
glorious ceremony requires, the feel of scrawling your 
name over and over to officially end her. There will be too 
many syrupy, flowers draped over everywhere, the casket
lid flipped open, your oblivious mother’s vaguely 
whorish makeup job. You dread the hearse’s eerie creep 
through annoyed Ubers, the depressing pit, mourners 
sneaking cell snaps, taking note of your absence of ache. 
While this strange woman comparison-shops, zeroing in 
on the pauper’s special—Girl, what is a cloth casket?—
you remember years of screaming her name into a dead 
phone after she scrubbed her whole history of your needy 
little face. Now that she is frail and beholding, you should
demand that she answer for that kind of love. Or you
can love that way too. Go on. Throw a match into her hair.
 "
Don’t You Wanna,"A double golden shovel
C’mon in, out of that wretched hot, out of the hammer of heat, c’mon! 
Baby, don’t you let these blistering Chi streets put the dead on you. Baby,
don’t you hear that gravel groan, all those wails of been-done-wrong, don’t
you wanna dance, just once, with your backside ’gainst the floor? Don’t you
want to know how grown folk handle heartbroke? You know the boys want
to see all your sugarbottom dripping off a piece of barstool, they want to
go a little crazy with a lotta you on the dance floor. Loose that swivel! Go!
C’mon, sidle on up to the Alabama man on the mic, give him that come-on, 
baby, make him play that brown liquor song that ain’t got no bottom— Baby,
don’t go, please don’t go, he screeches, hurt all up in his neck. Please don’t
you leave me, woman! And like a blue man do, he already knows what you 
want, how you want it. You want to suffer to the roots of your wig, you want
to break the last written rules in the pulpit of this wicked church, you want to
go wallow in the nasty and the necessary, where every way out is alley, go
back to the west side and lunches of improbable pig, you want to go back 
to being a bowlegged goddess only a kingdom like Chicago could love. To
that, and to you, we raise our jelly jars brimming with hootch. You’re that
same woman who makes men know their knees. Yeah, you’re that same
ol’ gal who pains a man so hard his voice skips like a record. Only one ol’
place got the muscle to birth a woman as woman as you. Just one place,
sweet like Nehi grape soda and sour pickle peppermints. It’s our sweet
home, roguish and royal, that wild child riding the lip of a lake. It’s home.
Chicago is sky enough for a storm like you—a storm that hisses Chicago. 
 "
What Daughters Come Down To,"For what I’m sure is the fifth time, my mother
plugs in a flat mournful hum where the words
I love you too should be. Then she hangs up 
without saying goodbye. I squeeze my eyes
shut, try to imagine 82 autumns in the bones,
in her rasping joints, in the cool, jaded thump
of what is still a migrant’s ever-arriving heart.
However, I believe she is required to love me.
I wonder what God was teaching her all those 
years, those day after days coaxing raucous 
hips into deadening girdles and gray A-lines 
so she could lose her damned mind to organ. 
Was it all theater, a screeching of north when 
south was what itched her, all of it mock belly, 
the nails, splinter-spewing cross, some sly
spirit habitually overloading her spine, making
her dance thirsty and unfolded? How could all 
those wry hymns and hot-sauced hallelujahs 
lead to this hum, clipped connect and hush?
I am hundreds of miles away, but I can see
where she is sitting, hand still on the phone.
Every surface in her tiny apartment is scoured 
and bleached, draped in a disinfectant meld 
of rainshower and blades. The kitchen glints. 
Her rugs are faultless. The purpled tulips I 
have sent for her birthday are insistent feral 
beauty, a blood in the room. Like her daughter,
they have bloomed in the clutches of vapor. 
I love you too, she thinks out loud, but can’t."
The Succumbing,"For Firemen Joseph Graffagnino and Robert Beddia,
lost in the Deutsche Bank Building, NYC, August 18, 2007
  Sizzle, gallop, pushing spew of spark and angle,
fire beyond its normal rage and human border,
taunting skin. And Joseph’s cage is now collapsing,
barely, very barely, managing to hold his
thawing heart’s despairing claw, its shrinking language.
Landscape still beneath him, arms still blindly flailing,
Bobby must remember that to squelch the blazing
means to resurrect deceit, to conjure just the
sound of water on the tongue. The goddamned fools who
seek to save a wall must swallow razors, forkfuls
of a dimming light, must pray to conjure current.
Shuttered throats go craving for a gasp, a way to
scare the day aloose, to flood those shrinking roads with
fuel, whiskey—anything that flows. We’re running 
out of air. The burning riddle-spits, confounding
wind, and whittles towards the bursting bones of both our
boys. Days after, soft and sated smoke will drift like
bland religions up, till someone late for work—some 
sweating stressed New Yorker who barely snags the 6—
slams himself, panting, sideways in a seat. It’s hot 
as holy hell he spits, We’re going to die in here."
Ghazal of Oranges,"On New Year’s Eve, my father overfills the baskets with oranges,
mangoes, grapes, grapefruits, other citrus too, but mostly oranges.
The morning of the first, he opens every window to let the new year in.
In Chinatown, red bags sag with mustard greens and mandarin oranges.
A farmer in a fallow season kneels to know the dirt. More silt than soil,
he wipes his brow and mumbles to his dog: time to give up this crop of oranges.
The woman knows she let herself say too much to someone undeserving.
She lays her penance on her sister’s doorstep: a case of expensive oranges.
At the Whitney, I take a photo of a poem in a book behind the glass.
Above it, a painting: smears of blue, Frank O’Hara, his messy oranges.
The handsome server speaks with his hands: Tonight is grilled octopus
with braised fennel and olives, topped with peppercress, cara caras, and blood oranges.
No one at the table looks up, ashamed by the prices on the chic menus.
The busser fills my water and I inhale him: his faraway scent of oranges.
Seventh grade, Southern California: we monitored the daily smog alerts.
Red: stay inside. White: play outside. I forget what warning orange is.
Clutch was serious about art and said our final projects could be
whatever . . . performative . . . like, just show up with a wheelbarrow full of oranges.
Jan, in all of those first six years, why is all you can remember this:
the mist rising in the sunny air as you watched her peeling oranges."
Crazy When You Smile,"I’d never seen them up this close before
or ever known the awkward reckoning 
of our collapsing distance. Their hatred 
of what I am blooms wreckage on their skin,
their arms and faces blare in crimson while
they wave their placards with my breath
misspelled. I never thought that I would find
myself the object of foreboding thick 
enough to make a white man bare his teeth,
all Lucky Struck and rotting, just to hiss
a tightening noose in my direction, or spot 
a mother in a boxy robe of dimming flowers, 
hair all done up high and gelled, wrapped 
‘round Velcro rollers. She sidearms rocks 
at the window by my head—I refuse to flinch. 
She calls me monkey. I smile at her beyond 
and through the spidered cracking of the glass.
It really drives them crazy when you smile 
my father said this morning, while I scrubbed
my pimpled cheeks and picked my badass ‘fro 
to sky. Don’t let on that you’re mad or scared.
I can’t say that I really understood the strategy 
of being less of myself—pretending deafness, 
unremembering my fists. I know he was thinking
of those long ago students in Greensboro, stiff 
in their counter seats at Woolworth’s while 
keening white boys leered and drenched their 
heads with flour, ketchup, sugar, mustard,
spit. Perhaps there was a lesson to be learned.
But this is Boston, ten whole years from then,
and maybe I don’t want to be a martyr because 
to me it looks like nothing much has changed. 
I’m stiff in my seat on this bus while seething 
white folks scan the ground for stones, for shards 
of glass, for ways to break the skin that vexes 
them. I know that this is not the South, and yet 
it is. I know God said they know not what 
they do—but yeah, they do. I know that I am 
not a fool, and yet I feel like one. Like the coon 
they expect to see—smiling and swallowing. 
And everyone still sitting on the bus is silent—
fascinated by the spew of phlegm and venom 
smearing the windows, the way no matter how 
they sing our names it sounds like nigger—
nigger screeched so wide, so thousand times 
and so on-key. When they let me go I just might 
wear that new name home to show my father. "
Mister,"I don’t have the papers to travel to
the White Cliffs of Dover, but I imagine
it feels like the fog riding out at dawn.
My copper necklace
stays metallic even when misted.
I look for the statue of the local idol
who made this possible;
Maybe it has time to officiate a wedding between me
and the mist that’s gathered here today.
I want to be the groom it talks about the most,
especially to strangers that come from everywhere
to take pictures."
On Desire,"A firm hand. The shadow waves of satin.
I am not yet flesh. He calls me baby,
and I touch my face. I’m searching for god
when I oil my body in the mirror. To love it
means to love a man means an opening
to another man. When I take my glasses off
all the lines blur. A body is a body without
language, I tell my girlfriend and she laughs,
mouth wide enough to hide in. She shows me
my softest parts. I dissolve into what. I forget
hiding also means a good beating, the way
passion can be suffering. I can’t believe
my whole life I never touched what made me
holy. We have bread, butter and nowhere to be."
Overalls,"On a visit to my Amá’s, she drives us to the DMV.
She must renew her license every few months.
The asylum case has not yet been approved.
Not enough evidence that home is unsafe.
The line is long. The DMV is inside a mall.
In America, everything is for sale. Migrants
pay for safety. We pay people to believe
that what we tell them is true, especially
when we have spared them the hardest
facts to hold. Immigration, DMV, school,
and medical forms ask for our stories.
We pay for our stories too. We pay in smiles,
pretend laughs, head nods, empty stomachs,
panic attacks reserved for elevators,
migraines that will last four days but go
unnamed :: unuttered. After thirty-eight, or
forty minutes, we advance seven or so people
and the Carter’s window is visible from where
Amá and I stand. Overalls. My heart raises.
Eyes begin to shake. Mall lighting hurts
my eyes. I see five Carter’s logos and know
there is only one. I slam my back against the
glass windows. People look (and pretend they
don’t). I try to find my inhaler. It’s not in my
pockets. I close my eyes. I think about a boy.
Kissing a boy. I think about him more. I open
my eyes and look for my mother. Avoid looking
at the Carter’s again. The DMV does not
renew the license. Something about an error
or a glitch :: a document and migration :: (maybe)
a mother and a child. At five, I wore a pair of
overalls. Crossed a border in them too."
Lake of the Isles,"January 2021
After my grandfather died
I waited for him to arrive
In Minneapolis. Daily
I walked across the water
Wearing my black armband
Sewn from scraps, ears trained for his voice.
Migration teaches death, deprives us
Of the language of the body,
Prepares us for other kinds of crossings,
The endless innovations of grief.
Forty-nine days, forty-nine nights—
I carried his name and a stick
Of incense to the island in the lake
And with fellow mourners watched
As it burned a hole in the ice.
He did not give a sign, but I imagined him
Traveling against the grain
Of the earth, declining time.
Spirit like wind, roughening
Whatever of ourselves we leave bare.
When he was alive, he and I
Rarely spoke. But his was a great
And courageous tenderness.
Now we are beyond the barriers
Of embodied speech, of nationhood.
Someday, I will join him there in the country
Of our collective future, knowing
That loneliness is just an ongoing
Relationship with time.
It is such a strange thing, to be
Continuous. In the weeks without snow,
What do the small creatures drink?"
Haiku 2,"1
Outside, the thunder
Shakes the prison walls; inside
My heart shakes my ears.

(For Sonia)
Snow from the mountains
Of my heart instantly melts
In your warm Blackness.

Black men with Torches
Follow the bloody tracks of
The albino beast.

Gray jets drag white tails
Across blue skies; gray rats drag
Tails across black legs."
Huey,"Wel / come back, brother
from…
the House of many Slams
to
these mean bricks
a poet
sung to me:
lets us
drink wine in the alley
and dance in the streets
everyday people
have found
a prince
bright-eyed
wonder-child
comes 
Revolution."
To Dinah Washington,"I have heard your voice floating, royal and real,
Across the dusky neighborhoods,
And the eyes of old men grow bright, remembering;
Children stop their play to listen,
Remembering—though they have never heard you before,
You are familiar to them:
Queen of the Blues, singing an eternal song.
In the scarred booths of Forty-Third street,
“Long Johns” suck in their bellies,
On the brass studded leather of Elite-town,
Silk-suited Bucks raise their chins…
Wherever a man is without a warm woman,
Or a woman without her muscled man,
The eternal song is sung.
Some say you’re sleeping,
But I say you’re singing.
Unforgettable Queen."
Yellow Wood,"Mother taught me.
I learned about despair when
I smiled instead of weeping
as she’d sit blue as the
heavy pot belly stove,
overcome with a promise tinted
futility;
angry as God
between her affair with sweep and scrub.
Needing laughter
she’d think of a stronger arm,
but seeing me:
a holy devil protested,
decently attacking
thin floors
that spun
undefeatable yellow.
Thinking quiet in my toy,
I watched
looking cool 
for mother."
The Swallow,"Little lone swallow frequenting the skies in the bleakness of oncoming rain,
Gloating on the view by the river reflected when days of sun reappear,
You who can sing in the fulness of sorrow, and in seasons of gladness usefully sing,
You who in mirth and melancholy alike find joy, joy in you we find.
We who aspire to vistas beyond us and only can lift our eyes,
We who live in transient gladness and hovering gloom,
We of the earth who cannot fly with you.
What life is yours who pursue not pleasure and yet have it,
You who know sorrow and by it be left unoppressed
You who in shadow arise, and in sunshine pensively dream on the river,
Of gladness not taking nor little nor much,
Of sorrow the master more often than not,
Knowing the one and the other as passing, imperfect,
Passing as the clouds in the bleakness of oncoming rain,
Imperfect as the vista by the river reflected when days of sun reappear."
Manila Bay,"I sit upon the white rocks by the bay,
Against whose hollows numberless, the waves
Will splash forevermore. The sunset laves
The deep with light. There rise far away
A mountain that has seemingly defied
The very clouds unchanged. And near, portending
That all created things will have an ending,
These crumbled crags lie by the ocean side!
O time! what element escapes your slow
And causeless move? These rough, resisting rocks,
Which the wind startled wave incessant mocks,
Are not to it unyielding even now.
The day is done, for once it had a beaming,
And so must all, whatever may be seeming."
Intramuros,"Out where the wild vines spread
Upon the winding walls,
I hear melodious madrigals
And music from the dead.
There where the grasses hang
Their canopy of leaves,
Which oft at dawn receives
Matins the mayas sang,
Where peace holds solemn sway
On mounted mossy squares,
Where panting thoroughfares
Are heard, but far away...
There will I sit and sing,
Far from the tramp of feet
Upon the crowded street,
And dream of crown and king.
Old walls now mouldering
In quiet, silent ease,
They knew not then of peace
When glory was their king.
They tell of a long-lost reign
And love-forsaken beauty,
Of sentinels on duty
With musket and with wine!
Of war and wrathful fight,
Of surging mob and crowd,
Protesting clear and loud
Against the law of might.
Of pirate Limahongs
That raided towns and coasts,
While vengeful hordes and hosts
Were shouting war-time songs.
Of sailors bold and brave,
Of buccaneer Van Noort,
Morga, who sailed from port,
The Spanish flag to save.
And of the years before,
When king was Soliman,
Whose rajah blood outran
To free his native shore.
Here once they help parade
Of saints and flaming torches,
Where now are crumbled churches
And convents all decayed!
Ah, walls that totter must,
Walls of pride and of power,
Living their day and hour,
Only to go to dust!
Walls, olden, ancient walls,
How many memories
And dismal harmonies
To mind your presence calls."
Among the Hills,"I used to watch the sunrise glow
That set aflame the eastern skies,
My lips in songs did freely flow
As thoughts went fleeting with my sighs.
I’ve lived through storms and smiles and tears,
And seen familiar faces die,
Ah, these, my weary youthful years
Are fraught with shades of dreams gone by.
And yet when once again I see
The glory of the purpling hills,
My dying heart revives to be
A spring of loves and lover’s thrills.
My mind in youth did ever roam
Across the mountains and the dales,
And now my heart has found a home
Among the eastern hills and vales."
Love,"In life there is no pleasure
To love and youth unknown,
For love is life’s one treasure,
And love and life are one.
In youth there is one sorrow
To love and life well known,
For beauty fades to-morrow
When youth from love has flown.
But love is like the shower
That waters gardens dry,
And brings to earth a flower
That blooms, but cannot die."
My Home,"Up by a leaping stream,
And cradled ’neath the hills,
The hallowed moments seem
Eternities of thrills.
The river runs its course
Half round my little nest,
Where birds are never hoarse
Singing in play and rest.
O’er the roof the cadenas creep,
Soft grasses clothe the lawn,
Which with the twilight weep
And pray for a new dawn.
At morn the butterflies
Are early on the wing,
And when the evening dies,
I hear the late bird sing.
There joy no sorrows mar,
Its cup is empty never,
Wherein griefs, falling, are
Lost in the depths forever."
Awakening,"’T is time this heart indifferent
     To love so long,
Should rise from slumber impotent,
     And stroll among
The gardens that are heaven sent.
The butterflies’ unholy quest
     From vase to pot
For wine within the petal’s nest,
     Will guide me not
As it profanely guides the rest.
But it is time this heart so long
     Indifferent
For years and years, should stroll along
     Where Cupid went
One day, and listened to his song."
An Invite to Eternity,"                            1
Wilt thou go with me sweet maid
Say maiden wilt thou go with me
Through the valley-depths of shade,
Of night and dark obscurity,
Where the path has lost its way
Where the sun forgets the day
Where there’s nor life nor light to see
Sweet maiden, wilt thou go with me?
                            2
Where stones will turn to flooding streams
Where plains will rise like ocean waves
Where life will fade like visioned dreams
And mountains darken into caves
Say maiden wilt thou go with me
Through this sad non-identity
Where parents live and are forgot
And sisters live and know us not?
                            3
Say maiden wilt thou go with me
In this strange death of life to be
To live in death and be the same
Without this life, or home, or name
At once to be, and not to be
That was, and is not—yet to see
Things pass like shadows—and the sky
Above, below, around us lie? 
                            4
The land of shadows wilt thou trace
And look—nor know each other’s face,
The present mixed with reasons gone
And past, and present all as one.
Say, maiden can thy life be led
To join the living to the dead?
Then trace thy footsteps on with me
We’re wed to one eternity."
Maria Clara,"A rose and a lily she was, 
pure yet passionate for the love that she bore. 

Futile to her were the wiles of hypocrisy,
Harmless the proffers of dons from Spain. 

For she thought and thought only of him who was pilgrim
To the holiest holy land, 
A crusader at the gates of his sanctuary pausing, praying, 
Unable to enter there. 

In her the meek and the suffering found the heart
Of a woman to works of love devote, 
Ibarra, the gloomy, the fiery, the tempter of fate, 
Could see in her face a glimpse of tranquil peace.

That night, when alone with him whom she loved, 
She communed in fevered, intoxicant bliss, 
That night when he left her alone, 
He to be hunted to death. . . 
Her arms uplifted were protest, remonstrance
From the triumph of greed and desire. "
Solitude,"Stars of the sky come out on the earth, 
Out of the void of the sky, 
Out of the clouds, 
Of the mantle-clouds of the sky, 
Come, 
Come for the moon is pale. 
Pallid and spectral
As the night, 
Dead as the clouds of the night. 
Wake from the woodland, winds, 
Wanton and wail on the sea, 
Move where the billows, rent and restless, 
Are mute. 
Rise from the clod and sea and air, 
Arise, O forms that are lifeless, inert, 
Start as by impulse
And tremble to being. 
Now the light of the stars and the spheres, 
Now the breath of the wind
And the rush of the watery waste, 
Are motionless, 
Immobile, 
Dead. 
Only the tumult, 
The fire and the flame in the heart are here
Within, the beat and the pulse
Of long agitations
Perturb. 
Longings for the loved ones lost, 
Loved as the waves of the wind, 
Loved as the stars of the night, 
Lost as the wind and the night, 
Lost as the waves and the spheres. 
Without, 
In the cold, lightless silence of night. 
All is mute, 
All is dead. "
The Fisherman,"A fisherman wades, knee-deep in the water, 
Feeling the stones at the bottom with his feet and his fork, 
Lighting his way with an oil-fed torch of bamboo. 
And the curtain of darkness behind him, 
And the halo of light before him,
Wrap the homely-looking man and his four-pointed fork
In chimeras of unreality. 
Ringing faintly comes the song of a siren
From under the rocks where he walks. 
And the fisherman seems like the siren endowed
With the mirthless melody of waves,
Though a sound he makes not, nor speaks in the silence. 
A merman he seems, bewailing his lost and his children
At midnight (and midnight it was when he went to the shore). 
And the fork in his hand
Looks like the scepter of the king of the sea. . . .
A king, bereft of his children, 
A ruler deserted by the queen of the sea. "
A Coast-Nightmare,"I have a friend in ghostland—
   Early found, ah me, how early lost!—
Blood-red seaweeds drip along that coastland
   By the strong sea wrenched and tossed.
In every creek there slopes a dead man’s islet,
   And such an one in every bay;
All unripened in the unended twilight:
   For there comes neither night nor day.
Unripe harvest there hath none to reap it
   From the watery misty place;
Unripe vineyard there hath none to keep it
   In unprofitable space.
Living flocks and herds are nowhere found there;
   Only ghosts in flocks and shoals:
Indistinguished hazy ghosts surround there
   Meteors whirling on their poles;
Indistinguished hazy ghosts abound there;
   Troops, yea swarms, of dead men’s souls.—
Have they towns to live in?—
   They have towers and towns from sea to sea;
Of each town the gates are seven;
   Of one of these each ghost is free.
Civilians, soldiers, seamen,
   Of one town each ghost is free:
They are ghastly men those ghostly freemen:
   Such a sight may you not see.—
How know you that your lover
   Of death’s tideless waters stoops to drink?—
Me by night doth mouldy darkness cover,
   It makes me quake to think:
All night long I feel his presence hover
   Thro’ the darkness black as ink.
Without a voice he tells me
   The wordless secrets of death’s deep:
If I sleep, his trumpet voice compels me
   To stalk forth in my sleep:
If I wake, he hunts me like a nightmare;
   I feel my hair stand up, my body creep:
Without light I see a blasting sight there,
   See a secret I must keep."
Altered,"He left for Manila one day in April. 

Said good-by to the principal street in town, 
To the tall, austere cathedral beside it. 

At home the evening before, 
His mother and he a seedling in the back-yard planted. 

He stayed in the city seven years and came back in April. 

He strolled in the town as he often had 
With friends in his youth, years ago. 

Calle Real was an alley at the brook commencing, 
Ending, parted in three at the rice-fields. 
By the alley a chapel stood. 

The seedling he sowed, his mother beside him, 
So tiny then when he left for Manila, 
To a flowering tree had grown. 

And the tree by the others called sampaga for seven years, 
He called love, 
And his mother kissed him, calling him love. "
Unsophistication,"The stir of business relapses to silence
With the slowly sinking sun. 
The revels of pleasure commence for the weary. 

But children peering in the deepening dusk
From playmates and playthings the livelong day, 
Children in tiny, toy-houses know not
What night always brings to older, wiser men. 

At the hills where the tremulous shafts of light are flung
On a sea and a sky of gold, 
Children throw a look, careless, 
Transient as the beauty they see not, 
As the sight they cannot enjoy, nor in losing regret,
Like men sophisticated. 

Children at twilight cease from their labor and frolic, 
Impatient of morning. 
From prodigal play, ungetting, 
They sleep ungiven to the pleasure and fancy
Of older, wiser men. "
Sonnet [Whyfore must minstrels unattended sing],"Whyfore must minstrels unattended sing
And utter sounds by no one understood?
The shy doves coo their music to the wood
And wild—as soon responsive echoes sing:
Perfuméd flowers impetuously will fling
Such exhalations like to harmony;
The moaning waves, the blood-red clouds on high,
In our soul’s sympathy are wantoning;
But these the poets offer from their art,
Are whispers wafted from some alien strain.
Perhaps they rise as secrets of the heart,
That, surging, sink, and, sinking, surge again,
Perhaps the accents geniuses impart,
Aroused by godly impulse, heard in vain."
Suspense,"At Mount Mariveles, twilight lazily lingers, 
And the sun descending, almost out of sight, 
Into the hills and the seas beyond the hills, 
Goes down hesitating, slowly, 
While the night of music and mystery waits, 
And the evening of colored lights wonders and waits
As lingers the indolent, twilight sun. 

And the little Luneta is filled to capacity. 
Crowds go there by habit as now they have gone
On this long Christmas eve. 
And the restless people, 
The band men who play to the people there, 
And the new repertoire at the stands prepared, 
Impatiently await the sun sinking slowly
Behind Mariveles miles distant. 

A boy-lover at a gate strains his ear for the six-o‘clock bell, 
At the churchyard another is reckoning time, 
Looking at the minute-hand, 
Grasping the rope to the belfry and bells. 
Children at play stand in the glimmering dusk, 
Doubting if the sun had set
Or if the mother from the window had called to supper and sleep. 

At the concert men look at their watches, 
Women turn sideways for friends and faces familiar, 
And the gallants forget to smoke 
And the flirts to flutter their fans, 
And all glance at the red, full-orbéd sun in the west, 
Loitering, lingering lazily in Bataan, 
While people to the west, leagues and leagues away, 
Stir from bed and peep from lattices and chinks in the walls, 
Watchful of dawn. "
Wages,"Twigs from the tree tops fallen,
Leaves by the zephyrs in ecstasy dropped,
Vines looking up
At the bark they had clung to but lately,
Till the breezes came their way . . . .
They are scattered and helpless,
Wistful of glories once theirs for a day.
Sands on the shoreline,
Crags from their setting torn to pieces,
By splash and spray . . . .
Mortals go near them unthinking of agony there.
Winds will break in tempests.
Oceans burst into waves . . .
Man must have music, not counting the pain and the price
In fallen leaves in the garden,
In broken stones by the shore."
Sonnet [Upon these deeps in days remotely old],"Upon these deeps in days remotely old,
A daring band of Malays flung their sails
Intrepidly. On tempests, storms, and gales,
On ocean furies, full their valor told,
Each gust a grave, each grave a tale unscrolled,
A covert pathos of the tongueless wave
For utterance suspiring. O the brave
Unnumbered dead that slumber in their fold!
Some day a bark of light will Hereward glide.
By no one sent, whence no one living knows,
And, breaking centuries of deep repose,
Upgather from the sea the dead who died
In search of it. A gleam these deeps will tear,
And give new life to all that slumbered there."
Argonauts,"From Asia’s teeming highlands, coasts and bays,
They ploughed the outmost rim of ocean foam,
In pathless deeps envisioning a home
Where suns perennial drop unslanted rays.
They ventured from the people-trodden ways,
And in their light, swift-wingéd barangays,
The seas below, aloft the flaming skies,
They found the ocean haven of Malays.
They set their eyes on points unvisited,
On wave-lapped isles enchantedly remote,
The yawning reefs kept tally of the dead,
Transforming into graves the homes they sought.
From Asia’s naked shores by fancy led,
They spread their sails, and drifted, monsoon-caught."
Unforgotten,"I met and then forgot her
With unremembered things,
And thought if love could utter
Once more its murmurings,
Another one and not her
Could pluck the muted strings.
The years had passed long after
That sweet romance and free––
Kind years that seemed to waft her
From painful memory,
For she brought tears and laughter
And sorrow, too, for me.
I thought the pain and yearning
Had gone away from mind,
And cold the bosom burning
With passion unresigned,
Till I saw her returning
With Love and Spring behind."
Azaleas,"appear in all the early photos.
My arms belted around my mother,
only the top of my head seen
because she has spoken sharply
and now resorts to begging.
“Your father hasn’t seen you
in eight weeks. Smile. Smile!”
I am too sad or sick to obey
and she makes that sound
between her teeth that
signals the end of a unit
of patience. I release her
and dash off. What follows
I don’t remember. Only after,
dawdling along the hedge,
touching the little flaring flowers.
There are so many that as I run
my hand along, I meet more,
nothing else. The top of my head
is hot from sun. I understand
I am two girls. The one my mother
wants and the one who lives only
among her own kind."
Tears,"She felt alone
In that garden unfrequented,
Where the winds make moan
For blossom sweetly scented,
Perfumed but far away.
And as the sunset died,
Lost the last long twilight ray,
She felt so lone and cried.
Her face protesting revealed
The trace of promises and prayers unreturned,
Deep disillusions learned,
Sorrows silence-sealed.
And as she wept
Like a lost child
When the shadow of twilight crept
On the forest wild,
Not knowing the ground,
As tears and tear-drops falling,
Moistened the cheek of the night around,
I called, she heard me calling,
And longer cried in that garden frequented only
By her spirit loving and lovely."
Lost Glimpses,"A fairy came out of the woods,
A creature bewitchingly fair;
A dress would have stolen the beauty
Half-hid by the locks of her hair.
She said that not far from the wilds,
Where the rill gives itself to the brook,
She had seen what for years I was searching
In cavern and crevice and nook.
She led me the way to a spring,
Where to drink meant awakening love;
A draught of the cool, magic waters
Brought pleasure untasted above.
Expectant, I closed on her steps,
We came to the brook and the rill,
But the spring was not there nor elsewhere,
And the woodland was silent and still.
Then sternly, not looking, I asked,
“Where, O fairy, is that which I seek?”
There was nothing but silence for answer,
No fairy was there then to speak."
Sonnet [Our days in swift succession bid us on],"Our days in swift succession bid us on
To these unchartered, desolate domains,
Where over deserts strewn with the remains
Of unreturning caravans long gone,
We follow trails that, winding, go astray
Into the dull horizon. We know not
What ending’s there, what fortunes be our lot,
When tired and spent we reach our destined way.
We only know that with each onward move,
We leave behind us friends we cherished most,
Old friends, who, unsustained, their path have lost,
Warm hearts that, hoping, beat for those they love.
We know that time relentless bids us on
To stranger lands, only to dead men known."
Mirage,"I saw in dreams a landscape
With not a shadow by,
It seemed so like a promise
Half-hidden in the sky.
There were high hills and mountains
In purple drest and green,
Like shades and shapes fantastic
Only in dreaming seen.
The waters clear and limpid
Had but a speck to mar,
For in the depths was mirrored
The image of a Star.
Only but once there hovered
Indistinct forms and lone,
Calling to mind the faces
I knew in days by-gone.
I seemed to see them falter
As they were lost to view,
They paused and fell to doubting
Which pathway to pursue.
To them faint words were given,
I thought I heard them say,
We know not where to wander,
But cannot choose to stay.
“Over the realms of heaven
We silently must rove,
With but the Star to guide us
Back to the friends we love.”
Ah, fleeting are the fancies,
Deceiving us too well,
Nor sage nor saint can fathom
The mysteries they tell."
Singing Funeral,"I’ve avoided opening my throat in fear the dead would rise, walk out of me, leave me emptier after their fleeting, and still get deported back into the abyss they climbed from. I don’t think they hunger me. They want to abandon and find a soft rock to lay their head on, a voice, an empty water jug, a song, the striking pain of a windless and deserted desert or a revolver or drugs or gang affiliations. Instead I hoax them to sit perched, their black wings all slick and crow-like while I drag the weight of Mexican unsung mourning in choir. Now I have someone to blame. My brother isn’t coming back from the dead and I won’t fix my scale. The tone will always be off, a crooked meteor slicing what’s left of the sky. Songs will remain unsung, the diaphragm, a cheap staircase, not even lullabies can squeeze out, my voice box sealed, a better state line than the Mexican-American border. This time mami won’t become one million doves in the driver seat while she sings to Jenni Rivera as we drive through the sandstorm. Instead she hardens, tells me of the desert roses tumbling across the desert, how just like us they have razor sharp petals as armor on their body from tumbling aimlessly for years. Memory still doesn’t strike a guitar string, the tíos are turning in their grave, while abuelita twists her mouth so we don’t see her teethless. We all have this disease, a black dove chewing on its feathers inside of a country inside us, trapped in the cave of us, we rage or corridos Chihuahuenses or a dying ensemble, but even if the song kills me I won’t set it free. It’s obvious I must avoid the eulogy that comes after talking about my brother’s death because it’ll haunt me, his death, it will follow me and take me too, and I want to sleep tonight."
The Immigrant,"will become a pessimist                            eventually

the immigrant always an immigrant       there is no returning"
Mother,"When evenings cast pale shadows on the earth,
And silence, like a vast mysterious ghost,
Stifles the land and sea from hill to coast,
And buries all that tropic suns gave birth,
When by myself I pace the darkened shore,
And think of this unhappy lot of mine,
The pain and grief the fates to me assign,
I sigh for you, O mother I adore!
That I could seek your bosom as of old,
And, nestling there, bare secrets that oppress,
Accuse these that my love would disposses,
Whose hearts to cold desires and base are sold!
O mother dear! When death relieves our sighs,
Shall we in heaven, meet, in Paradise?"
Parting,"Upon a path we lingered
When skies were overcast,
She knew not I was doubting
If love had come at last.
In her I felt arising
The pity Christ thought of––
To me naught else did matter
If only she could love.
To me unkind was pity,
And hurting, gratitude,
My love was more than kindness,
For thanks from her too good.
She said in lasting friendship
How happy we could be––
She did not know her hatred
Less painful were to me.
I said if love she could not,
’T were better to forget,
That in the flush of summer,
Upon that lane we met."
Delirium,"In this state of the mind when the least sound perplexes,
And the faintest light shadow the spirit depresses,
When the pen, hesitating, conjectures and guesses
On the scheme enigmatic of mortals and sexes;
When the twilight with shadow the bosom but vexes,
And the morning with sunlight the temper oppresses,
When society of men a mere boredom expresses,
And the phantom of silence, a war of complexes:
Then I think of the second new life of hereafter,
Which will claim at a call my lone soul from the earth,
Of the day when I cease from all tear-drops and laughter,
When the born things are dead, and the dead given birth.
From my bed of repose I, recalling, would waft her
The one halcyon remembrance of our passionate mirth."
Ennui,"I slept in the frenzy
And delirium of men and their cities.
Close by the streets and the cross-ways of traffic,
Deep in the waste of houses
Where multitudes unsmiling are homeless,
Mouldered the hut of my life, care-deserted,
Of a haven of slumber and open-eyed sleep,
Of peace for my soul.
To the world and its whirling of men in disorder,
To the riot of manifold unvaried activities
From the pain of birth to the pleasure of death.
I lived not,
I slept for the peace of my soul.
Ears I had but I heard not
The clamor of bells from churches and towers of stone,
I heard not the clink of metal,
The groaning of iron
With the weight of passengers and wheels of iron,
The whistle from long-throated chimneys,
The siren of sound and smoke from the piers.
To the clanking of steel,
To the hissing of vapor from pent-up boilers
In the shops on the street, in the ships on the stream,
To the thud of machines against factory walls,
And of trucks on the adamant road in the open,
To the motley news-boys shrieking,
And the rabble of crowds on the street, on the square,
In a rush of commotion and fury
To the sounds, discordant, erratic, out of tune,
Cadenceless, out of time,
I was rock, unresponsive, alien, remote,
They were silence
And echoes sepulchral of silence in tombs.
Life that stirred from the vitals of creatures
Howling and wakeful in graves . . . .
Death that returned with the ebb and recession
Of life-refusing love
These to me meant nothing, when confusion was all they could mean.
Love that was hatred merely,
Hatred begotten of love unrequited,
Pity self-seeking, self-centered, selfish,
Friendship of hearts that were hollow of feeling,
Passions let loose
And cravings run wild,
These were the forces of fire and power titanic
Oppressing the flesh of a spirit rebellious
For freedom of pleasure,
For freedom from pain.
I slept forgetful of self,
Unconcerned about others living for their own
In a half-mad world.
Of desire unmindful,
Forgetting care and canker and chaos,
I slept with Endymion, loved of the moon, perpetual,
In the wilderness of cities,
In the wasteland of war."
Sonnet [This day when waking from pertubéd sleep],"This day when waking from pertubéd sleep,
I see the dim night die upon the dawn,
And gaze on gleaming hill and dewy lawn,
On sunbeams soft that o’er the valley peep;
When Nature seems with ecstasy to weep
At seeing earth and sky so lovely grown,
And innocently to herself alone
Counts and recounts the flowers and clouds they keep,
How clearly do I see through thin green leaves
The truth that only beauteous dawns arouse;
The smallness of the mortal man who grieves,
Whose eyes to loveliness perpetual drowse.
O blesséd morning! how the long dead heaves
To life, suspiring on the blossoming boughs."
Five American Sentences,"To prove to an unseen someone, a future self, that I am enough.
A loved one drowning, just out of hands’ reach; hover your hand above a flame.
That person is gone from this earth, what we could’ve evolved to is finished.
You are now in this world without his esteem, untethered, the string snapped.
I too, someday, will end, & this forgetting is a kind of freedom."
The Garden of Earthly Delights,"  He is imminent, they have told us, a softer way of saying
he is about to die, like the words passed away, passed
to a place that is far, not here, cannot or will not
say where. Passed, as if through a threshold, to a place
we cannot follow, unknown to us. He died. It has a thud
to it, a spade of soil, the two d’s standing at either side
like bookends, died, bracing the solitary i, the self & the e,
his initial. His signature, a perfect birdswoop of wings.
           And taking him by the hand, he flexes his fingers in his sleep,
as if strumming guitar strings, notes that resound
in the caves of Sacromonte, geraniums in clay pots.
A puzzle on the table, half completed, all that blue & green,
grass & sky, tiny naked bodies, towers of fleshy fruits, a carousel
of dancing animals, & from somewhere comes
the music of a guitar, notes played by an unseen hand.
The adagio echoes in that whitewashed cave as we watch him pass."
Relinquenda,"The snake always slips into the bushes when I start down the path.
The snake is just the tail end of what’s happening.
The snake doesn’t look back.
The snake is not an animal I identify with.
I mean, it’s a garden-variety queen snake but I’d still lop off its head with a machete.
Isn’t it expected that one thing will chase another?
Isn’t it normal to want your space?
About this snake, it’s not the kind that holds its tail in its mouth.
About this machete, I do not own one.
About this path, I chose it.
It’s narrow.
About this metaphor, it stretches out like a tightrope.
And these lines force one foot in front of the other.
And these steps are the ones I have to take.
About the snake, I must circle back.
About the time I left the door open.
About the zero surprise I felt when our eyes locked.
As if what I needed was a mirror.
As though I would always lead her in & back her into a corner.
As soon as I extend my hands, she coils into her self.
As soon as I take another step, she slashes the cord."
The Moon,"I, too, am tired of it. And yet, like an old love,
it comes to us, illuminating the bare walls
of our houses, catching its hems
on our thresholds, carrying its little cup of blossoms.
We are done with it.
Aren’t we done with it?
We have told ourselves
only grace can change us;
we have told ourselves
the craft is not the magic;
we have told ourselves
the myths are in our hands.
And yet, Issa wrote to us, and ever.
Let us walk out through the summer grass
and be there. Let us look up through the deepest leaves
and open. Let us wait, then,
while the ancient things
are woken, because haven’t
we always been lonely,
haven’t we looked up
into the wild skies
and asked, too, to be luminous
and ruined,
and risen like this cold stone in the darkness
and changed in it as radiantly as we can?
 "
Hymn,"Nec vitia nostra nec remedia pati possumus
                                    – Livy
  We are like strangers in the wild places. We watch
the deer swinging the intricate velvet from its antlers, never knowing
we are only as immense as what we shed in the dance.
The bride and bridegroom stand at the altar. Each thing
learned in mercy has as river in it. It holds the cargo
of a thousand crafts of fire that went down at evening.
We can neither endure our misfortunes nor face
the remedies needed to cure them. The fawns move
through the forest, and we move through the ruins of the dance.
Like Job, the mourner lays his head on the cold oak
of the table. His heart is a hundred calla lilies
under the muck of the river, opening before evening.
We think there is another shore. We stand with the new life
like a mooring rope across our shoulders, never guessing
that the staying is the freightage of the dance.
Orpheus turned to see his Eurydice gone. The Furies tore him
into pieces. The sun, he said, I will worship the sun.
But something in his ruin cried out for evening, evening, evening.
The wrens build at dusk. Friends, I love their moss-dressed
nests twisting in the pitch of the rafters, for they have taught me
that the ruins of the dance are the dance.
 "
Traffic,"Shouting in the sky-walled air.
The rig-driver’s voice is husky and his throat is hoarse with yelling and shouting in the sky-cooped air.
He jerks the flesh-cutting reins and he dangles the sharp, blood-dripping lash.
The horse is hungry.
The legs are not sure of their footing as the animal heavily gasps for breath,
Its blood kept warm by the cutting reins and whistling lash of the master with the harsh, angry voice,
Its legs propelled by the smell of sweat and blood and distant bundles of grass,
By the ceaseless urge of the creaking of the wheels behind,
By the patter of hoofs on the pavement and the hollow, unmusical echoes.
The animal thinks of the sharp-toned man of the reins and the lash that cuts as sharply,
Of the unbreathing monsters of steel that brush past him without effort,
Of the frail-footed men whom his master slavishly obeys and the round, silver pieces that pass from hand to hand,
Of the bundled zacate that he smells in the distance.
The rig-man’s musings are far from his laboring horse.
He thinks of his waiting wife and counts in his mind the fare he will empty on her lap.
He thinks of the swift-coursing car which riders prefere to his clumsy, creaking, two wheeled rig.
He swings the lash to dispel thoughts of baffled, defeated toil,
And to quicken his slackening horse.
In the rig, a young man stares at the vacant space beside him which in former days was not so.
And again he sees twin stars luminous in the darkness,
Pretty red lips parted with the laughter and wine of kisses stolen, yielded kisses and kisses unasked,
A warm, soft body pressed close against his own,
The perfume of her that sent the blood running in savage tumult through his veins.
Creaking wheels,
Patter of hoofs on the pavement,
Echoes,
Whistling and kissing of reins and the lash,
The young man’s dreams are brushed cruelly aside.
And he sends a sigh to the sky-walled air at the grim, heartless world of fact."
Repentance,"I have flown over flowers of perfume,
Fondled and touched them before,
I have kissed them so often
And hotly,
That their lips seemed unmeaning to mine.
I am haunted by a meaning of petals
Hovering in vain
In the mind,
I am startled by a new significance
The petals convey with their eyes.
I am frightened by a thought that their color
Of purple and white provokes.
I see a red flower,
I smell a white rose,
I pluck them not
By my eyes from the sight of these!
I falter to look into them
And fail to touch them now.
Ah! these eyes and hands that have often
With a gaze, a caress profane, polluted the pure!
What lips are these to speak of flowers,
O! what lips, what lips are these!
Listless lips
Cursed with kisses in moments unholy
Of shame!
I must leave these flowers of morning.
I must leave unprofaned
These petals consecrated
To mothers on earth,
To mothers in heaven.
From purposed forgetfulness
I peep on a dawn of flowers which I
Must not see.
I will sleep to forget them again
As I have forgotten before."
Pagan Passion,"I am sweetly perplexed by love sallies, releases,
By the countless retreats and the numberless captures,
By the petulant coldness and agreeable raptures,
By the whisper of phrases that hurts and then pleases,
I am drunk by the prodigal total of leases
From her body and spirit, her soul and her senses,
I revel in approaches and artless offenses,
In her challenging taunts and her tenderly teases.
Now will I disengage a red flower from her tresses,
And uplift her lithe form from a divan of roses,
For the zephyr of night too much passion opposes,
And in delicate folds now has rumpled her dresses.
On tomorrow’s new ventures the heart eager presses,
I repose now to ponder on life-soothing losses."
October,"This is the season in which the lambs begin
to die, in which the boy in his red and blue plaid
shirt gets down on his wrists and his knees to crawl
into the moorland at night and spread a cross of pumice
on their foreheads, in which he reads to them a hymn
like a freighter burning with a cargo of ripened fruit
because in the morning he will have to kill them.
Because in the morning he will wake to find his father
standing in the hall like a horse with a lamp in its mouth
and he will have to wade into a river with only that silence
in his arms, and he will harm them. Because every year
I watch him stand at the threshold of a season and begin
to call them, to hold the ruined bodies of the dead
with only a dim chord of flame between his lips
and to touch them, to touch them
and to be with them, to touch them
and to sing with them, the way a child
touches everything, with the hand of his murderer.
 "
Letter,"Tonight, as you walk out
into the stars, or the forest, or the city,
look up
as you must have looked
before love came,
before love went,
before ash was ash.
Look at them: the city’s
mists, the winters.
And the moon’s glass
you must have held once
in beginning.
That new moon
you must have touched once
in the waters,
saying change me, change
me, change me. All I want
is to be more of what I am.
 "
Mimesis,"A thinnest sliver
Of new moon light
At the horn tips of mule deer
Turned toward us
Their dark eyes don’t know
Our dry heels imitate the mountains
“Women imitate the earth”
House finches, quaking,
Imitate chambers
Like Daniel’s prints saying freedom
without love posted along the outskirts
Men wielded mirrors at men
Making of each the other’s babies
Spun ‘round
While the rest of us stayed in bed
And in our closed eyes felt the touch
Of light was a given
To use if we felt like it
As Aleppo pines thread deserts
Still silent in their roots
We will get up
In a movie about us
We’ll go to a higher desert
Only the thinnest air in our way
Released, certain accents will flare
Our mouths saying,
“Suppose one is bred an immigrant”
Citrus groves having been husbanded
Somewhere behind you
And you don’t get too precious
Like things are very small, really
They just turn over and get lost
Across several versions of the portrait
Ragged edged, the mirror, its useful mercury
Sonorous behind the glass, almost a return
Before first light assembles the blue
Then what can we tell?
We took a dialect
From a lineage they took
Only as far as the mountains
We know how to get thin and turn,
Saying, “I’m not
really interested in my affect”
However mannered,
             “Uh-huh,”
The poem says back"
Odysseus,"Think of the moment before the moment.
Before recognition. Before the nurse saw
the boar’s scar coursing down his thigh
where the world had first entered him
in the forests of childhood. Before
Penelope. Before his battle for her heart.
Think of his moment alone on the beach,
his sailors running up to the village
where girls stood wringing spices
from their hair. Think of the gods saying to him
you do not have to praise ruin anymore;
you do not have to praise what is lost.
How you imagine him is how you enter things.
He is kneeling. Or he is weeping. Or he is turning
toward the sea again, thinking of the great deeds
of the hopeless. Think of him lifting the sands
and touching them to his tongue, to see
if it is real. If it is home. If it is time. Think of the moment
before he knew he had stepped out of the myths
and into his life. Whether that means to you
that he would sing, or mourn, or be lessened.
And his patience when he rose up again
and took himself the long way
toward his kingdom, not knowing
if it had all changed, or if love
had lasted, or if anything can last.
Think of him as though he were your life,
as though you had sat waiting at a loom
for long, dark years, weaving and unweaving
what you are. Think of your life returning to you
with eyes that had seen death. And whether
you would look away if you saw him
pausing a moment among the gardens
and the horses, listening to the song
of each thing, the common things he had forgotten.
Think of him hearing your voice again,
hiding his face in his hands
as he listened, hearing a music
of losses and joys, pestilence
and bounty, a beauty that had prepared
a place for him. And whether you would have him
be changed by that, or return
to what he was, or become
what he had come this way to become."
Mahler in New York,"Now when I go out, the wind pulls me
into the grave. I go out
to part the hair of a child I left behind,
and he pushes his face into my cuffs, to smell the wind.
If I carry my father with me, it is the way
a horse carries autumn in its mane.
If I remember my brother,
it is as if a buck had knelt down
in a room I was in.
I kneel, and the wind kneels down in me.
What is it to have a history, a flock
buried in the blindness of winter?
Try crawling with two violins
into the hallway of your father’s hearse.
It is filled with sparrows.
Sometimes I go to the field
and the field is bare. There is the wind,
which entrusts me;
there is a woman walking with a pail of milk,
a man who tilts his bread in the sun;
there is the black heart of a mare
in the milk—or is it the wind, the way it goes?
I don’t know about the wind, about the way
it goes. All I know is that sometimes
someone will pick up the black violin of his childhood
and start playing—that it sits there on his shoulder
like a thin gray falcon asleep in its blinders,
and that we carry each other this way
because it is the way we would like to be carried:
sometimes with mercy, sometimes without.
 "
The Biology of Random Intention,"I frowned over the soft zodiac of brown wrinkles
attempting to squint clarity
into my palm’s cracked plate
as if it might be a map to someplace
important. I, too, wanted to disappear
into others but was disappointingly singular.
Brandishing an encyclopedia,
I was stunned to learn along our personal
milky way that there were names for every pleat
& channel, every mount of flesh.
Fate line. Sun line. Money line.
Heart line. Head line. Life line.
My life line looked past repair
A coaxial cable snipped, frayed.
Since my quilted palm was my mother’s responsibility,
I asked her what these alien letters meant.
Every origami starts with a valley or mountain fold,
she said. Yours is the mountain. Yours is a life of work.
Your hand, she said, takes the shape
of the last thing spirit reaches for in its last darkness."
Open Letter to Henry,"It is so strange,
the photograph
I was given of you,
because the man in it
is me
and not me.
It is me
in costume
it is me at a distance
squinted into focus.
Everything
I do not know
about myself
has been buried
with you.
As I
settle
into a man
I do not know
I’ve become
a mystery
to myself.
How many times
have I laughed
coughed
whispered
heard
your voice
echoing through me.
How many times
have I missed you
waving back at me
from behind
every mirror
while I
shaved
washed my hands
cut my hair.
How many times
have you touched me
with my own hand.
My inheritance
probably lies
in habits
that annoy me the most.
The sound
I make
clearing my throat
the broad toss
of my chest
when I walk
or the desolate
silence
we shared in our heads
in our empty rooms
in our isolated youth.
How many times
have we been
so alone
we overlooked
one another
standing
as close
as any man
can
to his own
shadow."
Road to Revival,"For Dr. Maya Angelou
Illuminated triangle crowned by the sun

Don’t confuse poison for sugar on this road
Get lost just to be saved on this road
Dance for your testimony on this road
Be On The Battlefield on this road
                             Use this path to step into your greatness
Be casually brave on this road
Stay fierce in your faith on this road
Tell the truth till Glory Hallelujah on this road
Step into your courage
Bolster your spirit
Know your Divinity
On the tongue that lifts faith above chaos
On the hands that built cradles when caskets were requested
On the pyramids, on the pyres, on the pulse of this new day
Know your Divinity
In the sanctuaries
In the sickrooms
In the gardens
               In the office of politics
               On the borders, in the matrix
Know your Divinity
               In the bordellos with backroom nurseries
               In the family reunions behind every prison wall
Know your elegance
Know your voice
Know your heart is not meant for storage
Know if they call for rifles someone must still bring bread
Know that last night something was said
And right at that moment, a man         a woman         was healed

Between silk and steel conjoined above the fire
Between the tongue’s knife and the lover’s caress

The feathery touch of love on this road
The rituals on this road
The forgiveness on this road
Praise the Spirituals hanging like fruit above this road

The Shadow on the Stone,"      I went by the Druid stone 
   That stands in the garden white and lone,   
And I stopped and looked at the shifting shadows   
   That at some moments there are thrown
   From the tree hard by with a rhythmic swing,   
   And they shaped in my imagining
To the shade that a well-known head and shoulders   
   Threw there when she was gardening.
      I thought her behind my back,
   Yea, her I long had learned to lack,
And I said: “I am sure you are standing behind me,   
   Though how do you get into this old track?”
   And there was no sound but the fall of a leaf   
   As a sad response; and to keep down grief
I would not turn my head to discover
   That there was nothing in my belief.
      Yet I wanted to look and see
   That nobody stood at the back of me;
But I thought once more: “Nay, I’ll not unvision   
   A shape which, somehow, there may be.”
   So I went on softly from the glade,
   And left her behind me throwing her shade,   
As she were indeed an apparition—
   My head unturned lest my dream should fade."
For everyone who tried on the slipper before Cinderella,"after Anis Mojgani and Audre Lorde
For those making tea in the soft light of Saturday morning
in the peaceful kitchen
in the cool house
For those with shrunken hearts still trying to love
For those with large hearts trying to forget
For those with terrors they cannot name
upset stomachs and too tight pants
For those who get cut off in traffic
For those who spend all day making an elaborate meal
that turns out mediocre
For those who could not leave
even when they knew they had to
For those who never win the lottery
or become famous
For those getting groceries on Friday nights
There is something you know
about living
that you guard with your life
your one fragile, wonderful life
wonder, as in, awe,
as in, I had no idea I would be here now.
For those who make plans and those who don’t
For those driving across the country to a highway that knows them
For the routes we take in the dark, trusting
For the roads for the woods for the dead humming in prayer
For an old record and a strong sun
For teeth bared to the wind
a pulse in the chest
a body making love to itself
There is every reason to hate it here
There is a list of things making it bearable:
your friend’s shoulder Texas barbecue a new book
a loud song a strong song a highway that knows you
sweet tea an orange cat a helping hand
an unforgettable dinner
a laugh that escapes you and deflates you
like a pink balloon left soft with room
for goodness to take hold
For those who have looked in the mirror and begged
For those with weak knees and an attitude
For those called “sensitive” or “too much”
For those not called enough
For the times you needed and went without
For the photo of you as a child
quietly icing cupcakes your hair a crackling thunderstorm
Love is coming.
It’s on its way.
Look—"
My Life Is a Memory,"translated from the Spanish by William George Williams
When I met her I loved myself.
It was she who had my best singing,
she who set flame to my obscure youth,
she who raised my eyes toward heaven.
Her love moistened me, it was an essence.
I folded my heart like a handkerchief 
and after I turned the key on my existence.
And thus it perfumes my soul
with a distant and subtle poetry.
    Mi vida es un recuerdo 
  Cuando la conocí me amé á mí mismo.
Fué la que tuvo mi mejor lirismo,
la que encendió mi obscura adolescencia,
la que mis ojos levantó hacia el cielo.
     Me humedeció su amor, que era una esencia,
doblé mi corazón como un pañuelo
y después le eché llave á mi existencia.

     Y por eso perfuma el alma mía
con lejana y diluida poesía."
"A Blind Spot, Awash","And if I give up on consequences 
is that despair  
or passion? I can’t protect  
myself from either. The lantern swinging  
bearing down, pressing the dark  
to a sliver  
of shade at the edges of my field  
of vision. My body alight in  
the seat of this question and indecisive— 
if to be moved through,
                         de-throated,  
the groove in the thoroughfare.
I felt reduced waking up 
crumpled by the water, an amniotic curve 
along the shore. My only shape
was having been carried,
left at rest. And everything
I thought I could lose—
when I followed the rushes back, resurfaced.
Wings tucked just so or grasses threaded 
gently from ear to ear, rewiring their small 
skulls. I understood the first mercy  
             of diving is blindness, those parachutes blooming
                        the drag that yanked me back 
to my body, almost touching my lungs."

The Lost Bird,"translated from the Spanish by William Cullen Bryant
          My bird has flown away,
Far out of sight has flown, I know not where.
          Look in your lawn, I pray,
          Ye maidens, kind and fair,
And see if my beloved bird be there.
          His eyes are full of light;
The eagle of the rock has such an eye;
          And plumes, exceeding bright,
          Round his smooth temples lie,
And sweet his voice and tender as a sigh.
          Look where the grass is gay
With summer blossoms, haply there he cowers;
          And search, from spray to spray,
          The leafy laurel-bowers,
For well he loves the laurels and the flowers.
          Find him, but do not dwell,
With eyes too fond, on the fair form you see,
          Nor love his song too well;
          Send him, at once, to me,
Or leave him to the air and liberty.
          For only from my hand
He takes the seed into his golden beak,
          And all unwiped shall stand
          The tears that wet my cheek,
Till I have found the wanderer I seek.
          My sight is darkened o’er,
Whene’er I miss his eyes, which are my day,
          And when I hear no more
          The music of his lay,
My heart in utter sadness faints away.
    El pájaro perdido 
     ¡Huyó con vuelo incierto,
Y de mis ojos ha desparecido! . . .
¡Mirad si a vuestro huerto
Mi pájaro querido,
Niñas hermosas, por acaso ha huido!
   Sus ojos relucientes
Son como los del águila orgullosa;
Plumas resplandecientes
En la cabeza airosa
Lleva, y su voz es tierna y armoniosa.
   Mirad si cuidadoso
Junto a las flores se escondió en la grama:
Ese laurel frondoso
Mirad rama por rama,
Que él los laureles y las flores ama.
   Si le halláis por ventura,
No os enamore su amoroso acento;
No os prende su hermosura:
Volvédmele al momento,
O dejadle, si no, libre en el viento.
   Porque su pico de oro
Sólo en mi mano toma la semilla,
Y no enjugaré el lloro
Que veis en mi mejilla
Hasta encontrar mi prófuga avecilla.
   Mi vista se oscurece
Si sus ojos no ve, que son mi día;
Mi ánima desfallece
Con la melancolía
De no escucharle ya su melodía."

"Barnes & Noble, 1999","I was a boy in a bookstore, “a bathhouse,” I’ll joke
when I am older. But then, I wasn’t. I was in a gallery
of things to be cracked open; all their spines & mine.
I tell you, I was a hungry pickpocket, plucking
what language I could from books & men who stood hard
before me. This is what it means to be astonishing;
to thieve speech and sense from the undeserving.
I tell you, I was a boy and they were men, so all
the words I know for this I made into small razors,
some tucked between my teeth, under my tongue,
and when they said what a good mouth I had,
I smiled, the silver glint of sharp things in me
singing, “I’ll outlive you. I’ll outlive all of you.”"
"Residence, Laramie, Wyoming","If we think of time as a bolt

cotton that begins its immediate slow
fray, then for a moment you were
the newest well-built thing in the world:
the perfect angle of your peaked roof,
unwarped frames of your windows,
glass so clear it almost isn’t there.
Then those who planned you hanged
white curtains, arranged the furniture—
the kitchen table with its smooth
wood legs, the brown leather loveseat
against a dustless living room wall.
The closets grew gray suits, a patterned
morning dress with sunflowers, the yellow
still brilliantine and deep twenty years
before it faded to unripe lemon rind.
And the bassinet in the nursery upstairs
a room whose walls they papered
with cartooned race cars. As the body does,

puts away his brush, canvas filled with another
well-made thing, the house you grew up in
with its green lawn and shrubs spreading
forever out of the frame, no one knows but he
how they will beat you and string you up
like a painting on a cattle fence outside Laramie.
No one knows you will not live. No one knows
how many will say it could have been me."
[Tet],"ט
There’s nothing the plague dead did that we
didn’t do. We gave our unprotected bodies
to strangers too—before we met & burned
each other’s initials into our arms. Black ink
& ash smudge, foreheads anointed the day
of fasting. Neither of us knows why
he deserved to survive, the virus
a hummingbird hovering above
the flower’s stamen before gliding off
to another bloom. On Granville Island
I, ghost, took you, ghost, to be my lawful—
my body still craving to be broken into
like a window; yours the rock that smashes."

This page once was blank, once was pulp,
once was tree. Someone dips a pen
in the inkwell and the letter appears.
                                   Pictograph of an eye,
a skull, which should be bleached white
but now is black. Its curved horns point
the way to the Pacific cliffs toward the sea.
What has a beginning must have an end,
            you’d think. Draw a line
from here across the ocean—it would stop
at the isle of the dead. Shapes slink toward us
through a pinkish, clinging fog. A silent letter
begins our names, unpronounceable
but for a glottal grunt. I tell you the ancient
stories—Jonathan and David, Achilles and Patroclus.
Men like us have always been here. If you separate
the right glyph from the left, if you
                                    deconstruct the letter,
the world almost ends. Once this page was blank
but now is not. Text me a photo of your left hand,
                                    my gold band
circling your finger with half of infinity’s ring.
 "
The Subjunctive,"Had my brother and I not planted
the pine saplings we brought home
from school forty years ago,
had we not watered them and spread
fertilizer around the roots, the yard
of the house we grew up in would not
have smothered under a blanket of cracked
and fallow needles. Were it not for their
height, their naïve placement beneath
the power lines, too near the neighbor’s
fences, his widow would not have had them
cut to stumps, their irregular rings
bared and countable. I wish they were
not—then would I not return there
almost every winter looking for what
once was, a bright future coming
toward us, we thought, to bathe us
in its light like water, not sever us
with its lightning like a chainsaw.

 "
Self-Portrait as the Chosen One,"Long before I was what I am now, short
of breath, bald, just returned with arthritic knees
from exile in another country’s muck and red
volcanic soil, too near-sighted to discern
the High Plains tumbleweed from the burning
bush of myth, scorched now and silent,
long before this, I was the first son my mother
bore that lived. The first two were named,
baptized as they strangled blue and cold
in the stillborn canal. Incorruptible halo
of hospital lights. But not me—I got dragged
through by the forceps in time to cut the cord,
unwind the noose of flesh from my pulsing neck.
I can’t be sure when she first told me this
story, this incantation, why they adopted
my brother before I was born. Maybe I was
five or six. But I heard it so many times it swelled
below my skin, a cyst adherent to bone.
We were walking on an unweeded path at the edge
of some woods a few blocks from the house,
the trees razed later for condos, a strip mall.
You’re a miracle, she said. You’ll do great things.
But I haven’t. I remember the September grass
wilting, the dead leaves’ veins crunching underfoot.
From that day I’ve been lost, wandering
through a field of flawed memories and missed
signposts. What she should have said is
you will learn even your skin is a borrowed mask.
 "
To Edison,"translated from the Spanish by Agnes Blake Poor
In thee, the spirit of thy native soil
    Draws breath and stirs with potent fruitful life.
Thou, from the field of elemental strife,
    Seizest the guerdon of thy noble toil.
Franklin before, along the slender coil
    Called down the fiery sparks in heaven rife.
Traced the quick ray, like sharp dividing knife;
    And to the earth brought down the lightning’s spoil.
And thou, the living glory of thy race,
    Preservest for all time the spoken word;
Defying ignorance’s numbing trace;
    Despising falsehood’s deadly withering breath.
The immortal tree of life thy hand conferred,
    Even on the edge of the abyss of death."
"Lord, I Ask a Garden . . .","translated from the Spanish by William George Williams
Lord, I ask a garden in a quiet spot
where there may be a brook with a good flow,
an humble little house covered with bell-flowers,
and a wife and a son who shall resemble Thee.
I should wish to live many years, free from hates,
and make my verses, as the rivers
that moisten the earth, fresh and pure.
Lord, give me a path with trees and birds.
I wish that you would never take my mother,
for I should wish to tend to her as a child
and put her to sleep with kisses, when somewhat old
she may need the sun.
I wish to sleep well, to have a few books,
an affectionate dog that will spring upon my knees,
a flock of goats, all things rustic,
and to live off the soil tilled by my own hand.
To go into the field and flourish with it;
to seat myself at evening under the rustic eaves,
to drink in the fresh mountain perfumed air
and speak to my little one of humble things.
At night to relate him some simple tale,
teach him to laugh with the laughter of water
and put him to sleep thinking that he may later on
keep that freshness of the moist grass.
And afterward, the next day, rise with dawn
admiring life, bathe in the brook,
milk my goats in the happiness of the garden
and add a strophe to the poem of the world.
    Señor, yo pido un huerto 
  Señor, yo pido un huerto en un rincón tranquilo
donde haya una quebrada con aguas abundantes
una casita humilde cubierta de campánulas,
y una mujer y un hijo que sean como Vos.
Yo quisiera vivir muchos años, sin odios,
y hacer como los ríos que humedecen la tierra
mis versos y mis actos frescos y de puros.
Señor, dadme un sendero con árboles y pájaros.
Yo deseo que nunca os llevéis a mi madre,
porque a mi me gustara cuidarla cual a un niño
y dormirla con besos, cuando ya viejecita 
necesite del sol.
Quiero tener buen sueño, algunos pocos libros
un perro cariñoso que me salte a las piernas,
un rebaño de cabras, toda cosa silvestre,
y vivir de la tierra labrada por mis manos.
Salir a la campiña, y florecer en ella;
sentarme por la tarde, bajo el rústico alero,
a beber aire fresco y olorosa a montaña,
y hablarle a mi pequeño de las cosas humildes
Por la noche contarle algún cuento sencillo,
enseñarle a reír con la risa del agua
y dormirle pensando en que pueda, a la tarde,
guardar esa frescura de la hierba embebida;
y luego, al otro día, levantarme a la aurora
admirando la vida, bañarme en la quebrada,
ordeñar a mis cabras en la dicha del huerto,
y agregar una estrofa al poema del mundo."

Homage to Darío,"translated from the Spanish by Agnes Blake Poor
Sadly mourns the fair princess, while her golden bees,
Clustering together in the stillness of the sun,
Murmur faintly like the waves of enchanted seas.
Knight and Squire around her are striving, every one,
Vainly striving to awake on her cheek the blush,
Soft as on an evening cloud the last sunset flush.
Sadly mourns the centaur troop from the classic lands,
Suddenly arrested on some distant shore,
By the cadence of the waves, like a funeral band,
Till they cover all the marge, and are heard no more.
Till the last faint ripple, with a sobbing breath,
Dies away in silence, and all is still as death.
Sacred swans of poesy, snow-white and snow-soft,
Floating heaps of slumber on waveless lakes afar;
Royal train of peacocks, with crested heads aloft,
Such as pace majestic, linked to Juno’s car.
Or in Versailles gardens step slowly one by one,
Past the steps of Pompadour’s rose-heaped, rose-hung throne.
Floating vapors slowly rise and wreathe, wind-swept and pale;
Hiding arching necks of snow, shining crests of blue;
Sad and sweet the murmurs through the misty veil,
Till the poet’s song resounds, the flowerless desert through;
And but for a moment rings the Sonatina’s lay,
Roaring winds and thunder peals sweep it far away.
                  *      *      *      *      *      *
The spectral Archer of the Northern sky,
Bends his great bow across the sphere on high;
Through the unmeasured realms of night and day,
Speeds his black arrow on its destined way.
It strikes, but pierces not, the poet’s breast,
His empty quiver near him lies at rest,
And over him sinks slowly in the West
            The Archer Boy.
Let no loud weeping chill the budding bloom,
That elves and nymphs have wreathed about his tomb,
The gentle Syrinx mourns his shortened years,
And on his laurels Pan sheds quiet tears;
In the cathedral raise the exile’s Psalm,
That through the transepts breathes like sorrow’s balm,
And in the tinted window rises calm
            The Archer Boy
And now the band of those who loved him best
Follows him slowly to his place of rest.
To the slow beating of the muffled drum
With heads bowed down and measured tread they come.
Pale and serene, fixed in triumphant peace,
His noble face bids lamentation cease,
His only fitting requiem shall be
The pealing Psalm that tells of victory.
The blazoned banners float above his bier,
And from blue far-off waters rises clear
            The swan-song on the ear!"
The Art of Shooting in the Dark,"after Pedro Pietri
We were      nocturnal players, 
Bats in ball,      & ever since Don Pedro said 
There are Puerto Ricans      on the moon 
The night is      my cousin      & the clustered stars 
My cousin      & Saturn’s little ring of smoke      my second cousin 
Though not the same ring      as a freshly snapped Medalla bottle      which
My abuelo      also named Pedro      apparently liked too much 
But back to the moon      the first rock      dollop of sugar  
& slinging hoop in the dark      which we learned was a game
      of approximation
Less math      more muscle memory      less Mozart      more Machito 
Like descarga      more riff      more wrist. 
We set our eyes      on not seeing      but feeling a thing through, indeed
From elbow to hip      wherever the orange lip might lead"
By the Sea,"translated from the Spanish by Muna Lee
I embraced her fifteen years,
    And kissed, as I drew to me,
The flower-like face, the chestnut hair,
    Beside a singing sea.
“Think of me, never forget—
    No matter how far I may be!”
And I saw a shooting star
    Fall suddenly into the sea."
Escape,"translated from the Spanish by Muna Lee
The dungeon crushes me—over my restless spirit
    Pass dark thoughts unspoken.
My poet’s wings, even in unfolding,
    Against four walls are broken.
Entombed and alive! The nights are eternal,
    And eternal are the days.
Sorrows companion me, spies are about me,
    The fetter upon me weighs.
But on closing my eyes—(light, sky, and meadow!)—
    Broken I see my chain.
With my love on my arm I breathe deep in the garden
    Of magnolia and vervain.
I delight in the air, in the running water,
    Fresh as my belovèd one.
There is still something good despots cannot imprison,
    Nor heap chains upon!"
Mist,"translated from the Spanish by Roderick Gill
O faint remembrances of vanished days
    That stole away on such a velvet wing
O’er meads and groves, o’er plains and mountain ways,
    What grief and sorrow to my heart you bring!
Come back without the shadow of your care,
    Come back in silence and without a moan,
As the birds cross the unregarding air
    Till none may tell the whence or whither flown.
Come back amid the pallor of the moon
    That silvers all the azure rifts at sea,
Or in the deadly mist that in a swoon
    Engulfs afar the green palm’s royal tree.
Bring back the murmur of the doves that made
    Their little nests so neighborly to mine;
The vibrant airs––the fragrances that played
     Around the peaks that saw my cradle shine.
Sing in my ear the melodies of old,
    So sweet and joyous to my inmost heart;
O faint remembrances two breasts should hold,
    Two breasts that Destiny was loath to part!
What matter if a sigh steals through the dream
    That shows the withered vine in flower again?––
So that remembrances in singing seem,
    O tremulous lyre, to speak my endless pain!"
Canción,"translated by Peter Anthony Motteux
What makes me languish and complain?––Oh, ’tis disdain!
What yet more fiercely tortures me?––’Tis jealousy.
How have I patience lost?––By absence crossed.
Then hopes farewell, there’s no relief;
I sink beneath oppressing grief;
Nor can a wretch, without despair,
Scorn, jealousy, and absence bear.
What in my breast, this anguish drove?––Intruding love.
What could such mighty ills create?––Blind fortune’s hate.
What cruel powers my fate approve?––The powers above.
Then let me bear and cease to moan;
’Tis glorious thus to be undone;
When these invade, who dares oppose?
Heaven, love, and fortune are my foes. What shall I find a speedy cure?––Death is sure.
No milder means to set me free?––Inconstancy.
Can nothing else my pains assuage?––Distracting age.
What! die or change? ––Lucinda lose?––
Oh, let me rather madness choose!
But judge, ye gods, what we endure
When death or madness is the cure!"
Let Me Go Warm,"translated by H. W. Longfellow
Let me go warm and merry still;
And let the world laugh, an’ it will.
Let other muse on earthly things,––
The fall of thrones, the fate of kings,
     And those whose fame the world doth fill;
Whilst muffins sit enthroned in trays
And orange-punch in winter sways
The merry scepter of my days;––
     And let the world laugh, an’ it will.
He that the royal purple wears,
From golden plate a thousand cares
     Doth swallow as a gilded pill;
On feasts like these I turn my back,
Whilst puddings in my roasting-jack
Beside the chimney hiss and crack;––
     And let the world laugh, an’ it will.
And when the wintry tempest blows,
And January’s sleets and snows
     Are spread o’er every vale and hill,
With one to tell a merry tale
O’er roasted nuts and humming ale,
I sit, and care not for the gale;––
     And let the world laugh, an’ it will.
Let merchants traverse seas and lands
For silver mines and golden sands;
     Whilst I beside some shadowry rill
Just where its bubbling fountain swells
Do sit and gather stones and shells,
And hear the tale the blackbird tells;––
     And let the world laugh, an’ it will.
For Hero’s sake the Grecian lover
The stormy Hellespont swam over;
     I cross without the fear of ill
The wooden bridge that slow bestrides
The madrigal’s enchanting sides,
Or barefoot wade through Yepe’s tides;––
     And let the world laugh, an’ it will.
But since the Fates so cruel prove,
That Pyramus should die of love,
     And love should gentle Thisbe kill;
My Thisbe be an apple-tart,
The sword I plunge into her heart
The tooth that bites the crust apart,––
     And let the world laugh, an’ it will."

"“Stop. Go put your shoes back on. They’ll know we Okies,” a Lost Image Reclamation",
Verses to the Moon,"translated from the Spanish by William George Williams
Oh moon, who now look over the roof
of the church, in the tropical calm
to be saluted by him who has been out all night,
to be barked at by the dogs of the suburbs,
Oh moon who in your silence have laughed at
all things! In your sidereal silence 
when, keeping carefully in the shadow, the
municipal judge steals from some den.
But you offer, saturnine traveler,
with what eloquence in mute space
consolation to him whose life is broken,
while there sing to you from a drunken brawl
long-haired, neurasthenic bards,
and lousy creatures who play dominos.
    Versos a la luna 
  ¡Oh, luna, que hoy te asomas al tejado
de la iglesia, en la calma tropical,
para que te salude un trasnochado
y te ladren los perros de arrabal!
¡Oh, luna! . . . ¡En tu silencio te has burlado
de todo! . . . En tu silencio sideral,
viste anoche robar en despoblado
. . . ¡y el ladrón era un Juez municipal!
Mas tú ofreces, viajera saturnina,
con qué elocuencia en los espacios mudos,
consuelo al que la vida laceró,
mientras te cantan, en cualquier cantina,
neurasténicos bardos melenudos
y piojosos, que juegan dominó. . ."
I Know Not,"Holy God, where are You—Whom I fail to find
Although laboriously I probe and search?
Wrapt in a dense obscurity, I am blind;
And when I pray, I enter in the church.
Doubts in the centre of my spirit dwell
Whose harsh accent my bitter grief revives.
The mollusk is happier far than man; the shell
Oppresses it—and yet within it lives.
Yet life I dare not shorten, since I see—
Mute, sad, mysterious—the narrow grave,
And the certain riddle with a hidden key.
Shadows behind, before me—all about me.
Everywhere shadows, within me and without me—
Even in Your temple with its shadowy nave!"
Intimate Prayer,"Blessed forever be 
My hamlet in its simplicity 
With its mornings calm and bright, 
Lilac-covered, or blue or white. 
Where evening as a perfume goes, 
And twilight’s colored like a rose. 
With nights whose beauty nothing mars, 
Drunken with the moon and stars. 
Where the ancient steeple airy
Watches like a visionary. 
With tiny houses that beguile
One’s spirit with their humble smile. 
Where ancient laurels touch the sky, 
And from tall cotes the pigeons fly. 
Where the rivulet and river
Bathe the feet of the village ever. 
Where blossomy branches are the yield
Of the fertile fragrant field. 
With hearts good and happy, making 
Life’s old hurt leave off its aching—
Hearts that crave no other’s pleasure,
But the days by duties measure; 
Child-like souls who seem to be 
All courtesy and gravity. 
For this, and for much more that I 
From memory will not let die, 
Blessed forever be
My hamlet in its simplicity! "
When the Neighbor Boys Gathered,"         It seemed all their faces grew
sticky as they watched. Fruit flies stuck to their chins.
Like any soft boy, I am constantly reminded 
         of how much better I look
inside-out. It was in Kevin’s backyard 
         where I learned how to swallow
         a boot or two.
         This was the birthplace of my knees,
new cells coating the gravel, red lesions 
         like fat worms along my legs.
I didn’t always hate them—the boys I mean. 
It was the closest I’ve come to baptism.
Head locked against his naked torso. His sour sweat 
burning my eyes shut. That restless timbre
growing in my head, as I pursed my lips and pressed 
         my face into his ribs, left a trail of saliva
along his bare skin. Muscles withered
         and dried out as he pushed me away, disgusted
         at how hard my pulse had become 
in his arms. This is how the summer opened
its wet mouth, how it wrung the blood 
                         from a body and rebuilt it
                                                    from the mud.
 "
The Story,"My mother opens my bedroom
door and gags on the overwhelming scent
of urine, like something died, she says, 
in the story that follows me
to every family gathering,
a hound locked on the scent
of a wandering child. It was a phase
my mother said lasted until I was fourteen,
or around the time I started doing my own laundry. 
She goes on to tell them about the piles of wet
clothes hidden in the back of my closet, 
like something died—again
we all know this story,
a boy gets touched and then ruins
the upholstery, or a boy rubs himself 
in the back of the school bus
until his jeans become a shade darker.
I never told my mother I was molested,
never told her that story, the one 
where a boy finds a tongue,
ten years later, fermenting 
in a jar. I never told her
how someone reached inside me 
and turned on all the faucets.
 "
I Want Nothing,"to do with my mother’s
sadness, her mouth:
a pockmark on every door
that opens onto a memorial scene, 
her mouth: the beginning
of traffic. Odd to think
of it as an ugly and frequent
song on the radio,
a small bird shitting
and dying in my hands.
He is dead, she says,
over and over again,
except in Vietnamese,
which to me doesn’t sound
as tragic—a little uglier,
maybe, but less tragic,
for sure. The house phone
on her lap sings its dead
hum into the static air
of our living room. Who?
Who? I ask. I shake her
shoulders, Who?
When she finally looks
at me through the slit
of her black bangs,
she tells me about the man
she would have married
if she stayed in Vietnam,
and my posture straightens,
and my eyes roll, and I am 
relieved at the absence
of my own grief, and I hate him, 
this man, this dead man
that won’t stay gone
now that he’s gone
for good, now that he has built
this house of meat to rot
and stew on the sunniest days, 
now that he fills the marrow
in each bone of my mother’s regret. 
When she thinks of love 
either she’s a widow or divorced, 
and I believed for a while
that regret is leaving
the burning house 
empty-handed, but he is
already ash, and I tell her
she made the right choice, 
which is funny, cause I hate
my father, and often forget
that he’s still alive.
 "
The Dock,"No one wants to go near the lake 
that swallowed two more boys
this year. Sad story, yes, but we’re thankful 
to have a pretty place to be discreet.
Not saying a basement can’t be pretty, 
and don’t get me wrong, I am a fan
of the mass-produced hotel art,
the same photo hanging above each bed
makes it easier to pretend each new room 
is still our room, makes me crave a life
of dull decor and basic cable, makes my mouth 
water, really. I bite the lips off of a Styrofoam cup
and spit them at the ducks that swim past.
Wait. Don’t eat that. Fuck.
This is the first time I hear him laugh out loud. 
With him, there are few noises I can recognize.
A fly lands on his cheek and I try to brush it 
away, but before my hand can cast
a shadow on the bridge of his nose,
the fly burrows into him. He doesn’t flinch,
just winks—and now there’s one on his knee, 
and another lands in his dimple, one on each
eyelid. There are hundreds now, all digging 
or moving underneath his skin, all bubbling
behind that firm smile. His eyes begin
to vibrate, and he doesn’t reach for me. He doesn’t
need me here, really. I am no expert, or exorcist, 
or great love. I am just another boy sitting
an arm’s length away from someone he doesn't recognize 
in the light. He opens his mouth and they all fly out,
not a swarm, but a single-file line, a thin braid of black
hair, the longest exhale from a sinking car—That’s it.
There. That’s the noise I’m so familiar with."
Nocturne,"One night, 
One night filled with murmurs and perfumes and the music of wings, 
One night
When fantastic fireflies blazed in the moist nuptial shadows, 
By my side slowly, clasped to me, pale and silent, 
As if a presentiment of infinite bitterness
Agitated the most secret depths of your heart,
Over the blossomy path through the meadow
You wandered; 
And the full moon
Scattered white light over bluish skies, boundless and deep. 
And your shadow, 
Frail and languid,
And my shadow
By the rays of the moon projected 
Over the gloomy sand, 
Joined together 
And were one,
And were one, 
And were one, 
And were one long shadow, 
And were one long shadow, 
And were one long shadow. . . . 
Tonight 
Along—my soul
Filled with infinite bitterness and pain of your death, 
Separated from you by time and space and the tomb, 
By the black infinity
Whither the voice cannot reach: 
Silent and alone
I wandered along the path, 
And I heard the dogs baying the moon, 
The pallid moon, 
And the chirrup of frogs. . . . 
I was cold, with the cold of your cheek and your brow and your beloved hands 
Among the white snows of your shroud: 
It was the cold of the sepulchre, the ice of death, 
The chill of nothingness. . . . 
And my shadow, 
By the rays of the moon projected, 
Went alone, 
Went alone, 
Went alone over the lonely plain. 
And your shadow quick and slender, 
Frail and languid, 
As in that warm night of vanished spring, 
As in that night filled murmurs and perfumes and the music of wings, 
Came close and walked with mine, 
Came close and walked with mine, 
Came close and walked with mine, 
Oh, the shadows knit together! 
Oh, the shadows of the body joined with shadows of the soul! 
Oh, shadows which seek one another in nights of sorrow and tears! "
The Fugitive,"Fair vision, undefined and fleeting, 
Whose light foot hardly prints the lawn; 
Now here, now there, my charmed gaze meeting
To be more quickly yet withdrawn. 
A shadow flitting through the wicket, 
A sunny flash upon the air 
Where just behind the lilac thicket
I catch a gleam of golden hair. 
And starting at the passing splendor, 
I lose it like a shooting star. 
One dazzled glance alone I send her, 
Before she vanishes afar. 
Her silver laugh rings musically 
Along the garden’s winding ways;
I hasten down the shady alley, 
Where her white dress flits from my gaze. 
I pour my soul, lest she be near me, 
In some old song, beloved of time; 
But only echo deigns to hear me, 
And chill me with her mocking chime. 
The dream is o’er, I wait in vain; 
But will she never come again? "
Boy,"My mother’s favorite story, a dull one, of course— 
            is that she did not scream during my birth, 
instead dug her nails into her sister’s wrist, severing
            a vein, and killing her—I’m only joking. 
She lived. I did say this was her favorite story after all.
                          :::
               They say if the mother is silent
               during birth, then the child will grow
               up without the ability to smell or decipher 
               maps, but will indeed grow up.
               They say if the baby is born silent, 
               then it’s probably a faggot, or dead, 
               or will be eventually.
                          :::
He was a stupid child. Ate dirt they said. Ate glass 
and people’s wallets. Kept a farm of cigarette butts 
in his cheeks. Smelled like a highway,
but sounded like a boy.
Stood on the overpass and swore 
he could hear her screaming.
 "
The Hurricane,"Translated by William Cullen Bryant
Lord of the winds! I feel thee nigh;
I know thy breath in the burning sky!
And I wait with a thrill in every vein,
For the coming of the hurricane!
And lo! on the wings of the heavy gales,
Through the boundless arch of heaven he sails;
Silent and slow and terribly strong,
The mighty shadow is borne along,
Like the dark eternity to come;
While the world below, dismayed and dumb,
Through the calm of the thick hot atmosphere
Looks up at its gloomy folds with fear.
They darken fast—, and the golden blaze
Of the sun is quenched in the lurid haze,
And he sends through the shade a funeral ray,
A glare that is neither night nor day,
A beam that touches, with hues of death,
The clouds above and the earth beneath.
To its covert glides the silent bird,
While the hurricane’s distant voice is heard
Uplifted among the mountains round,
And the forests hear and answer the sound.
He is come! he is come! do ye not behold
His ample robes on the wind unrolled?
Giant of air! we bid thee hail.
How his gray skirts toss in the whirling gale;
How his huge and writhing arms are bent
To clasp the zone of firmament,
And fold, at length, in their dark embrace
From mountain to mountain the visible space.
Darker—still darker! the whirlwinds bear
The dust of the plains to the middle air;
And hark to the crashing, long and loud,
Of the chariot of God in the thunder cloud!
You may trace its path by the flashes that start
From the rapid wheels where’er they dart.
And the fire-bolts leap to the world below,
And flood the skies with a lurid glow.
What roar is that? ’tis the rain that breaks
In torrents away from the airy lakes,
Heavily poured on the shuddering ground,
And shedding a nameless horror around.
Ah! well known woods and mountains and skies,
With the very clouds! Ye are lost to my eyes.
I seek you vainly and see in your place
The shadowy tempest that sweeps through space,
A whirling ocean that fills the wall
Of the crystal heavens, and buries all.
And I, cut off from the world, remain
Alone with the terrible hurricane."
Near the Shrine of Saint Naum,"translated from the Arabic by Kareem James Abu-Zeid
I stood in the red church,
its tiny domes like buds
blossoming in stone,
I stood near the saint’s resting place
while a tourist laid her cheek on the tombstone
to hear his beating heart.
But I was no tourist,
and the saint left the room with me,
and the church the builders wrote in his memory
was nothing more
than a passing dream in his eternal sleep.
The tourists come in vain,
as do the believers.

What Now,"The roads have closed for flooding. 
The rows of cars are marbled in a mist. 
Watching gulls dive-bomb

that’s left for me is gratitude. 
Thank you for this. 
Thank you for the landscape
that’s not yet turned to dust, 
the wet gusts filled with clumsy birds 
and hints of sunlight,
and me, soaking wet as well, 
allowed by the grace
of what flesh
to watch."

Abraham Lincoln Turns to Listen to the Lower Ninth,"Unsteady aquanauts,
we leave behind the capsules of our mothers’ bodies.
This is who we are,
moving along the tributaries that take us away
and back home
to the delta and the sea.
Pushing along Okwata—wide wide water
we live
Bayougoula Mougoulacha
Chitmacha Oumas 
Tangipaho Colapissa,
Quinipissa Accapissa
among the pines and cypress,
before Pontchartrain 
manacles and the deep cuts
into what we know.
Pushing through the water
inside the body of Jesus
the Lord
the Wonderer,
we huddle indecently,
resisting the foul compression
that would shame us
into that which we are not
that would turn our salty blood
into molasses
rum
cooking oil,
that would turn our bodies
into leather goods
and amusement
that would make us forget
we are water
inevitably returning to the river and the sky
always returning
baked by the sun to rising,
and falling as rain.
Pushing along the Mississippi,
Abraham Lincoln turns to see
his life and ours revolving at slow speed
shuffling into in the grand St. Louis Hotel
anywhere everywhere in New Orleans.
He watches our picked, baled and branded lives.     
Hushed by the din of trading, he watches
our lips to see what we are saying.
“They were yelling, I thought I heard yelling,” he whispers
as he watches, then
“No. Of course, not.”
Pushing against the water
so many of us leave the capsules of our mothers’ bodies
parched bloated unburied.
Spinning synchronous with the circling helicopters
we turn to gain our bearings.
Our eyes fill with the funeral water 
that cannot be left behind.
It is in our blood
it is our blood
it is in our tears
it is our tears
it is who we are now and then,
stumbling and blinded from all we have seen,
straining along the roadways that lead away
from the shelter of the delta and the sea.
Falling
falling
falling,
rain
falling into his blinking eyes."
How To Forgive,"She asks me to write a list
of all the names I’ve been called.
And then a list of things
that are killing me.
Where to start? Susie. Sue.
Big Head. Men have called me cold.
Men I know, men I don’t.
It’s all over the news
how they want to kill me.
It doesn’t matter what they
call me. When I was 17, I kneeled
on the stained carpet at Men’s Wearhouse,
looping a tape measure around
a small boy’s waist and he showed me
my name. He pulled his eyes slant
as I measured the distance
between belly button and floor: inseam
or outseam, it’s hard to keep track.
A wedding, his father said.
There was going to be a wedding.
The boy needed a tux.
I don’t like this memory
because I did nothing.
In remembering,
I become nothing again.
Not long after in college,
I was sorting clothes in the back
of a Goodwill. Court-ordered community
service. An older man took
his time looking me up
and down as I sweat through my shirt,
threw pit-stained blouses
into the discard pile,
everything else the salvaging bin.
I went home with him for years,
not knowing about the prior assaults.
Would my knowing have changed
anything? He was gentle
to my face. I only ignored
his texts sometimes.
Men have destroyed me
for less. Even the boy.
I’m supposed to tell you
I forgive him—
he was just a boy.
I forgive myself instead."
At Memphis Station,"Translated from the Danish by S. Foster Damon
Half-awake and half-dozing,
in an inward seawind of danaid dreams,
I stand and gnash my teeth
at Memphis Station, Tennessee.
It is raining.
The night is so barren, extinguished,
and the rain scourges the earth
with a dark, idiotic energy.
Everything is soggy and impassable.
Why are we held up, hour upon hour?
Why should my destiny be stopped here? 
Have I fled rain and soul-corrosion
in Denmark, India, and Japan,
to be rain-bound, to rot, in Memphis,
Tennessee, U. S. A.?
And now it dawns. Drearily light oozes
down over this damp jail.
The day uncovers mercilessly
the frigid rails and all the black mud,
the waiting-room with the slot-machine,
orange peels, cigar-and match-stumps.
The day grins through with spewing roof-gutters,
and the infinite palings of rain,
rain, say I, from heaven and to earth.
How deaf the world is, and immovable!
How banal the Creator!
And why do I go on paying dues
at this plebeian sanatorium of an existence!
Stillness. See how the engine,
the enormous machine, stands calmly and seethes;
shrouding itself in smoke, it is patient.
Light your pipe on a fasting heart,
damn God, and swallow your sorrow!
Yet go and stay in Memphis! 
Your life, after all, is nothing but
a sickening drift of rain, and your fate
was always to be belated
in some miserable waiting-room or other—
Stay in Memphis, Tennessee!
For within one of these bill-shouting houses,
happiness awaits you, happiness,
if you can only gulp down your impatience—
and here there is sleeping a buxom young girl
with one ear lost in her hair;
she will come to encounter you
some fine day on the street,
like a wave of fragrance,
looking as though she knew you.
Is it not spring?
Does the rain not fall richly?
Is there not the sound of an amorous murmur,
a long, subdued conversation of love
mouth to mouth
between the rain and the earth?
The day began so sadly,
but now, see the rainfall brighten!
Do you not allow the day its right of battle?
So now it is light. And there is a smell of mould
from between the rusted underpinning of the platform
mingled with the rain-dust’s rank breath—
a suggestion of spring—
is that no consolation?
And now see, see how the Mississippi
in its bed of flooded forest
wakes against the day!
See how the titanic river revels in its twisting!
How royally it dashes through its bends, and swings the rafts
of trees and torn planks in its whirls!
See how it twirls a huge stern-wheeler
in its deluge-arms
like a dancer, master of the floor!
See the sunken headland—oh, what immense, primeval peace
over the landscape of drowned forests!
Do you not see how the current’s dawn-waters
clothe themselves mile-broad in the day’s cheap light,
and wander healthily under the teeming clouds!
Pull yourself together, irreconcilable man!
Will you never forget that you have been promised Eternity?
Will you grudge the earth its due, your poor gratitude?
What would you do, with your heart of love?
Pull yourself together, and stay in Memphis;
announce yourself in the market as a citizen;
go in and insure yourself among the others; 
pay your premium of vulgarity,
so that they can know they are safe, as regards you,
and you will not be fired out of the club.
Court the damosel with roses and gold rings,
and begin your saw-mill, like other people.
Yank on your rubbers regularly . . .
Look about you, smoke your sapient pipe
in sphinx-deserted Memphis . . .
Ah! there comes that miserable freight-train
which has kept us waiting six hours.
It rolls in slowly—with smashed sides;
it pipes weakly; the cars limp on three wheels;
and the broken roof drips with clay and slime.
But in the tender, among the coals,
lie four still forms
covered with bloody coats.
Then our huge express-locomotive snorts;
advances a little; stops, sighing deeply;
and stands crouched for the leap. The track is clear.
And we travel onward
through the flooded forest
under the rain’s gaping sluices.
    Paa Memphis Station 
  Halvt vaagen og halvt blundende,
slaaet af en klam Virkelighed, men endnu borte
i en indre Gus af danaidiske Drømme
staar jeg og hakker Tænder
paa Memphis Station, Tennessee.
Det regner.
Natten er saa øde og udslukt,
og Regnen hudfletter Jorden
med en vidløs, dunkel Energi.
Alting er klægt og uigennemtrængeligt.
Hvorfor holder Toget her Time efter Time.
Hvorfor er min Skæbne gaaet i Staa her?
Skal jeg flygte for Regnen og Aandsfortærelsen
i Danmark, Indien og Japan
for at regne inde og raadne i Memphis,
Tennessee, U. S. A.?
Og nu dages det. Livet siver glædeløst
ind over dette vaade Fængsel.
Dagen blotter ubarmhjærtigt
de kolde Skinner og al den sorte Søle,
Ventesalen med Chokoladeavtomat,
Appelsinskaller, Cigar og Tændstikstumper,
Dagen griner igennem med spyende Tagrender
og et evigt Gitter af Regn,
Regn, siger jeg fra Himmel og til Jord.
Hvor Verden er døv og uflyttelig,
hvor Skaberen er talentløs!
Og hvorfor bliver jeg ved at betale mit Kontingent
til denne plebejiske Kneippkur af en Tilværelse!
Stille! Se hvor Maskinen,
den vældige Tingest, staar rolig og syder
og hyller sig i Røg, den er taalmodig.
Tænd Piben paa fastende Liv,
forband Gud og svælg din Smærte!
Gaa saa dog hen og bliv i Memphis!
Dit Liv er jo alligevel ikke andet
end et surt Regnvejr, og din Skæbne
var altid at hænge forsinket
i en eller anden miserabel Ventesal
Bliv i Memphis, Tennessee!
For inde i et af disse plakathujende Huse
venter Lykken dig, Lykken,
hvis blot du kan æde din Utaalmodighed
ogsaa her sover en rund ung Jomfru
med Øret begravet i sit Haar,
hun vil komme dig i Møde
en fin Dag paa Gaden
som en Bølge af Vellugt
med en Mine som om hun kendte dig.
Er det ikke Foraar?
Falder Regnen ikke frodigt?
Lyder den ikke som en forelsket Mumlen,
en lang dæmpet Kærlighedspassiar
Mund mod Mund
mellem Regnen og Jorden?
Dagen gryede saa sorgfuldt,
men se nu lyser Regnfaldet!
Under du ikke Dagen dens Kampret?
Det er dog nu lyst. Og der slaar Muldlugt
ind mellem Perronens rustne Jærnstivere
blandet med Regnstøvets ramme Aande—
En Foraarsanelse—
er det ikke trøstigt?
Og se nu, se hvor Mississippi
i sin Seng af oversvømmende Skove
vaagner mod Dagen!
Se hvor Kæmpefloden nyder sin Bugtning!
Hvor den flommer kongeligt i Bue og svinger Flaader
af Træer og laset Drivtømmer i sine Hvirvler!
Se hvor den fører en uhyre Hjuldamper
i sin Syndflodsfavn
som en Danser, der er Herre paa Gulvet!
Se de sunkne Næs—Oh hvilken urmægtig Ro
over Landskabet af druknende Skove!
Ser du ikke, hvor Strømmens Morgenvande
klæder sig milebredt med Dagens tarvelige Lys
og vandrer sundt under de svangre Skyer!
Fat dig ogsaa du, Uforsonlige!
Vil du aldrig glemme, at man lovede dig Evigheden?
Forholder du Jorden din arme Taknemlighed?
Hvad vil du da med dit Elskerhjærte?
Fat dig og bliv i Memphis,
meld dig som Borger paa Torvet,
gaa ind og livsassurer dig imellem de andre,
betal din Præmie af Lumpenhed,
at de kan vide sig sikre for sig,
og du ikke skal blive hældt ud af Foreningen.
Gør Kur til hin Jomfru med Roser og Guldring
og start et Savskæreri som andre Mennesker.
Hank rolig op i Gummistøvlerne . . .
Se dig ud, smøg din vise Pibe
I sphinxforladte Memphis . . .
Ah, der kommer det elendige Godstog,
som vi har ventet paa i seks Timer.
Det kommer langsomt ind—med knuste Sider,
det pifter svagt, Vognene lammer paa tre Hjul,
og de’ sprængte Ruf drypper af Jord og Slam.
Men paa Tenderen mellem Kullene
ligger fire stille Skikkelser
dækket af blodvaade Frakker.
Da pruster vor store Ekspresmaskine,
gaar lidt frem og stanser dybt sukkende
og staar færdig til Spring. Sporet er frit.
Og vi rejser videre
gennem de oversvømmede Skove,
under Regnens gabende Sluser."
Tomorrow,"translated by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow
Lord, what am I, that with unceasing care
   Thou did’st seek after me, that Thou did’st wait
   Wet with unhealthy dews before my gate,
And pass the gloomy nights of winter there?
Oh, strange delusion, that I did not greet
   Thy blest approach, and oh, to heaven how lost
   If my ingratitude’s unkindly frost
Has chilled the bleeding wounds upon Thy feet.
How oft my guardian angel gently cried,
   “Soul, from thy casement look, and thou shalt see
   How He persists to knock and wait for thee!”
      And oh, how often to that Voice of sorrow,
“Tomorrow we will open,” I replied,
   And when the morrow came I answered still “Tomorrow.”"
Peace,"Written in exile in Uruguay, 1838 “Deh fate un corpo sol di membri amici, Fare un capo che gli altri indirizzi e frene.” —Gerusalemme Liberata.
Protect, O Lord, our glorious heritage!
   Now by thine aid delivers from the yoke
        Of many a weary age.
   Thy never-ceasing bounty we invoke
        To make us truly free;
To guard and guide our hard-won liberty.
Let it not fade, the young and tender shoot,
   In the hot bread of faction’s withering blast;
        Let us but grasp one fruit,
   One little humble one, and hold it fast.
        We are but yet new-born;
Have we deserved the fate of States outworn?
Save us, we pray thee; the temptation spare
   That on America’s ambition waits;
      And warn us of the snare,
   That caught our sister of the silver gates,
      Fairer and proper then,
But now an outcast for the scorn of men.
Send here the pair divine, Concord and Peace,
   Daughters of Virtue, driven from the West.
      Let strife and hatred cease,
   And then our country shall be doubly blest.
      In Law's benignant shade,
Science and Art shall prosper unafraid.
Before their radiant, all-pervading light,
   Like sunrise breaking over hill and plain,
      Will fly the ghosts of night;
   Blind Superstition and Intolerance vain.
      The Faith of Freedom born,
Shall come upon the pinions of the morn.
No more the brazen trumpet’s summons wild
   Shall waken terror o’er the startled lea;
      The mother and her child
   Shall rest at eve beneath the twilight tree;
      And from the smiling fields,
The peasant gather all his labor yields.
But now the poet’s lyre exults no more;
   Sadly it answers to his failing hand.
      Yet on a foreign shore,
   Have I no prayer for thee, my native land?
      For Argentina rings
No chord of hope along its silver strings?
Speak her name tenderly, not to upbraid,
   But with the heart to pity and regret;
      And draw forgiving shade,
   Over the sins that we may not forget.
      For her there yet may be,
A resurrection day we shall not see.
Give her your prayers, sons of the happier East,
   When on the altar bounteous gifts you lay,
      On your Thanksgiving feast.
   And in return will grateful exiles pray
      “For many a coming age
Protect, O Lord, our glorious heritage!”"
Canción,"translated from the Spanish by George Ticknor
O Love, I never, never thought
    Thy power had been so great,
    That thou couldst change my fate,
By changes in another wrought,
Till now, alas! I know it.
I thought I knew thee well,
    For I had known thee long;
    But though I felt thee strong,
I felt not all thy spell.
Nor ever, ever had I thought
    Thy power had been so great,
    That thou couldst change my fate,
By changes in another wrought,
Till now, alas! I know it."

    Qui cultivent pour nous la terre americaine?
Differents de couleur, ils ont les mêmes droits;
    Vous-mêmes contres vous les armez de vos lois.
      —Delille, Malheur et Pitie, Chant I.
“And hast thou sped upon the ocean wind,
     Say, cruel pirate, hast thou come for this?
                  Not to leave one behind.
To rob my humble home of all its bliss?
     Come back and look into my cabin door
                  And find me there alone.
Their parting footsteps will return no more;
All of my own are gone, forever gone.
                  Husband and children taken
                  And only I forsaken!
O bear me after them, thou iron heart,
     And to toil with them, I will be thy slave!
                  Or if death be their part,
Cast us together in an unknown grave.
But why pray I to thee, by prayer unmoved?
     Thou hast no children, thou has never loved.
“Free waves their flag, the golden sun displaying
        Celestial globe on skies of heavenly blue!
                  The sportive breezes straying,
Waft on our sight the wonder strange and new;
        While the relentless crew
Dart like wild beasts on weaker creatures preying.
        Darken, thou sun, thy fiery light,
And die away in black eternal night.
“What see I here? his quiver and his bow
        Shattered and useless on the trampled sand?
. . . . . . . My hero! Well I know
        They were not torn from unresisting hand.
But these with magic art
                  Can grasp the lightning’s dart
And wake the thunder clap at their command.”
        Some poor relief to find,
So wailed in grief the mourner left behind.
        They heeded not her accents of despair;
A feeble outcast worth no robber’s care.
        And full in view, with every sail unfurled
The Eagle spread her pinions to the air,
        And soared away into the western world.
        Chained in the hold beneath,
        The captives gasped for breath,
And spent their strength in vainly wasted strife,
        A groaning heap of mingled death and life.
While from her hut under the mango shade,
        The childless mother and the widowed wife
Watched the tall poop on the horizon fade."
To Her Portrait,"translated by Roderick Gill
This that you see, the false presentment planned
   With finest art and all the colored shows
   And reasoning of shade, doth but disclose
The poor deceits by earthly senses fanned!
Here where in constant flattery expand
   Excuses for the stains that old age knows,
   Pretexts again the years’ advancing snows,
The footprints of old seasons to withstand;
’Tis but vain artifact of scheming minds;
’Tis but a flower fading on the winds;
   ’Tis but a useless protest against Fate;
’Tis but stupidity without a thought,
   A lifeless shadow, if we meditate;
’Tis dead, ’tis dust, ’tis shadow, yea, ’tis nought"
Love,"translated from the Spanish by Agnes Blake Poor
Fair maid! believe me, love is like a lake,
    Whose crystal depths reflect thy brow of snow;
The roses on thy cheek that come and go,
    When in thy azure eyes the smiles awake,
No passing winds the liquid mirror wake,
    The cool refreshing airs so softly blow.
But hidden currents in the depths below
    The angry surface in an instant shake.
Gaze then in safety from the emerald shore;
    Nor launch thy shallop on the treacherous wave.
Even the gentle touch of thy light oar
    May rouse the slumbering peril from its grave.
Thy fragile bark is on rough waters tossed;
    The picture fades, thou sinkest, and art lost."
Ecstasy,"translated by Muna Lee
Now, O Christ, seal my eyelids,
Let ice on my lips be spread!
All the hours are superfluous,
All the words are said!
He looked on me,
We looked each on each
In silence, for a long space—
Our look as rigid as death’s
The stupor that whitens the face,
In the last agony, blanched us.
After that instant life hold nothing more!
I head him speak
Convulsively. I spoke.
My words—a confusion
Of plentitude, tribulations, and fears—
Hesitated, broke.
I spoke of his destiny, of mine—
A mortar of blood and tears.
After this I know there can be nothing more.
Nothing! No perfume but would roll
Diluted down my cheek.
My ears are shut, my mouth is sealed!
What meaning for me now
By pallid earth could be revealed?
What to me are bleeding roses,
Or quiet snows congealed?
Therefore, O Christ, I plead to You now;
Though when anguished with hunger I stilled my cries.
But now, stop my pulses!
Shut the lids over my eyes!
Protect against the tempest
This flesh that was thronged with his words.
Let not the brutal daylight
Shatter this image to shards.
Receive me! I go without stain.
And I go fulfilled, like a flooded plain."
"shíma yazhí ahéheeʼ / thank you, auntie.","Shíma yazhí / my aunt sits on shílátsíín / my wrist.
               The colors that adorn her hair—łitsxo / orange and yágo doołtizh / blue—
                                                                      are hand plucked and spun from Father Sky.
              It is thin and braided, held together with a silver clasp.
              Shíma yazhí / my aunt points, “Look.”
Shí / my gaze turns,
meeting the dinilchí / pink glow of an early winter morning.
                            It reflects off her eyes
                            like frosted headlights from passing cars on the highway.
ayóó déézk’aaz / it’s cold out, the air turns my breath into white curls,
like smoke from a dying stove ko’ / fire.
If we were in Tsé’ Bit’á’i / Shiprock,
                                               Shíma yazhí / my aunt would have taken me to Sonics
                                               for a late-night dah woozh / strawberry shake.
Shíma yazhí / my aunt draws little circles around the inside of shílátsíín / my wrist.
                                                                                              The edge of biláshgaan / her nail,

                                                                                              grazes my skin like sunlight.
She’s warm—
               her beads are an embrace, as I cry into biwos / her shoulders.
               Shíma yazhí’s / my aunt’s secure, protecting me from evil—
                                                                           like Shímasaní / my grandmother promised.
Her voice makes shíjaa’ / my ears tingle.
I swear I can feel her chapped bidaa’ / lips whisper,
                                                                           Seed beads.

               Shíma yazhí / my aunt tells me to repeat after her.
               I listen like Shimasaní / my grandmother taught me.
                                             When Shíma yazhí / my aunt was an at’ééd / little girl,
                                             she loved looking at the tł’éé’ yá / night sky.
If given the chance, Shíma yazhí / my aunt would have collected
                                                                           all the So’ / stars she could carry
                                                                           in a light dibéłchíʼí / brown pouch.
               I’d like to imagine they’d
               clink and crinkle like
                                             łitso / nickels,
                                             dootłʼizh / dimes,
                                             and łichííʼí / pennies.
Shíma yazhí / my aunt would buy herself a pop and some chips after school
                                                                                                         with so’ łání / the constellations,
                                                                           counting change in bila’ ałts’íísí éí dibéłchíʼí /
                                                                                                         the small, brown palm of her hand.
Shíma yazhí/ my aunt never cried.
               not in front of me,
               not in front of Shíma / my mother.
                                             Before she sat on shílátsíín / my wrist,
                                             she took care of Shíma / my mother
                                             and my uncle / Shíbizhi.
Her strength came from the prayers she said every abíní / morning.
               The woven band on shígaan / my arm,
               a tribute to the power in her voice.
                                             “Don’t look down.” She’d tell me, “Look up.”
Shíma yazhí spreads bílázhoozh / her fingers
                              like dried naadáá’ / corn stalks along my right álátsíín
                                                                                                         —always my right álátsíín.
Shíma yazhí leads me by shígaan
               across dirt roads and muddy ditch paths.
                              I wave at neighbors:
                              the old Diné hastiin dóó tsostsʼid bínaahaií / seven-year-old bitsóí / grandson,
                              the nosey Diné asdzáán / woman and bahastiin / her husband,
                              the Chapter House workers, bickering over last week’s meeting.
When I wave, they recognize Shíma yazhí on shíla’.
               They smile and wave back—they always smile and wave back.
                              I follow Shíma yazhí back to the farm.
                              Sometimes I lose my way.
                              But I know she’s smiling as I kick rocks behind her,
                                             humming an old song she used to sing along with on the radio.
Shíma yazhí sits on my shíla’
                              as her last promise before I left shíghan / home."
Anna,"translated from the French by Marilyn Hacker
Anna the chair was overturned it’s after the end—whatever end—that we must readjust forgetting—paradise Anna sometimes has a taste of mouldy sun—when I think of the sun I want to think of Senac, of Amrouche, of Amrani—but when I think sun I want to think of the California sun, the one I’ve never seen—that mother-earth that nourishes you—and desire makes its place in what perhaps will happen, it doesn’t matter much if it happens—at the end paradise puts the chair back—I’m not saying the chair stands upright again—I’m not saying that it gets up—but isn’t there something that has to be put right and I think that it’s the idea of paradise itself that’s bothering me—in the Koran some remember especially the virgins offered to martyrs—there should be an end to such sacrifice, Anna—of course restore the virgins and the mothers—for the Marabout of Dakar, there was no point in going to Mecca because, he said, Mecca is your mother’s hip—honor your mother’s hip he said—he didn’t say strangle yourself with your umbilical cord—but your mother like Mecca is a promised land—you must go there only once—my mother’s land is a joyful cord—it’s a song in the bath—thawardets—the rose—my mother remembers the bath—all children are beautiful—and paradise, Anna, is a mother in whom you travel only once—a refrain that remains like a faraway pulse—we aren’t perfect, Anna—we aren’t imperfect either—
    Anna
  Anna la chaise est renversée c’est à partir de la fin—n’importe quelle fin—qu’il faudrait réajuster l’oubli—le paradis Anna a parfois un goût de soleil moisi—quand je pense au soleil je veux penser à Sénac à Amrouche à Amrani—mais quand je pense soleil je veux penser au soleil de la Californie—celui que je n’ai jamais vu—cette terre mère qui t’irrigue—le désir prend place dans ce qui adviendra peut-être—peu importe si ça advient—à la fin le paradis rétablit la chaise—je ne dis pas que la chaise redevient droite—je ne dis pas qu’elle se dresse—mais quelque chose n’est-ce pas doit être rétabli et je crois que c’est l’idée même du paradis qui m’inquiète—dans le Coran il ruisselle sous les pieds des mamans—dans le Coran certains retiennent les vierges offertes aux sacrifiés—il faut renverser le sacrifice Anna—sans doute rétablir les vierges et les mères—pour le Marabout de Dakar il ne sert à rien d’aller à la Mecque car dit-il la Mecque c’est le flanc de ta mère—honore le flanc de ta mère dit-il—il ne dit pas étrangle-toi avec ton cordon ombilical—mais ta mère comme une Mecque est une terre promise—il ne faut y voyager qu’une fois—la terre de ma mère est un cordon joyeux—c’est une chanson dans le bain—thawardets—la rose—ma mère se rappelle le bain—tous les enfants sont beaux—et le paradis Anna est une mère dans laquelle on ne voyage qu’une fois—un refrain qui reste comme un battement lointain—nous ne sommes pas parfaits Anna—nous ne sommes pas imparfaits non plus—"

This poem which is a part of my life
must live on as my life: Aragon’s sun
reaching down to me. Snow flurries melting
as they fall on the slopes of Moncayo.
An April day when everything seems alive.
The peal of bells soaks into the centuries-old shadows,
and colorful butterflies tumble in the breeze,
hover above me
and settle on my book,
which lies forgotten in my hands.

child of the enemy,"I’ve seen thousands of Amerasians, and I have two Amerasian [children] of my own. Amerasians are willful and stubborn. They have serious identity problems. They have no discipline. Down the street at the Floating Hotel you’ll find Amerasian prostitutes plying their mothers’ trade. I think there’s a racial thing here, something genetic.

I was born with a twelfth hole. Instantly
the floating world carved its shame
on the dark meat of my face. A love child, child of perfidy, allegiance

the places women leave. An unsuspecting caretaker. The bacterial streets.

That time Tet fell in the year of the snake. As in reptilian. As in 
no turning back. As in when I became
a child of containment. As in how like a monetary policy
I was loosed to an existence feral as a raised bayonet. As in
what the serpent might say: knowledge for knowledge’s sake
is both industrial and complex.

The Bird-Choros of Ion,"translated by H. D.
Birds from Parnassus,
swift
you dart
from the loftiest peaks;
you hover, dip,
you sway and perch
undaunted on the gold-set cornice;
you eagle,
god’s majestic legate,
who tear, who strike
song-birds in mid-flight,
my arrow whistles toward you,
swift
be off;

ah drift,
ah drift
so soft, so light,
your scarlet foot so deftly placed
to waft you neatly
to the pavement,
swan, swan
and do you really think
your song
that tunes the harp of Helios,
will save you
from the arrow-flight?
turn back,
back
to the lake of Delos;

lest all the song notes
pause and break
across a blood-stained throat
gone songless,
turn back,
back
ere it be too late,
to wave-swept Delos.

Alas, and still another,
what?
you’d place your mean nest
in the cornice?
sing, sing
my arrow-string,
tell to the thief
that plaits its house
for fledglings
in the god’s own house,
that still the Alpheus
whispers sweet
to lure
the birdlets to the place,
that still the Isthmus
shines with forests;
on the white statues
must be found
no straw nor litter
of bird-down,
Phœbos must have his portal fair;

and yet, O birds,
though this my labour
is set,
though this my task is clear,
though I must slay you,
I, god’s servant,
I who take here
my bread and life
and sweep the temple,
still I swear
that I would save you,
birds or spirits,
winged songs
that tell to men god’s will;

still, still
the Alpheus whispers clear
to lure the bird-folk
to its waters,
ah still
the Isthmus
blossoms fair;
lest all the song notes
pause and break
across a blood-stained throat
gone songless,
turn back,
back
ere it be too late,
to wave-swept Delos."
Dirt Cakes,"My Grandmother’s body lives
under an ash tree
on an old church ground,
her spirit can be seen making
a maple tree’s shadow jealous.
 
The church’s bricks absorb
the choir’s songs, they flake Holy Ghost,
If Trouble Don’t Come Today.
 
I visit, fall on my knees,
ask her how she doing?
How long is her hair now?
 
Does she still like it braided
in front? Still like having
her scalp scratched?
What y’all doing
in heaven today?
 
She’d tell my mama
don’t let a bird get the hair that falls
out your head, they’ll use it to build a nest
and you’ll never leave Rolesville. Dirt
 
is the only thing I know that can’t die,
it makes sense
we would bury here, makes sense
mama don’t want me playing in it.

"Same Oaks, Same Year","My cousin kept me and his little brother 
saved me from our uncle’s
pit bull, then spent seven years 
in prison for his set.
Every other word 
he said was 
blood.
  Uncle Nuggie showed us
how to make a BB rattle 
inside a squirrel.
Two small holes, 
enter and exit.
All summer I wondered 
what leaves the body?
 "
Gin River,"If the Neuse River was gin
we would’ve drunk to its bottom,
its two-million-year-old currents,
shad, sunfish, redhorse, yellow lance,
All the blood from the Tuscarora War. 
We would have drunk it all,
aunts and uncles would have led us in Big Bill Broonzy’s 
“When I Been Drinking,”
until everything inside us began to dance 
and we all joined in,
silt around our ankles,
everyone kicking sand. 
 "
Odysseus at the Mast,"They lashed him halfway up the mast
And he screamed above the silent oarsmen
As they rowed him relentlessly away
From the bone-cluttered island shore of the Sirens
Sitting in the flowers singing unearthly promise.
            They saw the ship go by,
            and the madman raving there.
            One of them stood up,
            still singing, and made gestures
            with her aching body, using
            hands between thighs, showing
            as well as singing.
            The ship went on by wind and oars.
            The voices faded.
            They shrugged, sucked their sharp teeth,
            and went back to their flowers.
His anxious men, blessed with the silence
Of the blind, saw only the soundless agony
As he fought the bonds of the rigid mast
For the vision the Sirens never dreamed
In a word that faded for ever as he moved
Through life after life in the ship at the mast
And his screaming for release, ceased.
They lowered him down among their flesh
And he mastered again his own flesh and his ship
And remembered, once, an impotent whim for mutiny."
No Ghost Abandoned,"We still celebrate
my Grandmother’s birthday
by frying a slab of fish,
smothering flounder
in Texas Pete,
chicken in Sweet Baby Ray’s,
someone puts on Marvin,
someone says I love you.
How can we lift enough
smoke to reach you?
Our cookout has the blues,
I can’t tell you why
I walk old country roads
looking for your spirit.
I hear you speaking
near the river,
where the water
slows against rocks.
My mother says
the best thing to do
is get addicted to God.
But I write from inside my body,
what’s the price of being
obsessed with the dead?
No ghost abandoned,
you mostly
speak of wind.
Someone put on Marvin,
someone say I love you.
In my purple bedroom,
I’ve heard a woman
long dead speak of gardens,
tomatoes, squash,
white tobacco flowers, lilies
are pretty, but they are weeds.
By the elementary school
we used to pick sweet potatoes,
played games like
that’s my car,
that’s my house.
The lands murmurs
in our hands,
where to grow
the biggest melons,
the place where June Bug
finally died,
what’s so sweet
must be sacred.
We mended the horses
rubbed an old mane
until it was time,
you prepare
an old man for death
by reminding him
of his legs, of his work,
I can still see your silhouette
in the window like a kiss
to a father long gone.
In the kitchen where
I haven’t stepped-in today,
I can hear you
among the spoons
and butter knives
in the drawer.
What do you think
when you see my loneliness?
Living ghost? I must learn
the language of rain
to speak to plants
and the Genesis of how seed
turns to flower.
     "
"January 16, 1967: 5:30 P.M.","so that you will know where the sun was
     . Too cold to look up but going downhill
home, I saw the pink contrail, so high
it began the length of my thumb behind
     the silver nail, going somewhere northwest,
just going, like one of the kids running down the street
streaming long crepe paper behind just to keep
     it in the air. “Beautiful,” I said,
committing myself, thinking about the
cold up there surrounding the pilot
     in the cockpit, comforted by warm
instruments and dialfaces. Then, more than
I could bear, another, coming from where
     the first was going, their flight patterns
giving them all the margin of safety
from fingertip to elbow they passed––
     the ductile, malleable cold making
pink parallel bars that showed how pilots
go from where to when, and why horizons
     lose their distance between the points of going.
Forced into a judgment this time, I saw
that it was good and let them go wherever
     they were going, let the sun go down,
and turned the corner home to my own warm faces, and rested."
Aloft,"I drove East Genesee Street to West Genesee Street
while the sun was setting––the cold winter sun
slowly withdrawing from the walls
of black snow.
I was not driving anywhere in particular, just driving––
and I remembered what Sam once said
about never having been on his way anywhere,
but simply on his way.
And I thought of a dream I’d had
in which I dreamt that I was dreaming––
in which I was also driving
past stolen goods: TVs and stereo equipment
left on the side of the expressway exit ramp
to kiss the immaterial in the night.
Once, years ago, I was suddenly lost
below a huge overcast sky and driving past rows
of anonymous houses
some still with their long leftover Christmas lights
and identical white mailboxes––
and in passing, I glimpsed
a man running up his driveway with two garbage cans
––one in each hand––
He wore a black pinstriped suit.
The garbage cans were his wings, his galvanized steel wings."
If There Is Another World,"If there is another world,
I think you can take a cab there––
or ride your old bicycle
down Junction Blvd.
past the Paris Suites Hotel
with the Eiffel Tower on the roof
and past the blooming Magnolia and on––
to the corner of 168th Street.
And if you’re inclined to,
you can turn left there
and yield to the blind
as the sign urges us––
especially since it is a state law.
Especially since there is a kind of moth
here on the earth
that feeds only on the tears of horses.
Sooner or later we will all cry
from inside our hearts.
Sooner or later even the concrete
will crumble and cry in silence
along with all the lost road signs.
Two days ago 300 televisions
washed up on a beach in Shiomachi, Japan,
after having fallen off a ship in a storm.
They looked like so many
oversized horseshoe crabs
with their screens turned down to the sand.
And if you’re inclined to, you can continue
in the weightless seesaw of the light
through a few more intersections
where people inside their cars
pass you by in space
and where you pass by them,
each car another thought––only heavier."
loose strife (Afterward one woman says the killing fields),"Afterward    one    woman   says   the     killing      fields
are           only             three          kilometers         away
and            that          you      can           walk          there.
The     other     woman   says    it’s    more   than    fifty
and      simply      points   to      the     darkening      sky."
Poetry,"There’s no sense
in telling you my particular
troubles. You have yours too.
Is there value
in comparing notes?
Unlike Williams writing
poems on prescription pads
between patients, I have
no prescriptions for you.
I’m more interested
in the particular
nature and tenor of the energy
of our trouble. Maybe
that’s not enough for you.
Sometimes I stick in
some music. I’m capable
of hallucination
so there’s nothing wrong
with my images. As for me,
I’m not looking for wisdom.
The wise don’t often write
wisely, do they? The danger
is in teetering into platitudes.
Maybe Keats was preternaturally
wise but what he gave us
was beauty, whatever that is,
and truth, synonymous, he wrote,
with beauty, and not the same
as wisdom. Maybe truth
is the raw material of wisdom
before it has been conformed
by ego, fear, and time,
like a shot
of whiskey without
embellishment, or truth lays bare
the broken bone and wisdom
scurries in, wanting
to cover and justify it. It’s really
kind of a nasty
enterprise. Who wants anyone
else’s hands on their pain?
And I’d rather be arrested
than advised, even on my
taxes. So what
can poetry be now? Dangerous
to approach such a question,
and difficult to find the will to care.
But we must not languish, soldiers,
(according to the wise,)
we must go so far as to invent
new mechanisms of caring.
Maybe truth, yes, delivered
with clarity. The tone is up
to you. Truth, unabridged,
has become in itself a strange
and beautiful thing.
Truth may involve a degree
of seeing through time.
Even developing a relationship
with a thing before writing,
whether a bird
or an idea about birds, it doesn’t
matter. But please not only
a picture of a bird. Err
on the side of humility, though
humility can be declarative.
It does not submit. It can even appear
audacious. It takes mettle
to propose truth
and pretend it is generalizable.
Truth should sting, in its way,
like a major bee, not a sweat bee.
It may target the reader like an arrow,
or be swallowable, a watermelon
seed we feared as children
would take up residency in our guts
and grow unabated and change us
forever into something viny
and prolific and terrible.
As for beauty, a problematic word,
one to be side-eyed lest it turn you
to stone or salt,
it is not something to work on
but a biproduct, at times,
of the process of our making.
Beauty comes or it doesn’t, as do
its equally compelling counterparts,
inelegance and vileness.
This we learned from Baudelaire,
Flaubert, Rimbaud, Genet, male poets
of the lavishly grotesque.
You’ve seen those living rooms,
the red velvet walls and lampshades
fringed gold, cat hair thick
on the couches,
and you have been weirdly
compelled, even cushioned,
by them. Either way,
please don’t tell me flowers
are beautiful and blood clots
are ugly. These things I know,
or I know this is how
flowers and blood clots
are assessed by those content
with stale orthodoxies.
Maybe there is such a thing
as the beauty of drawing near.
Near, nearer, all the way
to the bedside of the dying
world. To sit in witness,
without platitudes, no matter
the distortions of the death throes,
no matter the awful music
of the rattle. Close, closer,
to that sheeted edge.
From this vantage point
poetry can still be beautiful.
It can even be useful, though
never wise.
 "
Gertrude Stein,"I’d just brushed the dog, there on the dog’s couch.
I was wearing a black—well, to call it a gown is a criminal
overstatement—a black rag. It became clear to me—
and when I say clear I mean the moment went crystal cathedral—
I could see my life from—not a long shot—
but what they used to call an increment apart—a baby step
to the right or left of myself—about the width of a corrective
baby shoe. There I was, broad-shouldered, witch-shaped
without the associated magic—with my dog in my shack—
once mauve faded to pink—beyond sex or reason—
a numbness had set in—Gertrude Stein, Picasso’s portrait of her—
that above-it-all—or within-it-all—look on—not a face
but the planes that suggest a face—the eyes
aren’t really lined up right or the real eyes are peering
from behind the cut-out shapes of eyes. The couch
had been a sort of—not a gift—but a donation of sorts
from a person with plenty of money. When it was dragged
into my house it was already—stately—but with worn patches
and stains. A trinity of dogs over time had laid claim to it—
three egotists. To brush the dog meant I had to visit it
in its monarchy—and in that visit—that single prismatic
increment—I saw I’d become—maybe all arrive in their own time—
some before dying, some after—a draped artifact—
haystack or headstone rising out of the plains—
and then, with fascination—and a degree
of sadness and even objectivity—I loved—
as I once loved “Tender Buttons”—myself.
 "
Weeds,"The danger of memory is going
to it for respite. Respite risks
entrapment. Don’t debauch
yourself by living
in some former version of yourself
that was more or less naked. Maybe
it felt better then, but you were
not better. You were smaller, as the rain
gauge must fill to the brim
with its full portion of suffering.
What can memory be in these terrible times?
Only instruction. Not a dwelling.
Or if you must dwell:
The sweet smell of weeds then.
The sweet smell of weeds now.
An endurance. A standoff. A rest.
 "
Comma,"To never be touched again. That line
has a sound. Hear it?
I don’t want to bring a story
to it. Not even an image.
It has a sound. Listen.
To never be touched. Oh, a nurse,
a doctor, but never to be touched in that way.
You know what way. Listen.
Hear it. Let’s not tag it with a feeling.
Give me a break. What possible song
would you play when you toss my ashes,
someone once asked me.
There is no song, he said. Don’t
narrativize, Diane. Don’t narrativize Diane.
See what a comma can do?
 "
Curl,"No longer at home in the world
and I imagine
never again at home in the world.
Not in cemeteries or bogs
churning with bullfrogs.
Or outside the old pickle shop.
I once made myself
at home on that street,
and the street after that,
and the boulevard. The avenue.
I don’t need to explain it to you.
It seems wrong
to curl now within the confines
of a poem. You can’t hide
from what you made
inside what you made
or so I’m told.
 "
Charity Balls,"I had a fellowship, but lived poorly
On slices of pizza.
Later, a career of washing lettuce;
but I have always been the same.
It’s a question of acquiring a mastery of tone
Beneath the crystal chandeliers and champagne
on a glass table top.
At the age of five I thought Scarlett O’Hara
a fictional character. It was not until
The age of forty-eight I knew she was real.
Old clothes and bedroom slippers and a scarf
Wrapped around her head
In low cost tenement housing.
She began talking about my writing
And her sex life.
I’m curt by nature and dolorous.
But I knew if I worked hard I’d eventually make it."
au rive,"What kind of poem would one write if one could?
What would one do with some money, if he had it, perhaps
       to travel; but to where?
To experience Wednesday twilight, immediately after
       dark: is that a promise to be kept
Naturally one can’t be sure until any of these things don’t
       come true?"
Music,"   For Gerrit
  What is poetry? an image
      in the mirror;
reflection from a broadside
    pinned to the wall,
    penned by a friend,
        from where old feelings
        old meanings arise;
relief from pain; the diligence of work.
Mysterious words upon a page in adolescence;
listening to poets read. What is poetry?
       Breath, competence, success
or simply Eros.
                          “Four sides to every thing.”
The increase in electricity causes lights to flow.
   Is it only light, or heat,
      words ordered in a row.
Men or gods. I’ll never know
      or try to know
          more than the doing,
                  the flowing
rain upon the roof. That one hears,
                  and reveres
inside, away from the cold
    within the house
       where the heat
reminds one of what it is to be like
               out in the cold
   rushing over the field
     mad,
Intelligence or emotion?     language."
Money Is Not Monogamous,"A poor man cannot make use of himself.
He is demoralized through excessive beat exertion.
He cannot take orders even for the good of himself
Usually quite to the contrary.
He surrenders for despair although believes surrounding conditions.
He produces fiery revolution in unconscious rebellion.
He believes anything that happens
as misfortune of others.
Quickening as rain on highways, he plunges into chance
faith, duty or conscience culminating legends
of eros, beauty, will & condition
upon distance or parent organization.
He swims with the tide, taking care
he has undressed for it & surveyed its relation
to majority use, freely contributing to its content & current form,
little saving resources toward relentless tides
of time, shallow depths & eventual discharge.
He recognizes none of these fears, not their predicted fact."
Reading in Bed,"by evening light, at the window, where wind blows
it’s not enough to wake with morning
as a child, the insistent urge of habit
sounds, to write a poem, to pore over one’s past
recall ultimate orders one has since doubted
in despair. Inner reality returns
of moonlight over water at Gloucester, as
fine a harbor as the Adriatic, Charles said, before the big storm
blew up to land ancient moorings, shards against sand
of memory at midnight; ah yes the dream begins
of lips pressed against yours over waves, tides,
hour-long auto rides into dawn, when time
pounds a mystery on the beach, to no death out of reach."
Feti’s Border Crossing,
kretek-ing,"translated by Pauline Fan
i like to watch your breast heave, the pulse of your green veins
smoldering at the crack of my lips,
your brimming breath speaks passion
bloodrush like the swell of desire in a room
surging higher and higher to my eyes, craving life;
our mouths thirst for milk and wellsprings
our clothes laugh, unashamed, into death throes
oblivious to the day’s disquiet;
you close your eyes, compose your shoulders, offer your neck
and tiny hairs unfurl into games and crosswords,
my nose is doglike, my fingers swarm around you
your smiling breath hoists my clavicle
like a wheel that rises and falls with your sighs
—at last you inhale a whole spirit
with several lives—while your eyes wink in pleasure;
i finger the kretek lit by her body,
as smoke seeps to your sublime realm of solemn jest and becomes a city;
i have touched it, i seize it all on a day like this
on a day you urge me to conquer, a day like this.
    ngeretek 
  senang menyaksikan degup dada, degup urat hijaumu
oleh kerana aku hangat di rekahan bibir
ruah nafasmu bercakap berahi
alir deras darah sebagai ghairah di kamar
makin lama, makin naik ke mataku, menagih hidup
mulut kita haus mencari susu dan mata air
dan pakaian tak malu ketawa lantas sakarat
tanpa menghiraukan keresahan hari
mata kau tutup, bahu kau bawa, leher kau serah
dan rambut kecil menjadi permainan dan teka kata
hidungku sebagai anjing, dan jemariku menghurungmu
senyum nafasmu takal bahuku,
sebagai roda yang seturun dan senaik desahmu
—kau hela akhirnya sekujur ruhwi
dengan sejumlah hayat—sambil kelip matamu mengenyit suka
di antara jariku sudah siap kretek dicucuh tubuh
sedang asapnya nyusup ke dalam luhur canda seriusmu menjadi kota
telah ku jamah, ku takluk seluruhnya di hari yang seperti ini
di hari yang kau pinta aku jajahi, hari yang seperti ini."
Fatherland,"translated by Aliki Barnstone
Marathon is an ancient city,
almost Elysian, I say,
as we climb the hill
that holds the dead,
saffron bulbs everywhere.
Here is the tomb, white as bone,
the sea cobalt blue,
the day naked.
Marathos means root, I say,
as we pick the green root
that bears Marathon’s name
for our food—fennel’s fragrant spell.
How quickly things are forgotten,
losing shape,
losing their names,
turning into something else.
There are words in your mouth
instead of screams:
Yes, you passed through the checkpoint.
No, you did not have a passport.
No, you were not an adult.
You were unfit to travel.
You stuttered as you spoke.
You stumbled as you walked.
You misheard instructions.
You consigned the secret to your brothers—
they kept you alive, after all!
You borrowed their boat.
The Coast Guard ordered you around
like a metronome.
Now the light is switched on,
punishing as snow.
For me it’s a wingspan.
For you it collapses into your spring
like a heavy construction.
    Πατρικό έδαφος 
  Ο Μαραθώνας είναι αρχαία πόλη,
σχεδόν Ηλύσια, λέω, 
καθώς σκαρφαλώνουμε τον λόφο 
που περιέχει τους νεκρούς,
παντού βολβοί σαφράνια.
Ο τάφος είναι εδώ, λευκός σαν κόκαλο,
η θάλασσα στο μπλε του κοβαλτίου,
η μέρα γυμνή.
Μάραθος σημαίνει ρίζα, λέω,
καθώς μαζεύουμε την πράσινη ρίζα
για να τη βάλουμε στο φαγητό– 
ξόρκι ευωδιαστό.
Πόσο γρήγορα τα πράγματα ξεχνιόνται,
χάνουνε σχήμα,
χάνουνε όνομα,
γίνονται κάτι άλλο.
Λέξεις στο στόμα
αντί για κραυγές:
Ναι, πέρασες το σημείο ελέγχου.
Όχι, δεν είχες διαβατήριο.
Όχι, δεν ήσουν ενήλικας.
Ήσουν ανήμπορος να ταξιδέψεις.
Τραύλιζες όταν μιλούσες.
Παραπατούσες όταν περπάταγες.
Κατάλαβες λάθος τις οδηγίες.
Εμπιστεύτηκες το μυστικό στα αδέρφια σου–
αυτά σε είχαν άλλωστε κρατήσει ζωντανό!
Δανείστηκες τη λέμβο τους.
Ο Ακτοφύλακας σε διέταξε 
σαν μετρονόμος.
Τώρα το φως είναι αναμμένο,
τιμωρητικό σαν το χιόνι.
Για μένα είναι άνοιγμα φτερών.
Για σένα καταρρέει στην άνοιξη σου
σαν μια βαριά κατασκευή."
God Was Willing Sis: I’m Home,"Rebuilt our little shotgun house
Daddy bought for $2000 on the G.I. Bill 
Post-WWII in the 7th Ward.
Wide enough to love two families at a time, double,
Long & wide like a bulldog, stocky with a sturdy gait
Seemingly indestructible
With turn-of-the-century
Plaster & lath between walls held by red-brick fireplaces
Anchors for kin to hold on to
Steady, outlasting many storms
From Betsy to Camille, hurricanes that came &
Went like occasional visitors who
Overstay their welcome.
Here, we saved every book we ever had from
Old Bibles listing births, marriages, Deaths, to 
Sherlock Holmes & Harvard Classics,
Two dictionaries American Heritage & Webster’s, plus 
The American Peoples Encyclopedia,
That answered questions Daddy or Mother couldn’t from newspapers:
The States Item, but especially
The Louisiana Weekly
Where Negroes had starring roles as newly married or
Debuted, or swimmers medaled in photos with their
Part-time coaches, who were full-time teachers like 
Vic Vavassaur, with their own kids too
Who spent summers, Saturdays & after-school time 
Teaching us regulation sports from
Baseball, football, swimming to supervised play, where
We were all a team, & neighbors &
Grudges never lasted more than an hour or
No longer than a busted 
Lip that’s gone when the swelling fades &
Heals like our sunburns &
Summers between thundershowers
We see coming blocks away
Our shot-gun castle
Our guardian of refuge from those
Jim Crow days in our 7th Ward Neighborhood
When we had all we needed for comfort, & summer fun of 
Shaved ice or hucklebucks, &
Winters without cold &
No gunshots."
In Way of Music Water Answers,"Like water I am eager 
Like water I am thinking 
Like water I always move 
Like water I am thinking time

pathways and open going nowhere

Roaming the Forest of Eager Talking,"The eager clattering singing wastes my listening 
and I am over 
ready to run breathing the ways the 
sticks invite my wanting 
I want to think in feeling ways the talking thinks 
in moving ways the sticks invite 
thinking answering their questions 
the eager clattering singing does 
always interrupt the sailing play 
the play is the questions the sailing 
is the tears I know the tears 
will overfill ready to become

Last Privacy,"Ancient kites, found in deserts 
of the Middle East, are constructions 
aimed at driving and trapping 
game animals. They consist 
of long dry stone walls 
converging on a neck 
which opens into a confined space 
used as the killing floor. 
The last night, unknowingly 
I lovingly effervesced the long catalog 
of my admirations for you into 
your ear. Hammer strike 
anvil. The last morning, 
I studied you sitting 
quietly studying the water 
in the toilet bowl. I brushed 
your hair. Gave you a kiss. 
Told you, “I love you.” Minutes later, 
we walked outside our door the final time,
rode the elevator down together. Crossed
the lobby and vestibule, out the front door
onto the wide sidewalk of our building. 
All the while, unaware of the drive. 
Your last moments under a bluebird sky.
Your last moment standing
at the end of the fatal kite."
Little Richard,"On a walk past bulldozers and trucks
pouring tarmac for the NJ Eisenhower highway
my grandmother said to me as we turned
into a market with olive barrels, hanging 
meat, piles of sumac and coriander—
“he shakes away my blues.” It was 1959,
and what did I know about starving  
in the Syrian desert or the Turkish whips 
that lashed the bodies of Armenian 
women on the roads of dust. I wouldn’t 
have believed that she saw 
those things. The radio 
was always on the sink in my grandmother’s 
kitchen. “He’s a whirling dervish” she said—
whirling dervish—the whoosh of the phrase 
stayed with me. I too felt his trance—
even then—as she pounded spices
with a brass mortar and pestle.
The air on fire under him
the red clay of Macon dusting his bones.
What did I know about Sufism 
Sister Rosetta or bird feet at the Royal Peacock?
In the yard the bittersweet is drying up,
the berries turning gold and red.
The way memory deepens with light. 
His shaking gospel voice. The heart
going up in flames. My grandmother
survived the worst that humans do."
Inspiration,"We waited at the Hemingway bar in Ronda    
   with the little bandit museum outside.

You joked I was a bad American  
  for not wanting to go to the bullfight.

There’s the kind with the stabbing at the end and the other
   where the bull doesn’t die.

You thought the second might get me to write.    
  I asked, Would there still be bullfights without tourists?

Holding a glass of whiskey, I remembered the New York Times 
  neutrally describing cultural value

and profit pitted against animal rights.    
  You bundled salami off a plate and sighed.

I am sorry I tried to help with your poems. Then, smiling,    
  I’d like to be worth your time."

 "
who were these goddesses,"translated by Samantha Schnee
They were so called because they wore god’s mask, and be-
cause their faces and hearts were resolute as stone. For days,
years, they walked with jade beneath their tongues, seeking
home. They worked the land and bejeweled their bodies. Not
as a sign of vanity, but because they tended the amaranth in
their yearning for fire. Xiuhtecuhtli was their god; xiuhtlatoa
their language, meaning “words of fire”—that which ignites
the heart. They were careful not to use xaltlatoa, “words of
sand”, fleeting, vague and un-understandable. At night
they accompanied the Sun on his descent. They were jade,
translucent, and purified the underworld, deciphering dest-
iny. Their essence dwelt in the Afterlife. Their petals arose in
song. They adorned their Home with hymns and flowers and
filled their desire with vision, fine chalice of the sagacious
seed. The upper half of their bodies naked; Their breasts
were buds of omexóchitl and their verdant dreams the
sprigs of a birch. From their legs blossomed the pure wh-
ite feathers of the quetzal. Coatlicue, the goddess mother,
gave birth to the Sun and Moon. With a sword of fire, the
Sun beheaded the Moon and tossed her body down
the steps, shattering it in a thousand pieces, Coyolxauhqui
covered head to toe in shining rattles of vipers. She fell
and entered darkness. And so it was recorded on the
tree of ámatl: Light and shadow will not last. So says
the history of woman: she sought to recreate what
was within her to rewrite the Book:
The song will be reborn
in each body in such a way that we learn
to redefine what is ours, as our daughters will,
too, and our daughters’ daughters, and their
daughters’ daughters will know that their
bodies are light on Earth, heat of the sun with
its tona, energy, fecundity, song that dances
along the perimeter of stars. And so, they watch
over us from the firmament at dusk and dawn
as the sun is born and dies. These goddess
-es of water were destined to be masters
of their own desire, guides of their own
light. We must engrave on our hearts:
The place where goddesses are born.
    sobre quiénes eran estas diosas
  Las llamaban así por ser portadoras de la máscara del dios, y
por tener un rostro propio y un corazón firme como la
piedra. Soles, años caminaron con el jade bajo su lengua en
pos de la Casa. Labraron la tierra y adornaron sus cuerpos
con joyeles de oro, no como símbolo de vanidad, sino por
ser cuidadoras del amaranto en su anhelo de flama. Xiuh-
tecuhtli era su dios; xiuhtlatoa, su lengua, lo cual quiere
decir «palabra de fuego», esa que enciende el corazón. El-
las cuidaban de no usar la xaltlatoa,  «palabra de arena»,
que escurridiza huye sin dejarse aprehender. Por las no-
ches acompañaban en su descenso al Sol. Ellas eran el
jade y eran la transparencia, purificaban el inframundo
y descifraban el sino. En el Más Allá moraba su funda-
mento. Sus pétalos en cantos se alzaban. Con himnos y
flores ornaban su Casa y su deseo llenaban de visión, fino
cáliz de fulgor y semilla. Llevaban la mitad de su cuerpo sin
cubrir; eran brotes de omexóchitl sus senos y su sueño, verde
yema de tepozán. Y de sus piernas florecían las blanqu-
ísimas plumas de quetzal. Así fue que Coatlicue, diosa
madre, dio a luz al Sol y a la Luna. Con su espada de fuego,
él decapitó a la Luna, y por la escalinata su cuerpo rodó, y se
fragmentó en mil pedazos. Coyolxauhqui yacía toda re-
cubierta de radiantes cascabeles de sierpe. Al caer,
entró en la oscuridad. Y por ello ha quedado
grabado en el árbol del «ámatl»: Transitoria será
la luz y su sombra. Dice así la historia de la mujer:
buscó rehacer su interioridad pra reescribir el Libro:
El canto renacerá en cada cuerpo de forma que
aprendamos a resignificar el propio, y así nuestras hijas,
y las hijas de nuestras hijas, y las hijas de sus hijas,
sabrán que su cuerpo es luz en Tierra, calor de Sol
con su tona, energía, fecundación, canto que danza
en derredor de las estrellas. Es así que nos vigil-
an desde el firmamento cada mañana y cada
noche, al nacer y al caer el Sol. Las diosas del
agua tenían como propio ser dueñas
de su deseo, guías de su luz. Y así lo
habremos de inscribir en nuestros
corazones:
Lugar donde nacen las diosas."
Grief #213,"I grieve forced laughter, shrieks sharp as broken
champagne flutes and the bright white necks I wanted
to press the shards against. I grieve the dead bird of my right
hand on my chest, the air escaping my throat’s prison,
the scream mangled into a mere “ha!” I grieve unearned
exclamations. I grieve saying “you are so funny!” I grieve
saying “you’re killing me!” when I meant to say “you are
killing me.” I have died right in front of you so many times;
my ghost is my plus-one tonight. I grieve being your Black
confidante. I grieve being your best and your only. I grieve
“But you get it, right?” Right. I grieve that I got it
and I get it and I am it."
We Used Our Words We Used What Words We Had,"we used our words we used what words we had

to weld, what words we had we wielded, kneeled,

we knelt. & wept we wrung the wet the sweat

we wracked our lips we rang for words to ward

off sleep to warn to want ourselves. to want

the earth we mouthed it wound our vowels until

it fit, in fits the earth we mounted roused

& rocked we harped we yawned & tried to yawp

& tried to fix, affixed, we facted, felt.

we fattened fanfared anthemed hammered, felt

the words’ worth stagnate, snap in half in heat

the wane the melt what words we’d hoarded halved

& holey, porous. meanwhile tide still tide.

& we: still washed for sounds to mark. & marked."
Poem About My Life Mattering,"Asked myself this morning—this usual—where is black life found?
Surely not in an atlas given how they cull the size
of the Continent down as carefully managed roach control,
But other nights I hear myself singing down a well and it sounds
a trumpet or at least the mouth of Joseph trying to have a good time,
you know? When the stars decided the fly tanning on Mike Pence’s
picket-fence hair—was that black life? And should I shed myself
of that chitin and decide this black self—and so grow a spine—
who must I show it to? I wouldn’t recommend history either,
But black life died for me to sip high-fructose liquids with less ice:
no matter whose skin I wear I can’t laugh at that. A parallel history
is right next door and the neighbor’s dog keeps barking my name."
The Beauty of Autistic Knowing,"The way of learning pace
was how I learned to string
words the way language paths 
and makes meanings the way
jar of thinking was really

bathing in brine wanting to
for readers to understand
but the management of
language at ABA schools
was demanding speech and

because I couldn’t speak
I was going to the lines of
watchful therapists that tried
the same words over and
over again so I wasn’t

able to express myself
in the ways they thought
I should and that was awful
for me so I want the world
to know that autistic language does a bathing talking feeling

and seeing that immerses
everything and the bathing is
the beauty of autistic knowing."
Fête Gallante,"translated by Richard Aldington

The Morning Star flies from the clouds and the bird cries to the dawn.
Amaryllis, awake! Lead your snowy sheep to pasture while the cold grass glitters with white dew.
To-day I will pasture my goats in a shady valley, for later it will be very hot.
Among those distant hills lies a very great valley cut by a fair stream.
Here there are cold rills and soft pasture and the kind wind engenders many-coloured flowers.
Dear, there I shall be alone, and if you love me, there you will come alone also.
    Lusus Pastorales continens (IV) 
  Jam fugat humentes formosus Lucifer umbras,
    Et dulci Auroram voce salutat avis;
Surge, Amarylli, greges niveos in pascua pelle,
    Frigida dum cano gramina rore madent.
Ipse meas hodie nemorosa in valle capellas
    Pasco, namque hodie maximus æstus erit.
Scis ne Menandrei fontem, & vineta Galefi?
    Et quæ formosus rura Lycambus habet?
Hos inter colles recubat viridissima silva,
    Quam pulcher liquido Mesulus amne secat:
Nec gelidi fontes absunt, nec pabula læta,
    Et varios flores aura benigna parit.
Illic te maneo solus, carissima Nympha:
    Si tibi sum carus, tu quoque sola veni."
On Reading Allen Ginsberg’s “Homework”,"after an article in the New York Times 
It was in the Financial Section. On page 3, below
the fold. A huge multi-national conglomerate is
praised for an “innovative marketing program”
that washes dirty clothes and linens for free  
after a disaster. This time it’s the tornado
that tore through Joplin, but Loads of Hope
began after Katrina. When I think how hard
and costly it was to wash everything we
didn’t throw away after 9/11, my eyes
well up. To begin with, no water or electricity.
It would be months before new machines
arrived to replace those contaminated by dust.
Everything in closets, dressers, chests had to be
hauled to a distant laundry. The sheer number
of quarters it took, the fear that, no matter
how many wash, rinse and spin cycles, 
our clothes would never be clean enough
to put against skin. Allergic to perfumes
as I became after 9/11, I want to breathe
in the Tide of cleanliness; to be one of the lucky,
leaving our filthy belongings with strangers
to remove what they can of disaster and return
them to us, clean, neatly folded, wrapped 
in paper, bagged, and tied with a ribbon."

Wild Horses Drink from the River of History,"Hours before dark, I follow the stony path
from the parking lot to the river bank. 
Along the shore I look for crushed branches and trampled grass,
the clearing where wild horses are said to appear.
Then, I hide behind a mesquite tree, hold my breath.
I want to know their secrets.
Finally the mares and foals emerge from the woods
and stand, ankle deep, among the dense reeds.
At once the entire herd bows their heads,
laps the cool water, takes the river into themselves. 
If I were brave, if I’d forget 
to move past the brokenness of my own family,
I’d approach these unclaimed, unnamed creatures.
I’d stroke their brown manes, 
feed them sugar apples and snow peas.
We’d share one fearless story.
Now the Mustangs dig their feet under the tall grass.
I step forward, snap a few pictures,
as if the camera could capture 
when my unsettled heart and theirs became one.
Overhead, the whir of helicopter blades
cuts through a questioning sky.
Suddenly there’s a thousand echoes,
galloping hooves ringing over badlands.
I turn and look back to the river
which flows on, relentlessly, carrying with it
every story of who or what has come and gone.
And the sun sets, dropping behind the mountain,
leaving a blue ridge, a dimming thread of gold.
I get into my car, head up switchbacks
that lead me to the open highway and down towards the city
where lights shimmer like the past of distant stars."
Karma,"my heart keeps breaking does not stop breaking
            —Agha Shahid Ali
            What are the chances, Shahid, you will 
yardstick your way out of the wintering ground’s 
pinafore of snow with the identical song 
memory now recites for me, 
like the time our car stuttered to a stop
in the middle of the street, or when those orchids 
bordering the far side of the walk had to be 
wing bones once, the prehistoric gull’s flight before 
consciousness was pegged by man,
before rain shuddered like a crowd’s deafening voice, 
that same pitch loneliness factors from silence, 
or when one’s hands and knees are on the earth 
and sorrow becomes a hundred silver fish heads 
thrown in a market in China. How 
burnt grass in California carried a warning wind 
that still hurts someone’s lungs in upper Canada. . . 
            What, what are the chances a piece of my flesh 
glow-wormed its way into your heart as a single word 
would in the future of someone’s open mouth, or that 
the ones we loved were once the ones we hated, how 
my undoing passion for Moon Jellyfish means the next 
life will be empty freedom and all sex, or opposite:
a taproot set in the garden where 
the impress darkness smells like saffron and blood 
as it retrieves the desert’s mirage water
over and over again, all the while we’re here, 
knowing this loss phrases some god’s gain or damn,
that obsidian wasn’t merely volcanic glass 
but the last jewel set deep in your brain?"
The Nightingale to the Workman,"translated by Rose Pastor Stokes and Helena Frank
Fair summer is here, glad summer is here!
O hark! ’tis to you I am singing:
The sun is all gold in a heaven of blue,
The birds in the forest are trilling for you,
The flies ’mid the grasses are winging;
The little brook babbles—its secret is sweet.
The loveliest flowers would circle your feet,—
And you to your work ever clinging! . . .
Come forth! Nature loves you. Come forth! Do not fear!
Fair summer is here, glad summer is here,
Full measure of happiness bringing.
All creatures drink deep; and they pour wine anew
In the old cup of life, and they wonder at you.
Your portion is waiting since summer began;
Then take it, oh, take it, you laboring man! 
’Tis summer today; ay, summer today!
The butterflies light on the flowers.
Delightfully glistens the silvery rain.
The mountains are covered with greenness again.
And perfumed and cool are the bowers.
The sheep frisk about in the flowery vale.
The shepherd and shepherdess pause in the dale.
And these are the holiest hours! . . .
Delay not, delay not, life passes away!
’Tis summer today, sweet summer today!
Come, throttle your wheel’s grinding power! . . .
Your worktime is bitter and endless in length;
And have you not foolishly lavished your strength?
O think not the world is with bitterness rife,
But drink of the wine from the goblet of life.
O, summer is here, sweet summer is here!
I cannot forever be trilling;
I flee on the morrow. Then, you, have a care!
The crow, from the perch I am leaving, the air
With ominous cries will be filling.
O, while I am singing to you from my tree
Of love, and of life, and of joy yet to be.
Arouse you!—O why so unwilling! . . .
The heavens remain not so blue and so clear;—
Now summer is here! Come, summer is here!
Reach out for the joys that are thrilling!
For like you who fade at your wheel, day by day,
Soon all things will fade and be carried away.
Our lives are but moments; and sometimes the cost
Of a moment overlooked is eternity lost."
Billie,"He was as a god,
stepped out of eternal dream
along the boardwalk.
He looked at my girl,
a dream to herself and
that was the end of them.
They disappeared beside the sea
at Revere Beach as
I aint seen them since.
If you find anyone
answering their description
please let me know. I need them
to carry the weight of my life
The old gods are gone. What lives on
in my heart
is their flesh
like a wound,
a tomb, a bomb."
In Public,"Promise you wont forget
each time we met
we kept our clothes on
despite obvious intentions
to take them off,
seldom kissed or even slept,
talked to spend desire,
worn exhausted from regret.
Continue our relationship apart
under surveillance, torture, persecuted
confinement’s theft; no must or sudden blows
when embodied spirits mingled
despite fall’s knock
we rode the great divide
of falsehood, hunger and last year"
Private Estate,"             Dancing dandelions
   and buttercups in the grass
remind me of other summer
flowers, simple blossoms
roses and tiger lilies by the wall
         milk pod, sumac branches
lilacs across the road, daisies, blueberries
snaps, cut violets
             three years ago still grow in my mind
as peonies or planted geraniums, bachelor buttons
in downy fields filled with clover
lover, come again and again up fern
path upheld as memory’s perennial
against stern hard-faced officers of imprisonment
and cold regulation more painful than lover’s arms
or flowers charming but not more lasting.
No, the wild tulip shall outlast the prison wall
no matter what grows within."
Forthcoming,"    to Fernand Léger
I died in loneliness
for no one cared for me enough
to become a woman for them
that was not my only thought
and with a woman
she wanted another one
I died in loneliness
of that I am not afraid
but that I am a clank
upon the gutter, a new guard at twilight
without a dream of adolescence
frustration plucked as strong
I died in loneliness
without friends or money
they were taken off
long ago, a melodrama
sounded out my name, the glass key of a
torch song on Father’s Day
I died in loneliness
away from the beach and speeding cars
back seat in love with Bunny
on the way to Howard Johnson’s
beyond the blue horizon
hunting for a lost popular tune."
Loss,"To live without the one you love
an empty dream never known
true happiness except as such youth
watching snow at window
listening to old music through morning.
Riding down that deserted street
by evening in a lonely cab
     past a blighted theatre
oh god yes, I missed the chance of my life
     when I gasped, when I got up and
        rushed out the room
          away from you."

Without vision, we see only this world."
II Alone,"Sustained by poetry, fed anew
by its fires to return from madness,
the void does not beckon as it used to.
Littered with syllables, the road does not loom
as a chasm. The hand of strangers on other
doors does not hurt, the breath of gods
does not desert, but looms large
as a dream, a prairie within our dream,
to which we return, when we need to.
Oh blessed plain, oh pointed chasm."
For Huncke,"Knowing no other god than this:
the man who places on your mouth
a kiss. Keep no mystery
but his who whispers memory.
Though he lead you to the desert
or over hills where famine
flowers, like the locust
he devours what he loves most.
Saving none for tomorrow, or dawn
comes with empty arms, and he knows no way
to feed himself, feeding off others,
he has many, who find him, help him
you be one and dedicate your life
and misery to the upkeep of this cheapskate
you love so much no one else
seems to bridge the gap
with their common habits and rude manners,
his never were, a perfect gentleman
who leaves no trace, but lingers through the room
after he has gone, so I would follow
anywhere, over desert or mountain,
it’s all the same if he’s by my side.
The guide and wizard I would worship and obey,
my guardian teacher, who knows how to stay
alive on practically nothing in the city
until help comes, usually from a stranger or youth.
Such I am or was who knew no better
but all that I better forget now since I met you
and fell into that pit of the past with no escape.
You knock on the door, and off I go with you
into the night with not even a cent in my pockets,
without caring where or when I get back
But if once you put your hand on my shoulders
as David Rattray did last evening
that would be enough, on the seventh night
of the seventh moon, when Herd Boy
meets the Weaving Lady in heaven
and wanders forever lost in arms
until dawn when you come no more."

Act #2,"For Marlene Dietrich
I took love home with me,
we fixed in the night and
sank into a stinging flash.
¼ grain of love
          we had
2 men on a cot, a silk
cover and a green cloth
over the lamp.
        The music was just right.
I blew him like a symphony,
   it floated and
          he took me
down the street and
          left me here.
3 AM. No sign.

Foster’s was never like this.
I’ll walk home, up the

             came down.
He’ll never come back,

              tomorrow nor pot
tonight to smoke till dawn.
He’s gone and taken
my morphine with him

Sonnet VIII,"translated by Viscount Strangford
Mondego! thou, whose waters cold and clear 
Gird those green banks, where fancy fain would stay, 
Fondly to muse on that departed day 
When Hope was kind and Friendship seem’d sincere; 
—Ere I had purchas’d knowledge with a tear.
—Mondego! though I bend my pilgrim way 
To other shores, where other fountains stray,
And other rivers roll their proud career, 
Still—nor shall time, nor grief, nor stars severe, 
Nor widening distance e’er prevail in aught 
To make thee less to this sad bosom dear; 
And Memory oft, by old Affection taught, 
Shall lightly speed upon the plumes of thought, 
To bathe amongst thy waters cold and clear!
    [Doces e claras aguas do Mondego,] 
  Doces e claras aguas do Mondego, 
Doce repouso de minha lembrança, 
Onde a comprida e pérfida esperança 
Longo tempo apoz si me trouxe cego.
De vós me aparto, si; porém não nego, 
Que inda a longa memoria, que me alcança. 
Me não deixa de vós fazer mudança. 
Mas quanto mais me alongo, mais me achego.
Bem poderá a Fortuna este instrumento 
Da alma levar por terra nova e extranha, 
Oíferecido ao mar remoto, ao vento.
Mas a alma, que de cá vos acompanha. 
Nas azas do ligeiro pensamento 
Para vós, aguas, vôa, e em vós se banha."
Tasting the Last of the Ice Age,"We stuffed our mouths with snow 
& bark on sleds to the border. 
The ice hotel was not forgot. 
Sleds kept their ice caps on 
& skidded between forest folk— 
they waved, they cried, we saw it all.  
We live in the hotel beyond estrangement. 
It floods sinks swerves—
Ultraviolet auroras on postcards slip
from their raining frames.
The diamond chandeliers
hold prismatic sleepers 
between glass sheets. 
When staircases come down
we lose distinctions.
Still thrilled, yes, thrilling as ever— 
the midnight sun stays on & on.
We do not anyway think of leaving.
Cities nearly all torched.   
Pull-apart bodies stagger
into melting ice. One
drinks from a frozen glass 
then drinks the glass too, 
face at frost removes. 
Flakes ache to re-constellate.
This dawn a pair of lovers, 
were trapped in an ice alcove, caving, 
beneath a smeared Patagonia 
cover, and puffer jacket, p.53? 
Stone told—“look under me.” 
They were already dead.                         
Hardly anyone notices a tender 
chilling bliss. The giant cumulous 
are walk-ons for permanence. 
All the slow night they are there."
from “There where it’s so bright in me”,"translated by Todd Fredson
Do I want to be part of this world
Do I want to sleep soundly
Do I want to keep living
Soul tranquil heart serene
The worm’s in the fruit
From the start of time
Humanity’s truth is elsewhere
Here maybe
Written on skin
As if life preferred
Only a single color
In a world so diverse
The pigmentation of the skin
Requires an understanding
That continually eludes
It happens in your head
The threat
Like a flame tree
Blossoming in the shadow of the mind
    extrait de «Là où il fait si clair en moi» 
  Ai-je envie de faire partie de ce monde
Ai-je envie de dormir à poings fermés
Ai-je envie de continuer à vivre
L’âme tranquille le cœur serein
Le ver est dans le fruit
Depuis toujours
La vérité de l’humanité est ailleurs
Ici-même
Inscrite sur la peau de couleur
Comme si la vie ne possédait
Qu’une seule couleur
Dans un monde si divers
La pigmentation de la peau
Échappe aux cloisons
De votre entendement
C’est dans la tête que ça se passe
La menace
Comme un flamboyant en fleurs
S’épanouit à l’ombre de l’esprit."
Our Quarantine Story,"after Dorothea Grossman
During the pandemic, after he was laid off, it was his idea
to forage for edible weeds around Queens when our food grew scarce.

From the stoop, I would watch him crouched on one knee,
his bare hands between telephone poles,

pulling up green stars from the control joints
under our mailbox full of clover mites & commercial flyers.

I almost forgot how sprawl could be so quiet.

When he returned inside, he rinsed off the stalks,
placed a rolled lot on his tongue and then on mine.

He mentioned how “sticky” foods could be a delicacy
in other cultures, as I turned my back and coughed them out.

And later in the evening, he read to me about how
indigenous women prevented pregnancy by drinking

cleaver tea, as he handed me a tall cup of it swirling with honey."
"Oh, I’m Dying, I’m Dying,","                                                          the disembodied voice ribs
in the clip of the snake whirlpooling itself to a fake death.
            Blech, she belches, blepp,
as the faux-bra scrapes, underside-up along the grass, forked
                                                          tongue trailing the coil. Oh,
I’m dead—but we know it’s not. The touch-me-not gapes
            its mouth long enough
to be patted again by the cowgirl who runs one finger a length
                                                          of ventral scales. With shit
it musks itself, sometimes punctures a bleed in its commitment
            to being left alone.
I rewind to the seconds of its resurrection, when it flips to flee,
                                                          and pause to admire its hog-
nose of a snout, upturned and useful, subtle shovel in the plot."
