A Line-storm Song,"The line-storm clouds fly tattered and swift, 
  The road is forlorn all day, 
Where a myriad snowy quartz stones lift, 
  And the hoof-prints vanish away. 
The roadside flowers, too wet for the bee,
  Expend their bloom in vain. 
Come over the hills and far with me, 
  And be my love in the rain. 
The birds have less to say for themselves 
  In the wood-world’s torn despair
Than now these numberless years the elves, 
  Although they are no less there: 
All song of the woods is crushed like some 
  Wild, easily shattered rose. 
Come, be my love in the wet woods; come,
  Where the boughs rain when it blows. 
There is the gale to urge behind 
  And bruit our singing down, 
And the shallow waters aflutter with wind 
  From which to gather your gown.    
What matter if we go clear to the west, 
  And come not through dry-shod? 
For wilding brooch shall wet your breast 
  The rain-fresh goldenrod. 
Oh, never this whelming east wind swells   
  But it seems like the sea’s return 
To the ancient lands where it left the shells 
  Before the age of the fern; 
And it seems like the time when after doubt 
  Our love came back amain.      
Oh, come forth into the storm and rout 
  And be my love in the rain."
The Weary Blues,"Droning a drowsy syncopated tune,
Rocking back and forth to a mellow croon,
     I heard a Negro play.
Down on Lenox Avenue the other night
By the pale dull pallor of an old gas light
     He did a lazy sway . . .
     He did a lazy sway . . .
To the tune o’ those Weary Blues.
With his ebony hands on each ivory key
He made that poor piano moan with melody.
     O Blues!
Swaying to and fro on his rickety stool
He played that sad raggy tune like a musical fool.
     Sweet Blues!
Coming from a black man’s soul.
     O Blues!
In a deep song voice with a melancholy tone
I heard that Negro sing, that old piano moan—
     ""Ain’t got nobody in all this world,
       Ain’t got nobody but ma self.
       I’s gwine to quit ma frownin’
       And put ma troubles on the shelf.""
Thump, thump, thump, went his foot on the floor.
He played a few chords then he sang some more—
     ""I got the Weary Blues
       And I can’t be satisfied.
       Got the Weary Blues
       And can’t be satisfied—
       I ain’t happy no mo’
       And I wish that I had died.""
And far into the night he crooned that tune.
The stars went out and so did the moon.
The singer stopped playing and went to bed
While the Weary Blues echoed through his head.
He slept like a rock or a man that's dead."
Morning in the Burned House,"In the burned house I am eating breakfast.
You understand: there is no house, there is no breakfast,
yet here I am.
The spoon which was melted scrapes against
the bowl which was melted also.
No one else is around.
Where have they gone to, brother and sister,
mother and father? Off along the shore,
perhaps. Their clothes are still on the hangers,
their dishes piled beside the sink,
which is beside the woodstove
with its grate and sooty kettle,
every detail clear,
tin cup and rippled mirror.
The day is bright and songless,
the lake is blue, the forest watchful.
In the east a bank of cloud
rises up silently like dark bread.
I can see the swirls in the oilcloth,
I can see the flaws in the glass,
those flares where the sun hits them.
I can't see my own arms and legs
or know if this is a trap or blessing,
finding myself back here, where everything
in this house has long been over,
kettle and mirror, spoon and bowl,
including my own body,
including the body I had then,
including the body I have now
as I sit at this morning table, alone and happy,
bare child's feet on the scorched floorboards
(I can almost see)
in my burning clothes, the thin green shorts
and grubby yellow T-shirt
holding my cindery, non-existent,
radiant flesh. Incandescent."
On Living,"I
Living is no laughing matter:
 you must live with great seriousness
  like a squirrel, for example—
   I mean without looking for something beyond and above living,
  I mean living must be your whole occupation.
Living is no laughing matter:
 you must take it seriously,
 so much so and to such a degree
   that, for example, your hands tied behind your back,
                                            your back to the wall,
   or else in a laboratory
 in your white coat and safety glasses,
 you can die for people—
   even for people whose faces you’ve never seen,
   even though you know living
 is the most real, the most beautiful thing.
I mean, you must take living so seriously
   that even at seventy, for example, you’ll plant olive trees—
   and not for your children, either,
   but because although you fear death you don’t believe it,
   because living, I mean, weighs heavier.
II
Let’s say we’re seriously ill, need surgery—
which is to say we might not get up
   from the white table.
Even though it’s impossible not to feel sad
   about going a little too soon,
we’ll still laugh at the jokes being told,
we’ll look out the window to see if it’s raining,
or still wait anxiously
  for the latest newscast. . . 
Let’s say we’re at the front—
 for something worth fighting for, say.
There, in the first offensive, on that very day,
 we might fall on our face, dead.
We’ll know this with a curious anger,
        but we’ll still worry ourselves to death
        about the outcome of the war, which could last years.
Let’s say we’re in prison
and close to fifty,
and we have eighteen more years, say,
                        before the iron doors will open.
We’ll still live with the outside,
with its people and animals, struggle and wind—
                                I  mean with the outside beyond the walls.
I mean, however and wherever we are,
        we must live as if we will never die.
III
This earth will grow cold,
a star among stars
               and one of the smallest,
a gilded mote on blue velvet—
   I mean this, our great earth.
This earth will grow cold one day,
not like a block of ice
or a dead cloud even 
but like an empty walnut it will roll along
   in pitch-black space . . . 
You must grieve for this right now
—you have to feel this sorrow now—
for the world must be loved this much
                               if you’re going to say “I lived”. . ."
I Could Be a Whale Shark,"                     Bolinao, Philippines
 I am worried about tentacles.
How you can still get stung
even if the jelly arm disconnects
from the bell. My husband
swims without me—farther
out to sea than I would like,
buoyed by salt and rind of kelp.
I am worried if I step too far
into the China Sea, my baby
will slow the beautiful kicks
he has just begun since we landed.
The quickening, they call it, 
but all I am is slow, a moon jelly
floating like a bag in the sea.
Or a whale shark. Yes—I could be
a whale shark, newly spotted
with moles from the pregnancy—
my wide mouth always open
to eat and eat with a look that says
Surprise! Did I eat that much?
When I sleep, I am a flutefish,
just lying there, swaying back
and forth among the kelpy mess
of sheets. You can see the wet
of my dark eye awake, awake. 
My husband is a pale blur 
near the horizon, full of adobo
and not waiting thirty minutes 
before swimming. He is free
and waves at me as he backstrokes
past. This is how he prepares
for fatherhood. Such tenderness
still lingers in the air: the Roman
poet Virgil gave his pet fly
the most lavish funeral, complete
with meat feast and barrels 
of oaky wine. You can never know
where or why you hear
a humming on this soft earth.

"Batter my heart, three person'd God (Holy Sonnet 14)","Batter my heart, three-personed God, for you
As yet but knock, breathe, shine, and seek to mend;
That I may rise, and stand, o'erthrow me, and bend
Your force to break, blow, burn, and make me new.
I, like an usurped town, to another due,
Labour to admit you, but Oh, to no end.
Reason, your viceroy in me, me should defend,
But is captived, and proves weak or untrue.
Yet dearly I love you, and would be loved fain,
But am betrothed unto your enemy:
Divorce me, untie or break that knot again,
Take me to you, imprison me, for I,
Except you enthrall me, never shall be free,
Nor ever chaste, except you ravish me."
Theme for English B,"The instructor said,
    Go home and write
    a page tonight.
    And let that page come out of you—
    Then, it will be true.
I wonder if it's that simple?
I am twenty-two, colored, born in Winston-Salem.
I went to school there, then Durham, then here
to this college on the hill above Harlem.
I am the only colored student in my class.
The steps from the hill lead down into Harlem,
through a park, then I cross St. Nicholas,
Eighth Avenue, Seventh, and I come to the Y,
the Harlem Branch Y, where I take the elevator
up to my room, sit down, and write this page:
It's not easy to know what is true for you or me
at twenty-two, my age. But I guess I'm what
I feel and see and hear, Harlem, I hear you:
hear you, hear me—we two—you, me, talk on this page.
(I hear New York, too.) Me—who?
Well, I like to eat, sleep, drink, and be in love.
I like to work, read, learn, and understand life.
I like a pipe for a Christmas present,
or records—Bessie, bop, or Bach.
I guess being colored doesn't make me not like
the same things other folks like who are other races.
So will my page be colored that I write?
Being me, it will not be white.
But it will be
a part of you, instructor.
You are white—
yet a part of me, as I am a part of you.
That's American.
Sometimes perhaps you don't want to be a part of me.
Nor do I often want to be a part of you.
But we are, that's true!
As I learn from you,
I guess you learn from me—
although you're older—and white—
and somewhat more free.
This is my page for English B."
The Negro Speaks of Rivers,"I've known rivers:
I've known rivers ancient as the world and older than the
     flow of human blood in human veins.
My soul has grown deep like the rivers.
I bathed in the Euphrates when dawns were young.
I built my hut near the Congo and it lulled me to sleep.
I looked upon the Nile and raised the pyramids above it.
I heard the singing of the Mississippi when Abe Lincoln
     went down to New Orleans, and I've seen its muddy
     bosom turn all golden in the sunset.
I've known rivers:
Ancient, dusky rivers.
My soul has grown deep like the rivers."
Throwing Children,It is really something when a kid who has a hard time becomes a kid who’s having a good time in no small part thanks to you throwing that kid in the air again and again on a mile long walk home from the Indian joint as her mom looks sideways at you like you don’t need to keep doing this because you’re pouring with sweat and breathing a little bit now you’re getting a good workout but because the kid laughs like a horse up there laughs like a kangaroo beating her wings against the light because she laughs like a happy little kid and when coming down and grabbing your forearm to brace herself for the time when you will drop her which you don’t and slides her hand into yours as she says for the fortieth time the fiftieth time inexhaustible her delight again again again and again and you say give me til the redbud tree or give me til the persimmon tree because she knows the trees and so quiet you almost can’t hear through her giggles she says ok til the next tree when she explodes howling yanking your arm from the socket again again all the wolves and mourning doves flying from her tiny throat and you throw her so high she lives up there in the tree for a minute she notices the ants organizing on the bark and a bumblebee carousing the little unripe persimmon in its beret she laughs and laughs as she hovers up there like a bumblebee like a hummingbird up there giggling in the light like a giddy little girl up there the world knows how to love.
Poem [Lana Turner has collapsed!],"Lana Turner has collapsed!
I was trotting along and suddenly
it started raining and snowing
and you said it was hailing
but hailing hits you on the head
hard so it was really snowing and
raining and I was in such a hurry
to meet you but the traffic
was acting exactly like the sky
and suddenly I see a headline
LANA TURNER HAS COLLAPSED!
there is no snow in Hollywood
there is no rain in California
I have been to lots of parties
and acted perfectly disgraceful
but I never actually collapsed
oh Lana Turner we love you get up"
Dream Variations,"To fling my arms wide
In some place of the sun,
To whirl and to dance
Till the white day is done.
Then rest at cool evening
Beneath a tall tree
While night comes on gently,
    Dark like me—
That is my dream!
To fling my arms wide
In the face of the sun,
Dance! Whirl! Whirl!
Till the quick day is done.
Rest at pale evening . . .
A tall, slim tree . . .
Night coming tenderly
    Black like me."
In the Waiting Room,"In Worcester, Massachusetts,
I went with Aunt Consuelo
to keep her dentist's appointment
and sat and waited for her
in the dentist's waiting room.
It was winter. It got dark
early. The waiting room
was full of grown-up people,
arctics and overcoats,
lamps and magazines.
My aunt was inside
what seemed like a long time
and while I waited I read
the National Geographic
(I could read) and carefully
studied the photographs:
the inside of a volcano,
black, and full of ashes;
then it was spilling over
in rivulets of fire.
Osa and Martin Johnson
dressed in riding breeches,
laced boots, and pith helmets.
A dead man slung on a pole
--""Long Pig,"" the caption said.
Babies with pointed heads
wound round and round with string;
black, naked women with necks
wound round and round with wire
like the necks of light bulbs.
Their breasts were horrifying.
I read it right straight through.
I was too shy to stop.
And then I looked at the cover:
the yellow margins, the date.
Suddenly, from inside,
came an oh! of pain
--Aunt Consuelo's voice--
not very loud or long.
I wasn't at all surprised;
even then I knew she was
a foolish, timid woman.
I might have been embarrassed,
but wasn't. What took me
completely by surprise
was that it was me:
my voice, in my mouth.
Without thinking at all
I was my foolish aunt,
I--we--were falling, falling,
our eyes glued to the cover
of the National Geographic,
February, 1918.
I said to myself: three days
and you'll be seven years old.
I was saying it to stop
the sensation of falling off
the round, turning world.
into cold, blue-black space.
But I felt: you are an I,
you are an Elizabeth,
you are one of them.
Why should you be one, too?
I scarcely dared to look
to see what it was I was.
I gave a sidelong glance
--I couldn't look any higher--
at shadowy gray knees,
trousers and skirts and boots
and different pairs of hands
lying under the lamps.
I knew that nothing stranger
had ever happened, that nothing
stranger could ever happen.
Why should I be my aunt,
or me, or anyone?
What similarities--
boots, hands, the family voice
I felt in my throat, or even
the National Geographic
and those awful hanging breasts--
held us all together
or made us all just one?
How--I didn't know any
word for it--how ""unlikely"". . .
How had I come to be here,
like them, and overhear
a cry of pain that could have
got loud and worse but hadn't?
The waiting room was bright
and too hot. It was sliding
beneath a big black wave,
another, and another.
Then I was back in it.
The War was on. Outside,
in Worcester, Massachusetts,
were night and slush and cold,
and it was still the fifth
of February, 1918."
[The cry of the cicada],"The cry of the cicada
Gives us no sign
That presently it will die.
                                                  —Translation by William George Aston"
At the Zoo,"First I saw the white bear, then I saw the black;
Then I saw the camel with a hump upon his back;
Then I saw the grey wolf, with mutton in his maw;
Then I saw the wombat waddle in the straw;
Then I saw the elephant a-waving of his trunk;
Then I saw the monkeys—mercy, how unpleasantly they smelt!"
Dear March—Come in—(1320),"Dear March—Come in—
How glad I am—
I hoped for you before—
Put down your Hat—
You must have walked—
How out of Breath you are—
Dear March, how are you, and the Rest—
Did you leave Nature well—
Oh March, Come right upstairs with me—
I have so much to tell—
I got your Letter, and the Birds—
The Maples never knew that you were coming—
I declare - how Red their Faces grew—
But March, forgive me—
And all those Hills you left for me to Hue—
There was no Purple suitable—
You took it all with you—
Who knocks? That April—
Lock the Door—
I will not be pursued—
He stayed away a Year to call
When I am occupied—
But trifles look so trivial
As soon as you have come
That blame is just as dear as Praise
And Praise as mere as Blame—"
Haunted Houses,"All houses wherein men have lived and died
Are haunted houses. Through the open doors
The harmless phantoms on their errands glide,
With feet that make no sound upon the floors.
We meet them at the door-way, on the stair,
Along the passages they come and go,
Impalpable impressions on the air,
A sense of something moving to and fro.
There are more guests at table than the hosts
Invited; the illuminated hall
Is thronged with quiet, inoffensive ghosts,
As silent as the pictures on the wall.
The stranger at my fireside cannot see
The forms I see, nor hear the sounds I hear;
He but perceives what is; while unto me
All that has been is visible and clear.
We have no title-deeds to house or lands;
Owners and occupants of earlier dates
From graves forgotten stretch their dusty hands,
And hold in mortmain still their old estates.
The spirit-world around this world of sense
Floats like an atmosphere, and everywhere
Wafts through these earthly mists and vapours dense
A vital breath of more ethereal air.
Our little lives are kept in equipoise
By opposite attractions and desires;
The struggle of the instinct that enjoys,
And the more noble instinct that aspires.
These perturbations, this perpetual jar
Of earthly wants and aspirations high,
Come from the influence of an unseen star
An undiscovered planet in our sky.
And as the moon from some dark gate of cloud
Throws o’er the sea a floating bridge of light,
Across whose trembling planks our fancies crowd
Into the realm of mystery and night,—
So from the world of spirits there descends
A bridge of light, connecting it with this,
O'er whose unsteady floor, that sways and bends,
Wander our thoughts above the dark abyss."
Halloween,"Upon that night, when fairies light
On Cassilis Downans dance,
Or owre the lays, in splendid blaze,
On sprightly coursers prance;
Or for Colean the route is ta'en,
Beneath the moon's pale beams;
There, up the cove, to stray and rove,
Among the rocks and streams
To sport that night.
Among the bonny winding banks,
Where Doon rins, wimplin' clear,
Where Bruce ance ruled the martial ranks,
And shook his Carrick spear,
Some merry, friendly, country-folks,
Together did convene,
To burn their nits, and pou their stocks,
And haud their Halloween
Fu' blithe that night.
The lasses feat, and cleanly neat,
Mair braw than when they're fine;
Their faces blithe, fu' sweetly kythe,
Hearts leal, and warm, and kin';
The lads sae trig, wi' wooer-babs,
Weel knotted on their garten,
Some unco blate, and some wi' gabs,
Gar lasses' hearts gang startin'
Whiles fast at night.
Then, first and foremost, through the kail,
Their stocks maun a' be sought ance;
They steek their een, and graip and wale,
For muckle anes and straught anes.
Poor hav'rel Will fell aff the drift,
And wander'd through the bow-kail,
And pou't, for want o' better shift,
A runt was like a sow-tail,
Sae bow't that night.
Then, staught or crooked, yird or nane,
They roar and cry a' throu'ther;
The very wee things, todlin', rin,
Wi' stocks out owre their shouther;
And gif the custoc's sweet or sour.
Wi' joctelegs they taste them;
Syne cozily, aboon the door,
Wi cannie care, they've placed them
To lie that night.
The lasses staw frae 'mang them a'
To pou their stalks of corn:
But Rab slips out, and jinks about,
Behint the muckle thorn:
He grippet Nelly hard and fast;
Loud skirl'd a' the lasses;
But her tap-pickle maist was lost,
When kitlin' in the fause-house
Wi' him that night.
The auld guidwife's well-hoordit nits,
Are round and round divided,
And monie lads' and lasses' fates
Are there that night decided:
Some kindle coothie, side by side,
And burn thegither trimly;
Some start awa, wi' saucy pride,
And jump out-owre the chimlie
Fu' high that night.
Jean slips in twa wi' tentie ee;
Wha 'twas she wadna tell;
But this is Jock, and this is me,
She says in to hersel:
He bleezed owre her, and she owre him,
As they wad never mair part;
Till, fuff! he started up the lum,
And Jean had e'en a sair heart
To see't that night.
Poor Willie, wi' his bow-kail runt,
Was brunt wi' primsie Mallie;
And Mallie, nae doubt, took the drunt,
To be compared to Willie;
Mall's nit lap out wi' pridefu' fling,
And her ain fit it brunt it;
While Willie lap, and swore by jing,
'Twas just the way he wanted
To be that night.
Nell had the fause-house in her min',
She pits hersel and Rob in;
In loving bleeze they sweetly join,
Till white in ase they're sobbin';
Nell's heart was dancin' at the view,
She whisper'd Rob to leuk for't:
Rob, stowlins, prie'd her bonny mou',
Fu' cozie in the neuk for't,
Unseen that night.
But Merran sat behint their backs,
Her thoughts on Andrew Bell;
She lea'es them gashin' at their cracks,
And slips out by hersel:
She through the yard the nearest taks,
And to the kiln goes then,
And darklins graipit for the bauks,
And in the blue-clue throws then,
Right fear't that night.
And aye she win't, and aye she swat,
I wat she made nae jaukin',
Till something held within the pat,
Guid Lord! but she was quakin'!
But whether 'was the deil himsel,
Or whether 'twas a bauk-en',
Or whether it was Andrew Bell,
She didna wait on talkin'
To spier that night.
Wee Jennie to her grannie says,
""Will ye go wi' me, grannie?
I'll eat the apple at the glass
I gat frae Uncle Johnnie:""
She fuff't her pipe wi' sic a lunt,
In wrath she was sae vap'rin',
She notice't na, an aizle brunt
Her braw new worset apron
Out through that night.
""Ye little skelpie-limmer's face!
I daur you try sic sportin',
As seek the foul thief ony place,
For him to spae your fortune.
Nae doubt but ye may get a sight!
Great cause ye hae to fear it;
For mony a ane has gotten a fright,
And lived and died deleeret
On sic a night.
""Ae hairst afore the Sherramoor, —
I mind't as weel's yestreen,
I was a gilpey then, I'm sure
I wasna past fifteen;
The simmer had been cauld and wat,
And stuff was unco green;
And aye a rantin' kirn we gat,
And just on Halloween
It fell that night.
""Our stibble-rig was Rab M'Graen,
A clever sturdy fallow:
His son gat Eppie Sim wi' wean,
That lived in Achmacalla:
He gat hemp-seed, I mind it weel,
And he made unco light o't;
But mony a day was by himsel,
He was sae sairly frighted
That very night.""
Then up gat fechtin' Jamie Fleck,
And he swore by his conscience,
That he could saw hemp-seed a peck;
For it was a' but nonsense.
The auld guidman raught down the pock,
And out a hanfu' gied him;
Syne bade him slip frae 'mang the folk,
Some time when nae ane see'd him,
And try't that night.
He marches through amang the stacks,
Though he was something sturtin;
The graip he for a harrow taks.
And haurls it at his curpin;
And every now and then he says,
""Hemp-seed, I saw thee,
And her that is to be my lass,
Come after me, and draw thee
As fast this night.""
He whistled up Lord Lennox' march
To keep his courage cheery;
Although his hair began to arch,
He was say fley'd and eerie:
Till presently he hears a squeak,
And then a grane and gruntle;
He by his shouther gae a keek,
And tumbled wi' a wintle
Out-owre that night.
He roar'd a horrid murder-shout,
In dreadfu' desperation!
And young and auld came runnin' out
To hear the sad narration;
He swore 'twas hilchin Jean M'Craw,
Or crouchie Merran Humphie,
Till, stop! she trotted through them
And wha was it but grumphie
Asteer that night!
Meg fain wad to the barn hae gaen,
To win three wechts o' naething;
But for to meet the deil her lane,
She pat but little faith in:
She gies the herd a pickle nits,
And two red-cheekit apples,
To watch, while for the barn she sets,
In hopes to see Tam Kipples
That very nicht.
She turns the key wi cannie thraw,
And owre the threshold ventures;
But first on Sawnie gies a ca'
Syne bauldly in she enters:
A ratton rattled up the wa',
And she cried, Lord, preserve her!
And ran through midden-hole and a',
And pray'd wi' zeal and fervour,
Fu' fast that night;
They hoy't out Will wi' sair advice;
They hecht him some fine braw ane;
It chanced the stack he faddom'd thrice
Was timmer-propt for thrawin';
He taks a swirlie, auld moss-oak,
For some black grousome carlin;
And loot a winze, and drew a stroke,
Till skin in blypes cam haurlin'
Aff's nieves that night.
A wanton widow Leezie was,
As canty as a kittlin;
But, och! that night amang the shaws,
She got a fearfu' settlin'!
She through the whins, and by the cairn,
And owre the hill gaed scrievin,
Whare three lairds' lands met at a burn
To dip her left sark-sleeve in,
Was bent that night.
Whyles owre a linn the burnie plays,
As through the glen it wimpl't;
Whyles round a rocky scaur it strays;
Whyles in a wiel it dimpl't;
Whyles glitter'd to the nightly rays,
Wi' bickering, dancing dazzle;
Whyles cookit underneath the braes,
Below the spreading hazel,
Unseen that night.
Among the brackens, on the brae,
Between her and the moon,
The deil, or else an outler quey,
Gat up and gae a croon:
Poor Leezie's heart maist lap the hool!
Near lav'rock-height she jumpit;
but mist a fit, and in the pool
Out-owre the lugs she plumpit,
Wi' a plunge that night.
In order, on the clean hearth-stane,
The luggies three are ranged,
And every time great care is ta'en',
To see them duly changed:
Auld Uncle John, wha wedlock joys
Sin' Mar's year did desire,
Because he gat the toom dish thrice,
He heaved them on the fire
In wrath that night.
Wi' merry sangs, and friendly cracks,
I wat they didna weary;
And unco tales, and funny jokes,
Their sports were cheap and cheery;
Till butter'd so'ns, wi' fragrant lunt,
Set a' their gabs a-steerin';
Syne, wi' a social glass o' strunt,
They parted aff careerin'
Fu' blythe that night."
The moon rose over the bay. I had a lot of feelings.,"I am taken with the hot animal
of my skin, grateful to swing my limbs
and have them move as I intend, though
my knee, though my shoulder, though something
is torn or tearing. Today, a dozen squid, dead
on the harbor beach: one mostly buried,
one with skin empty as a shell and hollow
feeling, and, though the tentacles look soft,
I do not touch them. I imagine they
were startled to find themselves in the sun.
I imagine the tide simply went out
without them. I imagine they cannot
feel the black flies charting the raised hills
of their eyes. I write my name in the sand:
Donika Kelly. I watch eighteen seagulls
skim the sandbar and lift low in the sky.
I pick up a pebble that looks like a green egg.
To the ditch lily I say I am in love.
To the Jeep parked haphazardly on the narrow
street I am in love. To the roses, white
petals rimmed brown, to the yellow lined
pavement, to the house trimmed in gold I am
in love. I shout with the rough calculus
of walking. Just let me find my way back,
let me move like a tide come in."
Christmas Bells,"I heard the bells on Christmas Day
Their old, familiar carols play,
    And wild and sweet
    The words repeat
Of peace on earth, good-will to men!
And thought how, as the day had come,
The belfries of all Christendom
    Had rolled along
    The unbroken song
Of peace on earth, good-will to men!
Till ringing, singing on its way,
The world revolved from night to day,
    A voice, a chime,
    A chant sublime
Of peace on earth, good-will to men!
Then from each black, accursed mouth
The cannon thundered in the South,
    And with the sound
    The carols drowned
Of peace on earth, good-will to men!
It was as if an earthquake rent
The hearth-stones of a continent,
    And made forlorn
    The households born
Of peace on earth, good-will to men!
And in despair I bowed my head;
""There is no peace on earth,"" I said;
    ""For hate is strong,
    And mocks the song
Of peace on earth, good-will to men!""
Then pealed the bells more loud and deep:
""God is not dead, nor doth He sleep;
    The Wrong shall fail,
    The Right prevail,
With peace on earth, good-will to men."""

Transfers the corn-cob pipe from his 
Wry mouth to Jack’s, and everyone

       “8 bells. I cannot sleep, for I am sick 
       with fear, but writing eases fear a little 
       since still my eyes can see these words take shape   
       upon the page & so I write, as one 
       would turn to exorcism. 4 days scudding, 
       but now the sea is calm again. Misfortune 
       follows in our wake like sharks (our grinning   
       tutelary gods). Which one of us 
       has killed an albatross? A plague among 
       our blacks—Ophthalmia: blindness—& we   
       have jettisoned the blind to no avail. 
       It spreads, the terrifying sickness spreads. 
       Its claws have scratched sight from the Capt.'s eyes   
       & there is blindness in the fo’c’sle 
       & we must sail 3 weeks before we come 
       to port.” 
               What port awaits us, Davy Jones’ 
               or home? I’ve heard of slavers drifting, drifting,   
               playthings of wind and storm and chance, their crews   
               gone blind, the jungle hatred 
               crawling up on deck.

       for the barracoons of Florida: 
       “That there was hardly room ’tween-decks for half   
       the sweltering cattle stowed spoon-fashion there;   
       that some went mad of thirst and tore their flesh   
       and sucked the blood: 
       “That Crew and Captain lusted with the comeliest   
       of the savage girls kept naked in the cabins;   
       that there was one they called The Guinea Rose   
       and they cast lots and fought to lie with her: 
       “That when the Bo’s’n piped all hands, the flames   
       spreading from starboard already were beyond   
       control, the negroes howling and their chains   
       entangled with the flames: 
       “That the burning blacks could not be reached,   
       that the Crew abandoned ship, 
       leaving their shrieking negresses behind, 
       that the Captain perished drunken with the wenches: 
       “Further Deponent sayeth not.”

Aye, lad, and I have seen those factories,   
Gambia, Rio Pongo, Calabar; 
have watched the artful mongos baiting traps   
of war wherein the victor and the vanquished 
Were caught as prizes for our barracoons.   
Have seen the nigger kings whose vanity 
and greed turned wild black hides of Fellatah,   
Mandingo, Ibo, Kru to gold for us. 
And there was one—King Anthracite we named him— 
fetish face beneath French parasols 
of brass and orange velvet, impudent mouth 
whose cups were carven skulls of enemies: 
He’d honor us with drum and feast and conjo   
and palm-oil-glistening wenches deft in love,   
and for tin crowns that shone with paste,   
red calico and German-silver trinkets 
Would have the drums talk war and send   
his warriors to burn the sleeping villages   
and kill the sick and old and lead the young   
in coffles to our factories. 
Twenty years a trader, twenty years, 
for there was wealth aplenty to be harvested   
from those black fields, and I’d be trading still   
but for the fevers melting down my bones. 
         III
Shuttles in the rocking loom of history,   
the dark ships move, the dark ships move,   
their bright ironical names 
like jests of kindness on a murderer’s mouth;   
plough through thrashing glister toward   
fata morgana’s lucent melting shore,   
weave toward New World littorals that are   
mirage and myth and actual shore. 
Voyage through death, 
                               voyage whose chartings are unlove. 
A charnel stench, effluvium of living death   
spreads outward from the hold, 
where the living and the dead, the horribly dying,   
lie interlocked, lie foul with blood and excrement. 
       Deep in the festering hold thy father lies,   
       the corpse of mercy rots with him,   
       rats eat love’s rotten gelid eyes. 
       But, oh, the living look at you 
       with human eyes whose suffering accuses you,   
       whose hatred reaches through the swill of dark   
       to strike you like a leper’s claw. 
       You cannot stare that hatred down 
       or chain the fear that stalks the watches 
       and breathes on you its fetid scorching breath;   
       cannot kill the deep immortal human wish,   
       the timeless will.
               “But for the storm that flung up barriers   
               of wind and wave, The Amistad, señores, 
               would have reached the port of Príncipe in two,   
               three days at most; but for the storm we should   
               have been prepared for what befell.   
               Swift as the puma’s leap it came. There was   
               that interval of moonless calm filled only   
               with the water’s and the rigging’s usual sounds,   
               then sudden movement, blows and snarling cries   
               and they had fallen on us with machete   
               and marlinspike. It was as though the very   
               air, the night itself were striking us.   
               Exhausted by the rigors of the storm, 
               we were no match for them. Our men went down   
               before the murderous Africans. Our loyal   
               Celestino ran from below with gun   
               and lantern and I saw, before the cane- 
               knife’s wounding flash, Cinquez, 
               that surly brute who calls himself a prince,   
               directing, urging on the ghastly work. 
               He hacked the poor mulatto down, and then   
               he turned on me. The decks were slippery 
               when daylight finally came. It sickens me   
               to think of what I saw, of how these apes   
               threw overboard the butchered bodies of 
               our men, true Christians all, like so much jetsam.   
               Enough, enough. The rest is quickly told:   
               Cinquez was forced to spare the two of us   
               you see to steer the ship to Africa,   
               and we like phantoms doomed to rove the sea   
               voyaged east by day and west by night,   
               deceiving them, hoping for rescue,   
               prisoners on our own vessel, till   
               at length we drifted to the shores of this   
               your land, America, where we were freed   
               from our unspeakable misery. Now we   
               demand, good sirs, the extradition of   
               Cinquez and his accomplices to La   
               Havana. And it distresses us to know   
               there are so many here who seem inclined   
               to justify the mutiny of these blacks.   
               We find it paradoxical indeed 
               that you whose wealth, whose tree of liberty   
               are rooted in the labor of your slaves 
               should suffer the august John Quincy Adams   
               to speak with so much passion of the right   
               of chattel slaves to kill their lawful masters   
               and with his Roman rhetoric weave a hero’s   
               garland for Cinquez. I tell you that   
               we are determined to return to Cuba 
               with our slaves and there see justice done. Cinquez— 
               or let us say ‘the Prince’—Cinquez shall die.” 
       The deep immortal human wish,   
       the timeless will: 
               Cinquez its deathless primaveral image,   
               life that transfigures many lives. 
       Voyage through death 
                                     to life upon these shores."
One Sister have I in our house (14),"One Sister have I in our house - 
And one a hedge away. 
There's only one recorded, 
But both belong to me. 
  
One came the way that I came -         
And wore my past year's gown - 
The other as a bird her nest, 
Builded our hearts among. 
  
She did not sing as we did - 
It was a different tune -     
Herself to her a Music 
As Bumble-bee of June. 
  
Today is far from Childhood -
But up and down the hills 
I held her hand the tighter -         
Which shortened all the miles - 
  
And still her hum 
The years among, 
Deceives the Butterfly; 
Still in her Eye 
The Violets lie 
Mouldered this many May.         
  
I spilt the dew -
But took the morn, - 
I chose this single star 
From out the wide night's numbers - 
Sue - forevermore!"
Thanksgiving Day,"Over the river, and through the wood,

       The horse knows the way
       To carry the sleigh
  Through the white and drifted snow.
Over the river, and through the wood—
  Oh, how the wind does blow!
       It stings the toes
       And bites the nose
  As over the ground we go.
Over the river, and through the wood,

Over the river, and through the wood
  Trot fast, my dapple-gray!
       Spring over the ground,
       Like a hunting-hound!
  For this is Thanksgiving Day.
Over the river, and through the wood,
  And straight through the barn-yard gate.
       We seem to go
       Extremely slow,—
  It is so hard to wait!
Over the river and through the wood—
  Now grandmother's cap I spy!
       Hurrah for the fun!
       Is the pudding done?
  Hurrah for the pumpkin-pie!"
Thanksgiving,"We walk on starry fields of white
   And do not see the daisies;
For blessings common in our sight

And quite ignore our daily store
   Of pleasures sweet and tender.
Our cares are bold and push their way
   Upon our thought and feeling.
They hand about us all the day,
   Our time from pleasure stealing.
So unobtrusive many a joy
   We pass by and forget it,
But worry strives to own our lives,
   And conquers if we let it.
There’s not a day in all the year
   But holds some hidden pleasure,
And looking back, joys oft appear
   To brim the past’s wide measure.
But blessings are like friends, I hold,
   Who love and labor near us.
We ought to raise our notes of praise
   While living hearts can hear us.
Full many a blessing wears the guise
   Of worry or of trouble;
Far-seeing is the soul, and wise,
   Who knows the mask is double.
But he who has the faith and strength
   To thank his God for sorrow
Has found a joy without alloy
   To gladden every morrow.
We ought to make the moments notes
   Of happy, glad Thanksgiving;
The hours and days a silent phrase
   Of music we are living.
And so the theme should swell and grow
   As weeks and months pass o’er us,
And rise sublime at this good time,
   A grand Thanksgiving chorus."
A Brief History of Hostility,"In the beginning
there was the war.
The war said let there be war
and there was war.
The war said let there be peace
and there was war.
The people said music and rain
evaporating against fire in the brush
was a kind of music
and so was the beast.
The beast that roared
or bleated when brought down
was silent when skinned
but loud after the skin
was pulled taut over wood
and the people said music
and the thump thump
thump said drum.
Someone said
war drum. The drum said war
is coming to meet you in the field.
The field said war
tastes like copper,
said give us some more, said look
at the wild flowers our war plants
in a grove and grows
just for us.
  Outside sheets are pulling
this way and that.
Fields are smoke,
smoke is air.
We wait for fingers to be bent
knuckle to knuckle,
the porch overrun
with rope and shotgun
but the hounds don’t show.
We beat the drum and sing
like there’s nothing outside
but rust-colored clay and fields
of wild flowers growing
farther than we can walk.
Torches may come like fox paws
to steal away what we plant,
but with our bodies bound
by the skin, my arc to his curve,
we are stalks that will bend
and bend and bend…
fire for heat
fire for light
fire for casting figures on a dungeon wall
fire for teaching shadows to writhe
fire for keeping beasts at bay
fire to give them back to the earth
fire for the siege
fire to singe
fire to roast
fire to fuse rubber soles to collapsed crossbeams
fire for Gehenna
fire for Dante
fire for Fallujah
fire for readied aim
fire in the forge that folds steel like a flag
fire to curl worms like cigarette ash
fire to give them back to the earth
fire for ancient reasons: to call down rain
fire to catch it and turn it into steam
fire for churches
fire for a stockpile of books
fire for a bible-black cloak tied to a stake
fire for smoke signals
fire to shape gun muzzle and magazine
fire to leap from the gut of a furnace
fire for Hephaestus
fire for pyres’ sake
fire licking the toes of a quiet brown man
fire for his home
fire for her flag
fire for this sand, to coax it into glass
fire to cure mirrors
fire to cure leeches
Fire to compose a nocturne of cinders
fire for the trash cans illuminating streets
fire for fuel
fire for fields
fire for the field hand’s fourth death
fire to make a cross visible for several yards
fire from the dragon’s mouth
fire for smoking out tangos
fire to stoke like rage and fill the sky with human remains
fire to give them back to the earth
fire to make twine fall from bound wrists
fire to mark them all and bubble black
any flesh it touches as it frees
  They took the light from our eyes. Possessive.
Took the moisture from our throats. My arms,
my lips, my sternum, sucked dry, and
lovers of autumn say, Look, here is beauty.
Tallness only made me an obvious target made of
off-kilter limbs. I’d fall either way. I should get a
to-the-death tattoo or metal ribbon of some sort.
War took our prayers like nothing else can,
left us dumber than remote drones. Make
me a loyal soldier and I’ll make you a
lamenting so thick, metallic, so tank-tread-hard.
Now make tomorrow a gate shaped like a man.
I can’t promise, when it’s time, I won’t hesitate,
cannot say I won’t forget to return in fall and
guess the names of the leaves before they change.
  The war said bring us your dead
and we died. The people said music
and bending flower, so we sang ballads
in the aisles of churches and fruit markets.
The requiem was everywhere: a comet’s tail
disappearing into the atmosphere,
the wide mouths of the bereft men that have sung…
On currents of air, seeds were carried
as the processional carried us
through the streets of a forgetting city,
between the cold iron of gates.
The field said soil is rich wherever we fall.
Aren’t graveyards and battlefields
our most efficient gardens?
Journeys begin there too if the flowers are taken
into account, and shouldn’t we always
take the flowers into account? Bring them to us.
We’ll come back to you. Peace will come to you
as a rosewood-colored road paver
in your grandmother’s town, as a trench
scraped into canvas, as a violin bow, a shovel,
an easel, a brushstroke that covers
burial mounds in grass. And love, you say,
is a constant blade, a trowel that plants
and uproots, and tomorrow
will be a tornado, you say. Then war,
a sick wind, will come to part the air,
straighten your suit,
and place fresh flowers
on all our muddy graves."
For My People,"For my people everywhere singing their slave songs
     repeatedly: their dirges and their ditties and their blues 
     and jubilees, praying their prayers nightly to an
     unknown god, bending their knees humbly to an
     unseen power;
For my people lending their strength to the years, to the 
    gone years and the now years and the maybe years,
    washing ironing cooking scrubbing sewing mending
    hoeing plowing digging planting pruning patching
    dragging along never gaining never reaping never
    knowing and never understanding;
For my playmates in the clay and dust and sand of Alabama
    backyards playing baptizing and preaching and doctor
    and jail and soldier and school and mama and cooking
    and playhouse and concert and store and hair and Miss
    Choomby and company;
For the cramped bewildered years we went to school to learn 
    to know the reasons why and the answers to and the
    people who and the places where and the days when, in
    memory of the bitter hours when we discovered we
    were black and poor and small and different and nobody
    cared and nobody wondered and nobody understood;
For the boys and girls who grew in spite of these things to
    be man and woman, to laugh and dance and sing and
    play and drink their wine and religion and success, to
    marry their playmates and bear children and then die
    of consumption and anemia and lynching;
For my people thronging 47th Street in Chicago and Lenox
    Avenue in New York and Rampart Street in New
    Orleans, lost disinherited dispossessed and happy
    people filling the cabarets and taverns and other
    people’s pockets needing bread and shoes and milk and
    land and money and something—something all our own;
For my people walking blindly spreading joy, losing time
     being lazy, sleeping when hungry, shouting when
     burdened, drinking when hopeless, tied, and shackled
     and tangled among ourselves by the unseen creatures
     who tower over us omnisciently and laugh;
For my people blundering and groping and floundering in
     the dark of churches and schools and clubs and
     societies, associations and councils and committees and 
     conventions, distressed and disturbed and deceived and
     devoured by money-hungry glory-craving leeches,
     preyed on by facile force of state and fad and novelty, by
     false prophet and holy believer;
For my people standing staring trying to fashion a better way
    from confusion, from hypocrisy and misunderstanding,
    trying to fashion a world that will hold all the people,
    all the faces, all the adams and eves and their countless
    generations;
Let a new earth rise. Let another world be born. Let a
    bloody peace be written in the sky. Let a second
    generation full of courage issue forth; let a people
    loving freedom come to growth. Let a beauty full of
    healing and a strength of final clenching be the pulsing
    in our spirits and our blood. Let the martial songs
    be written, let the dirges disappear. Let a race of men now 
    rise and take control."
Vaccinated,"I once saw Jazell Barbie Royale
Do Whitney Houston so well
I got upset with myself for sneaking 
Past the cashier 
After having been patted down. Security frisks you 
For nothing. They don’t believe in trouble. They don’t 
Imagine a gun or a blade, though
Sometimes they make you walk all the way back 
To the car with the weed you didn’t tuck well.
No one’s at fault. That’s how they say it
Where I’m from. Everyone’s got a job. 
I should have paid. Our women
Need to perform for the tips they couldn’t earn
After the state shut down for good reason 
And too late. We lost so many friends. 
My buddy Janir swears 
He still can’t smell his lip balm. Our women need us 
To call them beautiful 
Because they are. They’ve done what they must
To prove it, and how often does any woman get
To hear the truth? Jazell is so pretty.
Whitney Houston is dead. No one wore a mask.
It wasn’t safe, so it wasn’t really free.
If you don’t watch me, I’ll get by you. I’ll take
What I’ve been missing. My mother says 
That’s not how she raised me. I spent 
A year and a half sure she’d die.
The women who lip sync for us could die.
People like to murder them, 
And almost everyone else wonders
If they should be dead. Who got dressed looking 
For safety today? Who got patted down?  My mother 
Says what we do is sin. But all we do 
Is party. Even when I’m broke, I can 
Entertain. You’re going to miss me some day. 
You’re going to forget the words to your favorite song. 
You’re going to miss me when I’m gone."
"To the Virgins, to Make Much of Time","Gather ye rosebuds while ye may,
   Old Time is still a-flying;
And this same flower that smiles today
   Tomorrow will be dying.
The glorious lamp of heaven, the sun,
   The higher he's a-getting,
The sooner will his race be run,
   And nearer he's to setting.
That age is best which is the first,
   When youth and blood are warmer;
But being spent, the worse, and worst
   Times still succeed the former.
Then be not coy, but use your time,
   And while ye may, go marry;
For having lost but once your prime,
   You may forever tarry."
Leda and the Swan,"A sudden blow: the great wings beating still
Above the staggering girl, her thighs caressed
By the dark webs, her nape caught in his bill,
He holds her helpless breast upon his breast.
How can those terrified vague fingers push
The feathered glory from her loosening thighs?
And how can body, laid in that white rush,
But feel the strange heart beating where it lies?
A shudder in the loins engenders there
The broken wall, the burning roof and tower
And Agamemnon dead.
                    Being so caught up,
So mastered by the brute blood of the air,
Did she put on his knowledge with his power
Before the indifferent beak could let her drop?"
To make a prairie (1755),"To make a prairie it takes a clover and one bee,
One clover, and a bee.
And revery.
The revery alone will do,
If bees are few."
A Christmas Carol,"In the bleak mid-winter
   Frosty wind made moan,
Earth stood hard as iron,
   Water like a stone;
Snow had fallen, snow on snow,
   Snow on snow,
In the bleak mid-winter 
   Long ago.

Our God, Heaven cannot hold Him
   Nor earth sustain;
Heaven and earth shall flee away
   When He comes to reign:
In the bleak midwinter
   A stable-place sufficed
The Lord God Almighty
   Jesus Christ.

Enough for Him, whom cherubim
   Worship night and day,
A breastful of milk
   And a mangerful of hay;
Enough for Him, whom angels
   Fall down before,
The ox and ass and camel
   Which adore.

Angels and archangels
   May have gathered there,
Cherubim and seraphim
   Thronged the air;
But only His mother
   In her maiden bliss
Worshipped the Beloved
   With a kiss.

What can I give Him,
   Poor as I am?
If I were a shepherd
   I would bring a lamb,
If I were a Wise Man
   I would do my part,—
Yet what I can I give Him,
   Give my heart."
Coherence in Consequence,"Imagine them in black, the morning heat losing within this day that floats. And always there is the being, and the not-seeing on their way to—
The days they approach and their sharpest aches will wrap experience until knowledge is translucent, the frost on which they find themselves slipping. Never mind the loose mindless grip of their forms reflected in the eye-watering hues of the surface, these two will survive in their capacity to meet, to hold the other beneath the plummeting, in the depths below each step full of avoidance. What they create will be held up, will resume: the appetite is bigger than joy. indestructible. for never was it independent from who they are. who will be.
Were we ever to arrive at knowing the other as the same pulsing compassion would break the most orthodox heart."
Let Them Not Say,"Let them not say:   we did not see it.
We saw.
Let them not say:   we did not hear it.
We heard.
Let them not say:     they did not taste it.
We ate, we trembled.
Let them not say:   it was not spoken, not written.
We spoke,
we witnessed with voices and hands.
Let them not say:     they did nothing.
We did not-enough.
Let them say, as they must say something: 
A kerosene beauty.
It burned.
Let them say we warmed ourselves by it,
read by its light, praised,
and it burned.

What I Am,"Fred Sanford's on at 12
& I'm standing in the express lane (cash only)
about to buy Head & Shoulders
the white people shampoo, no one knows
what I am. My name could be Lamont.
George Clinton wears colors like Toucan Sam,
the Froot Loop pelican. Follow your nose,
he says. But I have no nose, no mouth,
so you tell me what's good, what's god,
what's funky. When I stop
by McDonalds for a cheeseburger, no one
suspects what I am. I smile at Ronald's poster,
perpetual grin behind the pissed-off, fly-girl
cashier I love. Where are my goddamn fries?
Ain't I American? I never say, Niggaz
in my poems. My ancestors didn't
emigrate. Why would anyone leave
their native land? I'm thinking about shooting
some hoop later on. I'll dunk on everyone
of those niggaz. They have no idea
what I am. I might be the next Jordan
god. They don't know if Toni Morrison
is a woman or a man. Michael Jackson
is the biggest name in showbiz. Mamma se 
Mamma sa mamma ku sa, sang the Bushmen 
in Africa. I'll buy a dimebag after the game, 
me & Jody. He says, Fuck them white people 
at work, Man. He was an All-American 
in high school. He's cool, but he don't know 
what I am, & so what. Fred Sanford's on 
in a few & I got the dandruff-free head 
& shoulders of white people & a cheeseburger 
belly & a Thriller CD & Nike high tops 
& slavery's dead & the TV's my daddy-- 
   You big Dummy!

We Should Make a Documentary About Spades,"And here is all we’ll need: a card deck, quartets of sun people
Of the sort found in black college dormitories, some vintage
Music, indiscriminate spirits, fried chicken, some paper,

A writing utensil, and a bottomless Saturday. We should explore
The origins of a derogatory word like spade as well as the word
For feeling alone in polite company. And also the implications
Of calling someone who is not your brother or sister,

Brother or Sister. So little is known of our past, we can imagine
Damn near anything. When I say maybe slaves held Spades
Tournaments on the anti-cruise ships bound for the Colonies,
You say when our ancestors were cooped on those ships

They were not yet slaves. Our groundbreaking film should begin
With a low-lit den in the Deep South and the deep fried voice
Of somebody’s grandmother holding smoke in her mouth
As she says, “The two of Diamonds trumps the two of Spades

In my house.” And at some point someone should tell the story
Where Jesus and the devil are Spades partners traveling
The juke joints of the 1930s. We could interview my uncle Junior
And definitely your skinny cousin Mary and any black man

Sitting at a card table wearing shades. Who do you suppose
Would win if Booker T and MLK were matched against Du Bois
And Malcolm X in a game of Spades? You say don’t talk
Across the table. Pay attention to the suits being played.

The object of the game is to communicate invisibly
With your teammate. I should concentrate. Do you suppose
We are here because we are lonely in some acute diasporafied
Way? This should be explored in our film about Spades.

Because it is one of the ways I am still learning what it is
To be black, tonight I am ready to master Spades. Four players
Bid a number of books. Each team adds the bids
Of the two partners, and the total is the number of books

That team must try to win. Is that not right? This is a game
That tests the boundary between mathematics and magic,
If you ask me. A bid must be intuitive like the itchiness
Of the your upper lip before you sip strange whiskey.

My mother did not drink, which is how I knew something
Was wrong with her, but she held a dry spot at the table
When couples came to play. It’s a scene from my history,
But this probably should not be mentioned in our documentary

About Spades. Renege is akin to the word for the shame
You feel watching someone else’s humiliation. Slapping
A card down must be as dramatic as hitting the face of a drum
With your palm, not hitting the face of a drum with a drumstick.

You say there may be the sort of outrage induced
By liquor, trash talk, and poor strategy, but it will fade
The way a watermark left on a table by a cold glass fades.
I suspect winning this sort of game makes you feel godly.

I’m good and ready for who ever we’re playing
Against tonight. I am trying to imagine our enemy.
I know you are not my enemy. You say there are no enemies
In Spades. Spades is a game our enemies do not play."
Christmas Carol,"   Ring out, ye bells!
   All Nature swells
With gladness at the wondrous story,—
   The world was lorn,
   But Christ is born
To change our sadness into glory.

   Sing, earthlings, sing!
   To-night a King
Hath come from heaven's high throne to bless us.
   The outstretched hand
   O'er all the land
Is raised in pity to caress us.

   Come at his call;
   Be joyful all;
Away with mourning and with sadness!
   The heavenly choir
   With holy fire
Their voices raise in songs of gladness.

   The darkness breaks
   And Dawn awakes,
Her cheeks suffused with youthful blushes.
   The rocks and stones
   In holy tones
Are singing sweeter than the thrushes.

   Then why should we
   In silence be,
When Nature lends her voice to praises;
   When heaven and earth
   Proclaim the truth
Of Him for whom that lone star blazes?

   No, be not still,
   But with a will
Strike all your harps and set them ringing;
   On hill and heath
   Let every breath
Throw all its power into singing!"
The Owl and the Pussy-Cat,"The Owl and the Pussy-Cat went to sea
   In a beautiful pea-green boat:
They took some honey, and plenty of money
   Wrapped up in a five-pound note.
The Owl looked up to the stars above,
   And sang to a small guitar,
""O lovely Pussy, O Pussy, my love,
   What a beautiful Pussy you are,
            You are,
            You are!
   What a beautiful Pussy you are!""
Pussy said to the Owl, ""You elegant fowl,
   How charmingly sweet you sing!
Oh! let us be married; too long we have tarried,
   But what shall we do for a ring?""
They sailed away, for a year and a day,
To the land where the bong-tree grows;
And there in a wood a Piggy-wig stood,
   With a ring at the end of his nose,
            His nose,
            His nose,
   With a ring at the end of his nose.
""Dear Pig, are you willing to sell for one shilling
   Your ring?"" Said the Piggy, ""I will.""
So they took it away, and were married next day
   By the turkey who lives on the hill.
They dined on mince and slices of quince,
   Which they ate with a runcible spoon;
And hand in hand, on the edge of the sand,
   They danced by the light of the moon,
            The moon,
            The moon,
   They danced by the light of the moon."
A Visit from St. Nicholas,"'Twas the night before Christmas, when all through the house
Not a creature was stirring, not even a mouse;
The stockings were hung by the chimney with care,
In hopes that St. Nicholas soon would be there;
The children were nestled all snug in their beds,
While visions of sugar-plums danced in their heads;
And mamma in her ’kerchief, and I in my cap,
Had just settled our brains for a long winter’s nap,
When out on the lawn there arose such a clatter,
I sprang from the bed to see what was the matter.
Away to the window I flew like a flash,
Tore open the shutters and threw up the sash.
The moon on the breast of the new-fallen snow
Gave the lustre of mid-day to objects below,
When, what to my wondering eyes should appear,
But a miniature sleigh, and eight tiny reindeer,
With a little old driver, so lively and quick,
I knew in a moment it must be St. Nick.
More rapid than eagles his coursers they came,
And he whistled, and shouted, and called them by name;
""Now, Dasher! now, Dancer! now, Prancer and Vixen!
On, Comet! on, Cupid! on, Donder and Blitzen!
To the top of the porch! to the top of the wall!
Now dash away! dash away! dash away all!""
As dry leaves that before the wild hurricane fly,
When they meet with an obstacle, mount to the sky;
So up to the house-top the coursers they flew,
With the sleigh full of Toys, and St. Nicholas too.
And then, in a twinkling, I heard on the roof
The prancing and pawing of each little hoof.
As I drew in my head, and was turning around,
Down the chimney St. Nicholas came with a bound.
He was dressed all in fur, from his head to his foot,
And his clothes were all tarnished with ashes and soot;
A bundle of Toys he had flung on his back,
And he looked like a pedler just opening his pack.
His eyes—how they twinkled! his dimples how merry!
His cheeks were like roses, his nose like a cherry!
His droll little mouth was drawn up like a bow
And the beard of his chin was as white as the snow;
The stump of a pipe he held tight in his teeth,
And the smoke it encircled his head like a wreath;
He had a broad face and a little round belly,
That shook when he laughed, like a bowlful of jelly.
He was chubby and plump, a right jolly old elf,
And I laughed when I saw him, in spite of myself;
A wink of his eye and a twist of his head,
Soon gave me to know I had nothing to dread;
He spoke not a word, but went straight to his work,
And filled all the stockings; then turned with a jerk,
And laying his finger aside of his nose,
And giving a nod, up the chimney he rose;
He sprang to his sleigh, to his team gave a whistle,
And away they all flew like the down of a thistle,
But I heard him exclaim, ere he drove out of sight,
""Happy Christmas to all, and to all a good-night."""
Hurricane,"Four tickets left, I let her go—
Firstborn into a hurricane.
I thought she escaped
The floodwaters. No—but her
Head is empty of the drowned
For now—though she took
Her first breath below sea level.
Ahhh       awe       &       aw
Mama, let me go—she speaks
What every smart child knows—
To get grown you unlatch
Your hands from the grown
& up & up & up & up
She turns—latched in the seat
Of a hurricane. You let
Your girl what? You let
Your girl what?
I did so she do I did
so she do so—
Girl, you can ride
A hurricane & she do
& she do & she do & she do
She do make my river
An ocean. Memorial,
Baptist, Protestant birth—my girl
Walked away from a hurricane.
& she do & she do & she do & she do
She do take my hand a while longer.

On Being Brought from Africa to America,"'Twas mercy brought me from my Pagan land,
Taught my benighted soul to understand
That there's a God, that there's a Saviour too:

""Their colour is a diabolic die.""
Remember, Christians, Negros, black as Cain,
May be refin'd, and join th' angelic train."

Alone,"Lying, thinking
Last night
How to find my soul a home
Where water is not thirsty
And bread loaf is not stone
I came up with one thing
And I don’t believe I’m wrong
That nobody,
But nobody
Can make it out here alone.
Alone, all alone
Nobody, but nobody
Can make it out here alone.
There are some millionaires
With money they can’t use
Their wives run round like banshees
Their children sing the blues
They’ve got expensive doctors
To cure their hearts of stone.
But nobody
No, nobody
Can make it out here alone.
Alone, all alone
Nobody, but nobody
Can make it out here alone.
Now if you listen closely
I'll tell you what I know
Storm clouds are gathering
The wind is gonna blow
The race of man is suffering
And I can hear the moan,
'Cause nobody,
But nobody
Can make it out here alone.
Alone, all alone
Nobody, but nobody
Can make it out here alone."

Lenore,"Ah broken is the golden bowl! the spirit flown forever!
Let the bell toll!--a saintly soul floats on the Stygian river;
And, Guy De Vere, hast thou no tear?--weep now or never more!
See! on yon drear and rigid bier low lies thy love, Lenore!
Come! let the burial rite be read--the funeral song be sung!--
An anthem for the queenliest dead that ever died so young--
A dirge for her the doubly dead in that she died so young.
""Wretches! ye loved her for her wealth and hated her for her pride,
""And when she fell in feeble health, ye blessed her--that she died!
""How shall the ritual, then, be read?--the requiem how be sung
""By you--by yours, the evil eye,--by yours, the slanderous tongue
""That did to death the innocent that died, and died so young?""
Peccavimus; but rave not thus! and let a Sabbath song
Go up to God so solemnly the dead may feel so wrong!
The sweet Lenore hath ""gone before,"" with Hope, that flew beside
Leaving thee wild for the dear child that should have been thy bride--
For her, the fair and debonair, that now so lowly lies,
The life upon her yellow hair but not within her eyes--
The life still there, upon her hair--the death upon her eyes.
""Avaunt! to-night my heart is light. No dirge will I upraise,
""But waft the angel on her flight with a Pæan of old days!
""Let no bell toll!--lest her sweet soul, amid its hallowed mirth,
""Should catch the note, as it doth float up from the damnéd Earth.
""To friends above, from fiends below, the indignant ghost is riven--
""From Hell unto a high estate far up within the Heaven--
""From grief and groan, to a golden throne, beside the King of Heaven."""
[little tree],"little tree
little silent Christmas tree
you are so little
you are more like a flower
who found you in the green forest
and were you very sorry to come away?
see            i will comfort you
because you smell so sweetly
i will kiss your cool bark
and hug you safe and tight
just as your mother would,
only don’t be afraid
look           the spangles
that sleep all the year in a dark box
dreaming of being taken out and allowed to shine,
the balls the chains red and gold the fluffy threads,
put up your little arms
and i’ll give them all to you to hold.
every finger shall have its ring
and there won’t be a single place dark or unhappy
then when you’re quite dressed
you’ll stand in the window for everyone to see
and how they’ll stare!
oh but you’ll be very proud
and my little sister and i will take hands
and looking up at our beautiful tree
we’ll dance and sing
“Noel Noel”"
Heart to Heart,"It’s neither red
nor sweet.
It doesn’t melt
or turn over,
break or harden,
so it can’t feel
pain,
yearning,
regret.
It doesn’t have 
a tip to spin on,
it isn’t even
shapely—
just a thick clutch
of muscle,
lopsided,
mute. Still,
I feel it inside
its cage sounding
a dull tattoo:
I want, I want—
but I can’t open it:
there’s no key.
I can’t wear it
on my sleeve,
or tell you from
the bottom of it
how I feel. Here,
it’s all yours, now—
but you’ll have
to take me,
too."
To Autumn,"Season of mists and mellow fruitfulness,
  Close bosom-friend of the maturing sun;
Conspiring with him how to load and bless
  With fruit the vines that round the thatch-eves run;
To bend with apples the moss’d cottage-trees,
  And fill all fruit with ripeness to the core;
    To swell the gourd, and plump the hazel shells
  With a sweet kernel; to set budding more,
And still more, later flowers for the bees,
Until they think warm days will never cease,
    For summer has o’er-brimm’d their clammy cells.
Who hath not seen thee oft amid thy store?
  Sometimes whoever seeks abroad may find
Thee sitting careless on a granary floor,
  Thy hair soft-lifted by the winnowing wind;
Or on a half-reap’d furrow sound asleep,
  Drowsed with the fume of poppies, while thy hook
    Spares the next swath and all its twined flowers:
And sometimes like a gleaner thou dost keep
  Steady thy laden head across a brook;
  Or by a cider-press, with patient look,
    Thou watchest the last oozings, hours by hours.
Where are the songs of Spring? Ay, where are they?
  Think not of them, thou hast thy music too,—
While barred clouds bloom the soft-dying day,
  And touch the stubble-plains with rosy hue;
Then in a wailful choir the small gnats mourn
  Among the river sallows, borne aloft
    Or sinking as the light wind lives or dies;
And full-grown lambs loud bleat from hilly bourn;
  Hedge-crickets sing; and now with treble soft
  The redbreast whistles from a garden-croft,
    And gathering swallows twitter in the skies."
My mistress' eyes are nothing like the sun (Sonnet 130),"My mistress' eyes are nothing like the sun;
Coral is far more red than her lips' red;
If snow be white, why then her breasts are dun;
If hairs be wires, black wires grow on her head.
I have seen roses damasked, red and white,
But no such roses see I in her cheeks;
And in some perfumes is there more delight
Than in the breath that from my mistress reeks.
I love to hear her speak, yet well I know
That music hath a far more pleasing sound;
I grant I never saw a goddess go;
My mistress when she walks treads on the ground.
     And yet, by heaven, I think my love as rare
     As any she belied with false compare."
On Death,"Then Almitra spoke, saying, We would ask now of Death.
    And he said:
    You would know the secret of death.
    But how shall you find it unless you seek it in the heart of life?
    The owl whose night-bound eyes are blind unto the day cannot unveil the mystery of light.
    If you would indeed behold the spirit of death, open your heart wide unto the body of life.
    For life and death are one, even as the river and the sea are one.
    In the depth of your hopes and desires lies your silent knowledge of the beyond;
    And like seeds dreaming beneath the snow your heart dreams of spring.
    Trust the dreams, for in them is hidden the gate to eternity.
    Your fear of death is but the trembling of the shepherd when he stands before the king whose hand is to be laid upon him in honour.
    Is the shepherd not joyful beneath his trembling, that he shall wear the mark of the king?
    Yet is he not more mindful of his trembling?
    For what is it to die but to stand naked in the wind and to melt into the sun?
    And what is it to cease breathing, but to free the breath from its restless tides, that it may rise and expand and seek God unencumbered?
    Only when you drink from the river of silence shall you indeed sing.
    And when you have reached the mountain top, then you shall begin to climb.
    And when the earth shall claim your limbs, then shall you truly dance."
A Prayer for my Daughter,"Once more the storm is howling, and half hid
Under this cradle-hood and coverlid
My child sleeps on. There is no obstacle
But Gregory's wood and one bare hill
Whereby the haystack- and roof-levelling wind,
Bred on the Atlantic, can be stayed;
And for an hour I have walked and prayed
Because of the great gloom that is in my mind.
I have walked and prayed for this young child an hour
And heard the sea-wind scream upon the tower,
And under the arches of the bridge, and scream
In the elms above the flooded stream;
Imagining in excited reverie
That the future years had come,
Dancing to a frenzied drum,
Out of the murderous innocence of the sea.
May she be granted beauty and yet not
Beauty to make a stranger's eye distraught,
Or hers before a looking-glass, for such,
Being made beautiful overmuch,
Consider beauty a sufficient end,
Lose natural kindness and maybe
The heart-revealing intimacy
That chooses right, and never find a friend.
Helen being chosen found life flat and dull
And later had much trouble from a fool,
While that great Queen, that rose out of the spray,
Being fatherless could have her way
Yet chose a bandy-leggèd smith for man.
It's certain that fine women eat
A crazy salad with their meat
Whereby the Horn of Plenty is undone.
In courtesy I'd have her chiefly learned;
Hearts are not had as a gift but hearts are earned
By those that are not entirely beautiful;
Yet many, that have played the fool
For beauty's very self, has charm made wise,
And many a poor man that has roved,
Loved and thought himself beloved,
From a glad kindness cannot take his eyes.
May she become a flourishing hidden tree
That all her thoughts may like the linnet be,
And have no business but dispensing round
Their magnanimities of sound,
Nor but in merriment begin a chase,
Nor but in merriment a quarrel.
O may she live like some green laurel
Rooted in one dear perpetual place.
My mind, because the minds that I have loved,
The sort of beauty that I have approved,
Prosper but little, has dried up of late,
Yet knows that to be choked with hate
May well be of all evil chances chief.
If there's no hatred in a mind
Assault and battery of the wind
Can never tear the linnet from the leaf.
An intellectual hatred is the worst,
So let her think opinions are accursed.
Have I not seen the loveliest woman born
Out of the mouth of Plenty's horn,
Because of her opinionated mind
Barter that horn and every good
By quiet natures understood
For an old bellows full of angry wind?
Considering that, all hatred driven hence,
The soul recovers radical innocence
And learns at last that it is self-delighting,
Self-appeasing, self-affrighting,
And that its own sweet will is Heaven's will;
She can, though every face should scowl
And every windy quarter howl
Or every bellows burst, be happy still.
And may her bridegroom bring her to a house
Where all's accustomed, ceremonious;
For arrogance and hatred are the wares
Peddled in the thoroughfares.
How but in custom and in ceremony
Are innocence and beauty born?
Ceremony's a name for the rich horn,
And custom for the spreading laurel tree."
Shoulders,"A man crosses the street in rain,
stepping gently, looking two times north and south,
because his son is asleep on his shoulder.
No car must splash him.
No car drive too near to his shadow.
This man carries the world’s most sensitive cargo
but he’s not marked.
Nowhere does his jacket say FRAGILE,
HANDLE WITH CARE.
His ear fills up with breathing.
He hears the hum of a boy’s dream
deep inside him.
We’re not going to be able
to live in this world
if we’re not willing to do what he’s doing
with one another.
The road will only be wide.
The rain will never stop falling."
On Marriage,"Then Almitra spoke again and said, And what of Marriage, master?
      And he answered saying:
      You were born together, and together you shall be forevermore.
      You shall be together when the white wings of death scatter your days.
      Ay, you shall be together even in the silent memory of God.
      But let there be spaces in your togetherness,
      And let the winds of the heavens dance between you.
     Love one another, but make not a bond of love:
      Let it rather be a moving sea between the shores of your souls.
      Fill each other’s cup but drink not from one cup.
      Give one another of your bread but eat not from the same loaf.
      Sing and dance together and be joyous, but let each one of your be alone,
      Even as the strings of the lute are alone though they quiver with the same music.
     Give your hearts, but not into each other’s keeping.
      For only the hand of Life can contain your hearts.
      And stand together yet not too near together:
      For the pillars of the temple stand apart,
      And the oak tree and the cypress grow not in each other’s shadow."
The Ballad of Reading Gaol,"I
He did not wear his scarlet coat,
  For blood and wine are red,
And blood and wine were on his hands
  When they found him with the dead,
The poor dead woman whom he loved,
  And murdered in her bed.
He walked amongst the Trial Men
  In a suit of shabby grey;
A cricket cap was on his head,
  And his step seemed light and gay;
But I never saw a man who looked
  So wistfully at the day.
I never saw a man who looked
  With such a wistful eye
Upon that little tent of blue
  Which prisoners call the sky,
And at every drifting cloud that went
  With sails of silver by.
I walked, with other souls in pain,
  Within another ring,
And was wondering if the man had done
  A great or little thing,
When a voice behind me whispered low,
  ""That fellow's got to swing.""
Dear Christ! the very prison walls
  Suddenly seemed to reel,
And the sky above my head became
  Like a casque of scorching steel;
And, though I was a soul in pain,
  My pain I could not feel.
I only knew what hunted thought
  Quickened his step, and why
He looked upon the garish day
  With such a wistful eye;
The man had killed the thing he loved
  And so he had to die.
Yet each man kills the thing he loves
  By each let this be heard,
Some do it with a bitter look,
  Some with a flattering word,
The coward does it with a kiss,
  The brave man with a sword!
Some kill their love when they are young,
  And some when they are old;
Some strangle with the hands of Lust,
  Some with the hands of Gold:
The kindest use a knife, because
  The dead so soon grow cold.
Some love too little, some too long,
  Some sell, and others buy;
Some do the deed with many tears,
  And some without a sigh:
For each man kills the thing he loves,
  Yet each man does not die.
He does not die a death of shame
  On a day of dark disgrace,
Nor have a noose about his neck,
  Nor a cloth upon his face,
Nor drop feet foremost through the floor
  Into an empty place
He does not sit with silent men
  Who watch him night and day;
Who watch him when he tries to weep,
  And when he tries to pray;
Who watch him lest himself should rob
  The prison of its prey.
He does not wake at dawn to see
  Dread figures throng his room,
The shivering Chaplain robed in white,
  The Sheriff stern with gloom,
And the Governor all in shiny black,
  With the yellow face of Doom.
He does not rise in piteous haste
  To put on convict-clothes,
While some coarse-mouthed Doctor gloats, and notes
  Each new and nerve-twitched pose,
Fingering a watch whose little ticks
  Are like horrible hammer-blows.
He does not know that sickening thirst
  That sands one's throat, before
The hangman with his gardener's gloves
  Slips through the padded door,
And binds one with three leathern thongs,
  That the throat may thirst no more.
He does not bend his head to hear
  The Burial Office read,
Nor, while the terror of his soul
  Tells him he is not dead,
Cross his own coffin, as he moves
  Into the hideous shed.
He does not stare upon the air
  Through a little roof of glass;
He does not pray with lips of clay
  For his agony to pass;
Nor feel upon his shuddering cheek
  The kiss of Caiaphas.
II
Six weeks our guardsman walked the yard,
  In a suit of shabby grey:
His cricket cap was on his head,
  And his step seemed light and gay,
But I never saw a man who looked
  So wistfully at the day.
I never saw a man who looked
  With such a wistful eye
Upon that little tent of blue
  Which prisoners call the sky,
And at every wandering cloud that trailed
  Its raveled fleeces by.
He did not wring his hands, as do
  Those witless men who dare
To try to rear the changeling Hope
  In the cave of black Despair:
He only looked upon the sun,
  And drank the morning air.
He did not wring his hands nor weep,
  Nor did he peek or pine,
But he drank the air as though it held
  Some healthful anodyne;
With open mouth he drank the sun
  As though it had been wine!
And I and all the souls in pain,
  Who tramped the other ring,
Forgot if we ourselves had done
  A great or little thing,
And watched with gaze of dull amaze
  The man who had to swing.
And strange it was to see him pass
  With a step so light and gay,
And strange it was to see him look
  So wistfully at the day,
And strange it was to think that he
  Had such a debt to pay.
For oak and elm have pleasant leaves
  That in the spring-time shoot:
But grim to see is the gallows-tree,
  With its adder-bitten root,
And, green or dry, a man must die
  Before it bears its fruit!
The loftiest place is that seat of grace
  For which all worldlings try:
But who would stand in hempen band
  Upon a scaffold high,
And through a murderer's collar take
  His last look at the sky?
It is sweet to dance to violins
  When Love and Life are fair:
To dance to flutes, to dance to lutes
  Is delicate and rare:
But it is not sweet with nimble feet
  To dance upon the air!
So with curious eyes and sick surmise
  We watched him day by day,
And wondered if each one of us
  Would end the self-same way,
For none can tell to what red Hell
  His sightless soul may stray.
At last the dead man walked no more
  Amongst the Trial Men,
And I knew that he was standing up
  In the black dock's dreadful pen,
And that never would I see his face
  In God's sweet world again.
Like two doomed ships that pass in storm
  We had crossed each other's way:
But we made no sign, we said no word,
  We had no word to say;
For we did not meet in the holy night,
  But in the shameful day.
A prison wall was round us both,
  Two outcast men were we:
The world had thrust us from its heart,
  And God from out His care:
And the iron gin that waits for Sin
  Had caught us in its snare.
III
In Debtors' Yard the stones are hard,
  And the dripping wall is high,
So it was there he took the air
  Beneath the leaden sky,
And by each side a Warder walked,
  For fear the man might die.
Or else he sat with those who watched
  His anguish night and day;
Who watched him when he rose to weep,
  And when he crouched to pray;
Who watched him lest himself should rob
  Their scaffold of its prey.
The Governor was strong upon
  The Regulations Act:
The Doctor said that Death was but
  A scientific fact:
And twice a day the Chaplain called
  And left a little tract.
And twice a day he smoked his pipe,
  And drank his quart of beer:
His soul was resolute, and held
  No hiding-place for fear;
He often said that he was glad
  The hangman's hands were near.
But why he said so strange a thing
  No Warder dared to ask:
For he to whom a watcher's doom
  Is given as his task,
Must set a lock upon his lips,
  And make his face a mask.
Or else he might be moved, and try
  To comfort or console:
And what should Human Pity do
  Pent up in Murderers' Hole?
What word of grace in such a place
  Could help a brother's soul?
With slouch and swing around the ring
  We trod the Fool's Parade!
We did not care: we knew we were
  The Devil's Own Brigade:
And shaven head and feet of lead
  Make a merry masquerade.
We tore the tarry rope to shreds
  With blunt and bleeding nails;
We rubbed the doors, and scrubbed the floors,
  And cleaned the shining rails:
And, rank by rank, we soaped the plank,
  And clattered with the pails.
We sewed the sacks, we broke the stones,
  We turned the dusty drill:
We banged the tins, and bawled the hymns,
  And sweated on the mill:
But in the heart of every man
  Terror was lying still.
So still it lay that every day
  Crawled like a weed-clogged wave:
And we forgot the bitter lot
  That waits for fool and knave
, Till once, as we tramped in from work,
  We passed an open grave.
With yawning mouth the yellow hole
  Gaped for a living thing;
The very mud cried out for blood
  To the thirsty asphalte ring:
And we knew that ere one dawn grew fair
  Some prisoner had to swing.
Right in we went, with soul intent
  On Death and Dread and Doom:
The hangman, with his little bag,
  Went shuffling through the gloom
And each man trembled as he crept
  Into his numbered tomb.
That night the empty corridors
  Were full of forms of Fear,
And up and down the iron town
  Stole feet we could not hear,
And through the bars that hide the stars
  White faces seemed to peer.
He lay as one who lies and dreams
  In a pleasant meadow-land,
The watcher watched him as he slept,
  And could not understand
How one could sleep so sweet a sleep
  With a hangman close at hand?
But there is no sleep when men must weep
  Who never yet have wept:
So we—the fool, the fraud, the knave—
  That endless vigil kept,
And through each brain on hands of pain
  Another's terror crept.
Alas! it is a fearful thing
  To feel another's guilt!
For, right within, the sword of Sin
  Pierced to its poisoned hilt,
And as molten lead were the tears we shed
  For the blood we had not spilt.
The Warders with their shoes of felt
  Crept by each padlocked door,
And peeped and saw, with eyes of awe,
  Grey figures on the floor,
And wondered why men knelt to pray
  Who never prayed before.
All through the night we knelt and prayed,
  Mad mourners of a corpse!
The troubled plumes of midnight were
  The plumes upon a hearse:
And bitter wine upon a sponge
  Was the savior of Remorse.
The cock crew, the red cock crew,
  But never came the day:
And crooked shape of Terror crouched,
  In the corners where we lay:
And each evil sprite that walks by night
  Before us seemed to play.
They glided past, they glided fast,
  Like travelers through a mist:
They mocked the moon in a rigadoon
  Of delicate turn and twist,
And with formal pace and loathsome grace
  The phantoms kept their tryst.
With mop and mow, we saw them go,
  Slim shadows hand in hand:
About, about, in ghostly rout
  They trod a saraband:
And the damned grotesques made arabesques,
  Like the wind upon the sand!
With the pirouettes of marionettes,
  They tripped on pointed tread:
But with flutes of Fear they filled the ear,
  As their grisly masque they led,
And loud they sang, and loud they sang,
  For they sang to wake the dead.
""Oho!"" they cried, ""The world is wide,
  But fettered limbs go lame!
And once, or twice, to throw the dice
  Is a gentlemanly game,
But he does not win who plays with Sin
  In the secret House of Shame.""
No things of air these antics were
  That frolicked with such glee:
To men whose lives were held in gyves,
  And whose feet might not go free,
Ah! wounds of Christ! they were living things,
  Most terrible to see.
Around, around, they waltzed and wound;
  Some wheeled in smirking pairs:
With the mincing step of demirep
  Some sidled up the stairs:
And with subtle sneer, and fawning leer,
  Each helped us at our prayers.
The morning wind began to moan,
  But still the night went on:
Through its giant loom the web of gloom
  Crept till each thread was spun:
And, as we prayed, we grew afraid
  Of the Justice of the Sun.
The moaning wind went wandering round
  The weeping prison-wall:
Till like a wheel of turning-steel
  We felt the minutes crawl:
O moaning wind! what had we done
  To have such a seneschal?
At last I saw the shadowed bars
  Like a lattice wrought in lead,
Move right across the whitewashed wall
  That faced my three-plank bed,
And I knew that somewhere in the world
  God's dreadful dawn was red.
At six o'clock we cleaned our cells,
  At seven all was still,
But the sough and swing of a mighty wing
  The prison seemed to fill,
For the Lord of Death with icy breath
  Had entered in to kill.
He did not pass in purple pomp,
  Nor ride a moon-white steed.
Three yards of cord and a sliding board
  Are all the gallows' need:
So with rope of shame the Herald came
  To do the secret deed.
We were as men who through a fen
  Of filthy darkness grope:
We did not dare to breathe a prayer,
  Or give our anguish scope:
Something was dead in each of us,
  And what was dead was Hope.
For Man's grim Justice goes its way,
  And will not swerve aside:
It slays the weak, it slays the strong,
  It has a deadly stride:
With iron heel it slays the strong,
  The monstrous parricide!
We waited for the stroke of eight:
  Each tongue was thick with thirst:
For the stroke of eight is the stroke of Fate
  That makes a man accursed,
And Fate will use a running noose
  For the best man and the worst.
We had no other thing to do,
  Save to wait for the sign to com
e: So, like things of stone in a valley lone,
  Quiet we sat and dumb:
But each man's heart beat thick and quick
  Like a madman on a drum!
With sudden shock the prison-clock
  Smote on the shivering air,
And from all the gaol rose up a wail
  Of impotent despair,
Like the sound that frightened marshes hear
  From a leper in his lair.
And as one sees most fearful things
  In the crystal of a dream,
We saw the greasy hempen rope
  Hooked to the blackened beam,
And heard the prayer the hangman's snare
  Strangled into a scream.
And all the woe that moved him so
  That he gave that bitter cry,
And the wild regrets, and the bloody sweats,
  None knew so well as I:
For he who lives more lives than one
  More deaths than one must die.
IV
There is no chapel on the day
  On which they hang a man:
The Chaplain's heart is far too sick,
  Or his face is far too wan,
Or there is that written in his eyes
  Which none should look upon.
So they kept us close till nigh on noon,
  And then they rang the bell,
And the Warders with their jingling keys
  Opened each listening cell,
And down the iron stair we tramped,
  Each from his separate Hell.
Out into God's sweet air we went,
  But not in wonted way,
For this man's face was white with fear,
  And that man's face was grey,
And I never saw sad men who looked
  So wistfully at the day.
I never saw sad men who looked
  With such a wistful eye
Upon that little tent of blue
  We prisoners called the sky,
And at every careless cloud that passed
  In happy freedom by.
But there were those amongst us all
  Who walked with downcast head,
And knew that, had each got his due,
  They should have died instead:
He had but killed a thing that lived
  Whilst they had killed the dead.
For he who sins a second time
  Wakes a dead soul to pain,
And draws it from its spotted shroud,
  And makes it bleed again,
And makes it bleed great gouts of blood
  And makes it bleed in vain!
Like ape or clown, in monstrous garb
  With crooked arrows starred,
Silently we went round and round
  The slippery asphalte yard;
Silently we went round and round,
  And no man spoke a word.
Silently we went round and round,
  And through each hollow mind
The memory of dreadful things
  Rushed like a dreadful wind,
And Horror stalked before each man,
  And terror crept behind.
The Warders strutted up and down,
  And kept their herd of brutes,
Their uniforms were spick and span,
  And they wore their Sunday suits,
But we knew the work they had been at
  By the quicklime on their boots.
For where a grave had opened wide,
  There was no grave at all:
Only a stretch of mud and sand
  By the hideous prison-wall,
And a little heap of burning lime,
  That the man should have his pall.
For he has a pall, this wretched man,
  Such as few men can claim:
Deep down below a prison-yard,
  Naked for greater shame,
He lies, with fetters on each foot,
  Wrapt in a sheet of flame!
And all the while the burning lime
  Eats flesh and bone away,
It eats the brittle bone by night,
  And the soft flesh by the day,
It eats the flesh and bones by turns,
  But it eats the heart alway.
For three long years they will not sow
  Or root or seedling there:
For three long years the unblessed spot
  Will sterile be and bare,
And look upon the wondering sky
  With unreproachful stare.
They think a murderer's heart would taint
  Each simple seed they sow.
It is not true! God's kindly earth
  Is kindlier than men know,
And the red rose would but blow more red,
  The white rose whiter blow.
Out of his mouth a red, red rose!
  Out of his heart a white!
For who can say by what strange way,
  Christ brings his will to light,
Since the barren staff the pilgrim bore
  Bloomed in the great Pope's sight?
But neither milk-white rose nor red
  May bloom in prison air;
The shard, the pebble, and the flint,
  Are what they give us there:
For flowers have been known to heal
  A common man's despair.
So never will wine-red rose or white,
  Petal by petal, fall
On that stretch of mud and sand that lies
  By the hideous prison-wall,
To tell the men who tramp the yard
<7nbsp; That God's Son died for all.
Yet though the hideous prison-wall
  Still hems him round and round,
And a spirit man not walk by night
  That is with fetters bound,
And a spirit may not weep that lies
  In such unholy ground,
He is at peace—this wretched man—
  At peace, or will be soon:
There is no thing to make him mad,
  Nor does Terror walk at noon,
For the lampless Earth in which he lies
  Has neither Sun nor Moon.
They hanged him as a beast is hanged:
  They did not even toll
A reguiem that might have brought
  Rest to his startled soul,
But hurriedly they took him out,
  And hid him in a hole.
They stripped him of his canvas clothes,
  And gave him to the flies;
They mocked the swollen purple throat
  And the stark and staring eyes:
And with laughter loud they heaped the shroud
  In which their convict lies.
The Chaplain would not kneel to pray
  By his dishonored grave:
Nor mark it with that blessed Cross
  That Christ for sinners gave,
Because the man was one of those
  Whom Christ came down to save.
Yet all is well; he has but passed
  To Life's appointed bourne:
And alien tears will fill for him
  Pity's long-broken urn,
For his mourner will be outcast men,
  And outcasts always mourn.
V
I know not whether Laws be right,
  Or whether Laws be wrong;
All that we know who lie in gaol
  Is that the wall is strong;
And that each day is like a year,
  A year whose days are long.
But this I know, that every Law
  That men have made for Man,
Since first Man took his brother's life,
  And the sad world began,
But straws the wheat and saves the chaff
  With a most evil fan.
This too I know—and wise it were
  If each could know the same—
That every prison that men build
  Is built with bricks of shame,
And bound with bars lest Christ should see
  How men their brothers maim.
With bars they blur the gracious moon,
  And blind the goodly sun:
And they do well to hide their Hell,
  For in it things are done
That Son of God nor son of Man
  Ever should look upon!
The vilest deeds like poison weeds
  Bloom well in prison-air:
It is only what is good in Man
  That wastes and withers there:
Pale Anguish keeps the heavy gate,
  And the Warder is Despair
For they starve the little frightened child
  Till it weeps both night and day:
And they scourge the weak, and flog the fool,
  And gibe the old and grey,
And some grow mad, and all grow bad,
  And none a word may say.
Each narrow cell in which we dwell
  Is foul and dark latrine,
And the fetid breath of living Death
  Chokes up each grated screen,
And all, but Lust, is turned to dust
  In Humanity's machine.
The brackish water that we drink
  Creeps with a loathsome slime,
And the bitter bread they weigh in scales
  Is full of chalk and lime,
And Sleep will not lie down, but walks
  Wild-eyed and cries to Time.
But though lean Hunger and green Thirst
  Like asp with adder fight,
We have little care of prison fare,
  For what chills and kills outright
Is that every stone one lifts by day
  Becomes one's heart by night.
With midnight always in one's heart,
  And twilight in one's cell,
We turn the crank, or tear the rope,
  Each in his separate Hell,
And the silence is more awful far
  Than the sound of a brazen bell.
And never a human voice comes near
  To speak a gentle word:
And the eye that watches through the door
  Is pitiless and hard:
And by all forgot, we rot and rot,
  With soul and body marred.
And thus we rust Life's iron chain
  Degraded and alone:
And some men curse, and some men weep,
  And some men make no moan:
But God's eternal Laws are kind
  And break the heart of stone.
And every human heart that breaks,
  In prison-cell or yard,
Is as that broken box that gave
  Its treasure to the Lord,
And filled the unclean leper's house
  With the scent of costliest nard.
Ah! happy day they whose hearts can break
  And peace of pardon win!
How else may man make straight his plan
  And cleanse his soul from Sin?
How else but through a broken heart
  May Lord Christ enter in?
And he of the swollen purple throat.
  And the stark and staring eyes,
Waits for the holy hands that took
  The Thief to Paradise;
And a broken and a contrite heart
  The Lord will not despise.
The man in red who reads the Law
  Gave him three weeks of life,
Three little weeks in which to heal
  His soul of his soul's strife,
And cleanse from every blot of blood
  The hand that held the knife.
And with tears of blood he cleansed the hand,
  The hand that held the steel:
For only blood can wipe out blood,
  And only tears can heal:
And the crimson stain that was of Cain
  Became Christ's snow-white seal.
VI
In Reading gaol by Reading town
  There is a pit of shame,
And in it lies a wretched man
  Eaten by teeth of flame,
In burning winding-sheet he lies,
  And his grave has got no name.
And there, till Christ call forth the dead,
  In silence let him lie:
No need to waste the foolish tear,
  Or heave the windy sigh:
The man had killed the thing he loved,
  And so he had to die.
And all men kill the thing they love,
  By all let this be heard,
Some do it with a bitter look,
  Some with a flattering word,
The coward does it with a kiss,
  The brave man with a sword!"

Ecclesiastes 3:1-8,"To every thing there is a season,
and a time to every purpose under the heaven:
A time to be born, a time to die;
a time to plant, and a time to pluck up that which is planted;
A time to kill, and a time to heal;
a time to break down, and a time to build up;
A time to weep, and a time to laugh;

A time to cast away stones, and a time to gather stones together;

I Must Become a Menace to My Enemies,"Dedicated to the Poet Agostinho Neto,
President of The People’s Republic of Angola: 1976
1
I will no longer lightly walk behind
a one of you who fear me:
                                     Be afraid.
I plan to give you reasons for your jumpy fits
and facial tics
I will not walk politely on the pavements anymore
and this is dedicated in particular
to those who hear my footsteps
or the insubstantial rattling of my grocery
cart
then turn around
see me
and hurry on
away from this impressive terror I must be:
I plan to blossom bloody on an afternoon
surrounded by my comrades singing
terrible revenge in merciless
accelerating
rhythms
But
I have watched a blind man studying his face.
I have set the table in the evening and sat down
to eat the news.
Regularly
I have gone to sleep.
There is no one to forgive me.
The dead do not give a damn.
I live like a lover
who drops her dime into the phone
just as the subway shakes into the station
wasting her message
canceling the question of her call:
fulminating or forgetful but late
and always after the fact that could save or 
condemn me
I must become the action of my fate.
2
How many of my brothers and my sisters
will they kill
before I teach myself
retaliation?
Shall we pick a number? 
South Africa for instance:
do we agree that more than ten thousand
in less than a year but that less than
five thousand slaughtered in more than six
months will
WHAT IS THE MATTER WITH ME?
I must become a menace to my enemies.
3
And if I 
if I ever let you slide
who should be extirpated from my universe
who should be cauterized from earth
completely
(lawandorder jerkoffs of the first the
                   terrorist degree)
then let my body fail my soul
in its bedeviled lecheries
And if I 
if I ever let love go
because the hatred and the whisperings
become a phantom dictate I o-
bey in lieu of impulse and realities
(the blossoming flamingos of my
                   wild mimosa trees)
then let love freeze me
out.
I must become
I must become a menace to my enemies."

She Walks in Beauty,"I.
She walks in beauty, like the night
Of cloudless climes and starry skies;
And all that’s best of dark and bright
Meet in her aspect and her eyes:
Thus mellowed to that tender light
Which heaven to gaudy day denies.
II.
One shade the more, one ray the less,
Had half impaired the nameless grace
Which waves in every raven tress,
Or softly lightens o’er her face;
Where thoughts serenely sweet express
How pure, how dear their dwelling place.
III.
And on that cheek, and o’er that brow,
So soft, so calm, yet eloquent,
The smiles that win, the tints that glow,
But tell of days in goodness spent,
A mind at peace with all below,
A heart whose love is innocent!"
The Heart of the Tree,"What does he plant who plants a tree?
   He plants a friend of sun and sky;
He plants the flag of breezes free;
   The shaft of beauty, towering high;
   He plants a home to heaven anigh;
      For song and mother-croon of bird
      In hushed and happy twilight heard—
The treble of heaven's harmony—
These things he plants who plants a tree.
What does he plant who plants a tree?
   He plants cool shade and tender rain,
And seed and bud of days to be,
   And years that fade and flush again;
      He plants the glory of the plain;
      He plants the forest's heritage;
      The harvest of a coming age;
The joy that unborn eyes shall see—
These things he plants who plants a tree.
What does he plant who plants a tree?
   He plants, in sap and leaf and wood,
In love of home and loyalty
   And far-cast thought of civic good—
   His blessings on the neighborhood,
      Who in the hollow of His hand
      Holds all the growth of all our land—
A nation's growth from sea to sea
Stirs in his heart who plants a tree."
The Star-Spangled Banner,"O say, can you see, by the dawn's early light,
What so proudly we hailed at the twilight's last gleaming?
Whose broad stripes and bright stars through the perilous fight,
O'er the ramparts we watched were so gallantly streaming;
And the rocket's red glare, the bombs bursting in air,
Gave proof through the night that our flag was still there;
O say, does that star-spangled banner yet wave
O'er the land of the free, and the home of the brave?
On the shore dimly seen through the mists of the deep,
Where the foe's haughty host in dread silence reposes,
What is that which the breeze, o'er the towering steep,
As it fitfully blows, now conceals, now discloses?
Now it catches the gleam of the morning's first beam,
In full glory reflected now shines on the stream;
'Tis the star-spangled banner; O long may it wave
O'er the land of the free, and the home of the brave!
And where is that band who so vauntingly swore
That the havoc of war and the battle's confusion
A home and a country should leave us no more?
Their blood has washed out their foul footsteps' pollution.
No refuge could save the hireling and slave,
From the terror of flight and the gloom of the grave;
And the star-spangled banner in triumph doth wave
O'er the land of the free, and the home of the brave!
O! thus be it ever, when freemen shall stand
Between their loved homes and the war's desolation!
Blest with victory and peace, may the heav'n-rescued land,
Praise the power that hath made and preserved us a nation.
Then conquer we must, for our cause it is just.
And this be our motto— ""In God is our trust; ""
And the star-spangled banner in triumph shall wave
O'er the land of the free, and the home of the brave."
Poetry,"I too, dislike it: there are things that are important beyond all this fiddle.
   Reading it, however, with a perfect contempt for it, one discovers that there is in
   it after all, a place for the genuine.
      Hands that can grasp, eyes
      that can dilate, hair that can rise
         if it must, these things are important not because a
high-sounding interpretation can be put upon them but because they are
   useful; when they become so derivative as to become unintelligible, the
   same thing may be said for all of us—that we
      do not admire what
      we cannot understand. The bat,
         holding on upside down or in quest of something to
eat, elephants pushing, a wild horse taking a roll, a tireless wolf under
   a tree, the immovable critic twinkling his skin like a horse that feels a flea, the base—
   ball fan, the statistician—case after case
      could be cited did
      one wish it; nor is it valid
         to discriminate against “business documents and
school-books”; all these phenomena are important. One must make a distinction
   however: when dragged into prominence by half poets, the result is not poetry,
   nor till the autocrats among us can be
     “literalists of
      the imagination”—above
         insolence and triviality and can present
for inspection, imaginary gardens with real toads in them, shall we have
   it. In the meantime, if you demand on the one hand, in defiance of their opinion—
   the raw material of poetry in
      all its rawness, and
      that which is on the other hand,
         genuine, then you are interested in poetry."
American History,"Those four black girls blown up
in that Alabama church
remind me of five hundred
middle passage blacks,
in a net, under water
in Charleston harbor
so redcoats wouldn't find them.
Can't find what you can't see
can you?"
The Shield of Achilles,"    She looked over his shoulder
       For vines and olive trees,
    Marble well-governed cities
       And ships upon untamed seas,
    But there on the shining metal
       His hands had put instead
    An artificial wilderness
       And a sky like lead.
A plain without a feature, bare and brown,
   No blade of grass, no sign of neighborhood,
Nothing to eat and nowhere to sit down,
   Yet, congregated on its blankness, stood
   An unintelligible multitude,
A million eyes, a million boots in line,
Without expression, waiting for a sign.
Out of the air a voice without a face
   Proved by statistics that some cause was just
In tones as dry and level as the place:
   No one was cheered and nothing was discussed;
   Column by column in a cloud of dust
They marched away enduring a belief
Whose logic brought them, somewhere else, to grief.
    She looked over his shoulder
       For ritual pieties,
    White flower-garlanded heifers,
       Libation and sacrifice,
    But there on the shining metal
       Where the altar should have been,
    She saw by his flickering forge-light
       Quite another scene.
Barbed wire enclosed an arbitrary spot
   Where bored officials lounged (one cracked a joke)
And sentries sweated for the day was hot:
   A crowd of ordinary decent folk
   Watched from without and neither moved nor spoke
As three pale figures were led forth and bound
To three posts driven upright in the ground.
The mass and majesty of this world, all
   That carries weight and always weighs the same
Lay in the hands of others; they were small
   And could not hope for help and no help came:
   What their foes liked to do was done, their shame
Was all the worst could wish; they lost their pride
And died as men before their bodies died.
    She looked over his shoulder
       For athletes at their games,
    Men and women in a dance
       Moving their sweet limbs
    Quick, quick, to music,
       But there on the shining shield
    His hands had set no dancing-floor
       But a weed-choked field.
A ragged urchin, aimless and alone,
   Loitered about that vacancy; a bird
Flew up to safety from his well-aimed stone:
   That girls are raped, that two boys knife a third,
   Were axioms to him, who'd never heard
Of any world where promises were kept,
Or one could weep because another wept.
    The thin-lipped armorer,
       Hephaestos, hobbled away,
    Thetis of the shining breasts
       Cried out in dismay
    At what the god had wrought
       To please her son, the strong
    Iron-hearted man-slaying Achilles
       Who would not live long."
Ode to My Socks,"Maru Mori brought me
a pair
of socks
which she knitted herself
with her sheepherder’s hands,
two socks as soft
as rabbits.
I slipped my feet
into them
as though into
two
cases
knitted
with threads of
twilight
and goatskin.
Violent socks,
my feet were
two fish made
of wool,
two long sharks
sea-blue, shot
through
by one golden thread,
two immense blackbirds,
two cannons:
my feet
were honored
in this way
by
these
heavenly
socks.
They were
so handsome
for the first time
my feet seemed to me
unacceptable
like two decrepit
firemen, firemen
unworthy
of that woven
fire,
of those glowing
socks.
Nevertheless
I resisted
the sharp temptation
to save them somewhere
as schoolboys
keep
fireflies,
as learned men
collect
sacred texts,
I resisted
the mad impulse
to put them
into a golden
cage
and each day give them
birdseed
and pieces of pink melon.
Like explorers
in the jungle who hand
over the very rare
green deer
to the spit
and eat it
with remorse,
I stretched out
my feet
and pulled on
the magnificent
socks
and then my shoes.
The moral
of my ode is this:
beauty is twice
beauty
and what is good is doubly
good
when it is a matter of two socks
made of wool
in winter."
Gate A-4,"Wandering around the Albuquerque Airport Terminal, after learning
my flight had been delayed four hours, I heard an announcement:
""If anyone in the vicinity of Gate A-4 understands any Arabic, please
come to the gate immediately.""
Well—one pauses these days. Gate A-4 was my own gate. I went there.
An older woman in full traditional Palestinian embroidered dress, just
like my grandma wore, was crumpled to the floor, wailing. ""Help,""
said the flight agent. ""Talk to her. What is her problem? We
told her the flight was going to be late and she did this.""
I stooped to put my arm around the woman and spoke haltingly.
""Shu-dow-a, Shu-bid-uck Habibti? Stani schway, Min fadlick, Shu-bit-
se-wee?"" The minute she heard any words she knew, however poorly
used, she stopped crying. She thought the flight had been cancelled
entirely. She needed to be in El Paso for major medical treatment the
next day. I said, ""No, we're fine, you'll get there, just later, who is
picking you up? Let's call him.""
We called her son, I spoke with him in English. I told him I would
stay with his mother till we got on the plane and ride next to
her. She talked to him. Then we called her other sons just
for the fun of it. Then we called my dad and he and she spoke for a while
in Arabic and found out of course they had ten shared friends. Then I
thought just for the heck of it why not call some Palestinian poets I know
and let them chat with her? This all took up two hours.
She was laughing a lot by then. Telling of her life, patting my knee,
answering questions. She had pulled a sack of homemade mamool
cookies—little powdered sugar crumbly mounds stuffed with dates and
nuts—from her bag—and was offering them to all the women at the gate.
To my amazement, not a single woman declined one. It was like a
sacrament. The traveler from Argentina, the mom from California, the
lovely woman from Laredo—we were all covered with the same powdered
sugar. And smiling. There is no better cookie.
And then the airline broke out free apple juice from huge coolers and two
little girls from our flight ran around serving it and they
were covered with powdered sugar, too. And I noticed my new best friend—
by now we were holding hands—had a potted plant poking out of her bag,
some medicinal thing, with green furry leaves. Such an old country tradi-
tion. Always carry a plant. Always stay rooted to somewhere.
And I looked around that gate of late and weary ones and I thought, This
is the world I want to live in. The shared world. Not a single person in that
gate—once the crying of confusion stopped—seemed apprehensive about
any other person. They took the cookies. I wanted to hug all those other women, too.
This can still happen anywhere. Not everything is lost."

The Village Blacksmith,"Under a spreading chestnut-tree
     ⁠The village smithy stands;
The smith, a mighty man is he,
     With large and sinewy hands,
And the muscles of his brawny arms
     Are strong as iron bands.
His hair is crisp, and black, and long;
     His face is like the tan;
His brow is wet with honest sweat,
     He earns whate'er he can,
And looks the whole world in the face,
     For he owes not any man.
Week in, week out, from morn till night,
     You can hear his bellows blow;
You can hear him swing his heavy sledge,
     With measured beat and slow,
Like a sexton ringing the village bell,
     When the evening sun is low.
And children coming home from school
     Look in at the open door;
They love to see the flaming forge,
     And hear the bellows roar,
And catch the burning sparks that fly
     Like chaff from a threshing-floor.
He goes on Sunday to the church,
     And sits among his boys;
He hears the parson pray and preach,
     He hears his daughter's voice
Singing in the village choir,
     And it makes his heart rejoice.
It sounds to him like her mother's voice
     Singing in Paradise!
He needs must think of her once more,
     How in the grave she lies;
And with his hard, rough hand he wipes
     A tear out of his eyes.
Toiling,—rejoicing,—sorrowing,
     Onward through life he goes;
Each morning sees some task begin,
     Each evening sees it close;
Something attempted, something done,
     Has earned a night's repose.
Thanks, thanks to thee, my worthy friend,
     For the lesson thou hast taught!
Thus at the flaming forge of life
     Our fortunes must be wrought;
Thus on its sounding anvil shaped
     Each burning deed and thought."
[I wandered lonely as a Cloud],"I wandered lonely as a Cloud
   That floats on high o’er Vales and Hills,
When all at once I saw a crowd,
   A host of golden Daffodils;
Beside the Lake, beneath the trees,
Fluttering and dancing in the breeze.
Continuous as the stars that shine
   And twinkle on the Milky Way,
They stretched in never-ending line
   Along the margin of a bay:
Ten thousand saw I at a glance,
Tossing their heads in sprightly dance.
The waves beside them danced, but they
   Out-did the sparkling waves in glee:—
A Poet could not but be gay
   In such a jocund company:
I gazed—and gazed—but little thought
What wealth the shew to me had brought:
For oft when on my couch I lie
   In vacant or in pensive mood,
They flash upon that inward eye
   Which is the bliss of solitude,
And then my heart with pleasure fills,
And dances with the Daffodils."
The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock,"     S’io credesse che mia risposta fosse
     A persona che mai tornasse al mondo,
     Questa fiamma staria senza piu scosse.
     Ma perciocche giammai di questo fondo
     Non torno vivo alcun, s’i’odo il vero,
     Senza tema d'infamia ti rispondo.
Let us go then, you and I,
When the evening is spread out against the sky
Like a patient etherized upon a table;
Let us go, through certain half-deserted streets,
The muttering retreats
Of restless nights in one-night cheap hotels
And sawdust restaurants with oyster-shells:
Streets that follow like a tedious argument
Of insidious intent
To lead you to an overwhelming question…
Oh, do not ask, “What is it?”
Let us go and make our visit.
In the room the women come and go
Talking of Michelangelo.
The yellow fog that rubs its back upon the window-panes,
The yellow smoke that rubs its muzzle on the window-panes
Licked its tongue into the corners of the evening,
Lingered upon the pools that stand in drains,
Let fall upon its back the soot that falls from chimneys,
Slipped by the terrace, made a sudden leap,
And seeing that it was a soft October night,
Curled once about the house, and fell asleep.
And indeed there will be time
For the yellow smoke that slides along the street,
Rubbing its back upon the window-panes;
There will be time, there will be time
To prepare a face to meet the faces that you meet;
There will be time to murder and create,
And time for all the works and days of hands
That lift and drop a question on your plate;
Time for you and time for me,
And time yet for a hundred indecisions,
And for a hundred visions and revisions,
Before the taking of a toast and tea.
In the room the women come and go
Talking of Michelangelo.
And indeed there will be time
To wonder, “Do I dare?” and, “Do I dare?”
Time to turn back and descend the stair,
With a bald spot in the middle of my hair—
[They will say: “How his hair is growing thin!”]
My morning coat, my collar mounting firmly to the chin,
My necktie rich and modest, but asserted by a simple pin—
[They will say: “But how his arms and legs are thin!”]
Do I dare
Disturb the universe?
In a minute there is time
For decisions and revisions which a minute will reverse.
For I have known them all already, known them all—
Have known the evenings, mornings, afternoons,
I have measured out my life with coffee spoons;
I know the voices dying with a dying fall
Beneath the music from a farther room.
     So how should I presume?
And I have known the eyes already, known them all—
The eyes that fix you in a formulated phrase,
And when I am formulated, sprawling on a pin,
When I am pinned and wriggling on the wall,
Then how should I begin
To spit out all the butt-ends of my days and ways?
     And how should I presume?
And I have known the arms already, known them all—
Arms that are braceleted and white and bare
[But in the lamplight, downed with light brown hair!]
Is it perfume from a dress
That makes me so digress?
Arms that lie along a table, or wrap about a shawl.
     And should I then presume?
     And how should I begin?
          . . . . .
Shall I say, I have gone at dusk through narrow streets
And watched the smoke that rises from the pipes
Of lonely men in shirt-sleeves, leaning out of windows? …
I should have been a pair of ragged claws
Scuttling across the floors of silent seas.
          . . . . .
And the afternoon, the evening, sleeps so peacefully!
Smoothed by long fingers,
Asleep… tired… or it malingers,
Stretched on the floor, here beside you and me.
Should I, after tea and cakes and ices,
Have the strength to force the moment to its crisis?
But though I have wept and fasted, wept and prayed,
Though I have seen my head [grown slightly bald] brought in upon a platter,
I am no prophet—and here’s no great matter;
I have seen the moment of my greatness flicker,
And I have seen the eternal Footman hold my coat, and snicker,
And in short, I was afraid.
And would it have been worth it, after all,
After the cups, the marmalade, the tea,
Among the porcelain, among some talk of you and me,
Would it have been worth while,
To have bitten off the matter with a smile,
To have squeezed the universe into a ball
To roll it toward some overwhelming question,
To say: “I am Lazarus, come from the dead,
Come back to tell you all, I shall tell you all”—
If one, settling a pillow by her head,
     Should say: “That is not what I meant at all.
     That is not it, at all.”
And would it have been worth it, after all,
Would it have been worth while,
After the sunsets and the dooryards and the sprinkled streets,
After the novels, after the teacups, after the skirts that trail along the floor—
And this, and so much more?—
It is impossible to say just what I mean!
But as if a magic lantern threw the nerves in patterns on a screen:
Would it have been worth while
If one, settling a pillow or throwing off a shawl,
And turning toward the window, should say:
     “That is not it at all,
     That is not what I meant, at all.”
          . . . . .
No! I am not Prince Hamlet, nor was meant to be;
Am an attendant lord, one that will do
To swell a progress, start a scene or two,
Advise the prince; no doubt, an easy tool,
Deferential, glad to be of use,
Politic, cautious, and meticulous;
Full of high sentence, but a bit obtuse;
At times, indeed, almost ridiculous—
Almost, at times, the Fool.
I grow old… I grow old…
I shall wear the bottoms of my trousers rolled.
Shall I part my hair behind? Do I dare to eat a peach?
I shall wear white flannel trousers, and walk upon the beach.
I have heard the mermaids singing, each to each.
I do not think that they will sing to me.
I have seen them riding seaward on the waves
Combing the white hair of the waves blown back
When the wind blows the water white and black.
We have lingered in the chambers of the sea
By sea-girls wreathed with seaweed red and brown
Till human voices wake us, and we drown."
I taste a liquor never brewed (214),"I taste a liquor never brewed – 
From Tankards scooped in Pearl – 
Not all the Frankfort Berries
Yield such an Alcohol!
Inebriate of air – am I – 
And Debauchee of Dew – 
Reeling – thro' endless summer days – 
From inns of molten Blue – 
When ""Landlords"" turn the drunken Bee
Out of the Foxglove's door – 
When Butterflies – renounce their ""drams"" – 
I shall but drink the more!
Till Seraphs swing their snowy Hats – 
And Saints – to windows run – 
To see the little Tippler
Leaning against the – Sun!"
Dulce et Decorum Est,"Bent double, like old beggars under sacks,
Knock-kneed, coughing like hags, we cursed through sludge,
Till on the haunting flares we turned our backs
And towards our distant rest began to trudge.
Men marched asleep. Many had lost their boots
But limped on, blood-shod. All went lame; all blind;
Drunk with fatigue; deaf even to the hoots
Of tired, outstripped Five-Nines that dropped behind.
Gas! Gas! Quick, boys!—An ecstasy of fumbling,
Fitting the clumsy helmets just in time;
But someone still was yelling out and stumbling
And flound'ring like a man in fire or lime...
Dim, through the misty panes and thick green light,
As under a green sea, I saw him drowning.
In all my dreams, before my helpless sight,
He plunges at me, guttering, choking, drowning.
If in some smothering dreams you too could pace
Behind the wagon that we flung him in,
And watch the white eyes writhing in his face,
His hanging face, like a devil's sick of sin;
If you could hear, at every jolt, the blood
Come gargling from the froth-corrupted lungs,
Obscene as cancer, bitter as the cud
Of vile, incurable sores on innocent tongues,—
My friend, you would not tell with such high zest
To children ardent for some desperate glory,
The old Lie: Dulce et decorum est
Pro patria mori."
For the Fallen,"With proud thanksgiving, a mother for her children,
England mourns for her dead across the sea.
Flesh of her flesh they were, spirit of her spirit,
Fallen in the cause of the free.
Solemn the drums thrill: Death august and royal
Sings sorrow up into immortal spheres.
There is a music in the midst of desolation
And a glory that shines upon our tears.
They went with songs to the battle, they were young,
Straight of limb, true of eye, steady and aglow.
They were staunch to the end against odds uncountered:
They fell with their faces to the foe.
They shall grow not old, as we that are left grow old:
Age shall not weary them, nor the years condemn.
At the going down of the sun and in the morning
We will remember them.
They mingle not with their laughing comrades again;
They sit no more at familiar tables at home;
They have no lot in our labour of the day-time;
They sleep beyond England's foam.
But where our desires are and our hopes profound,
Felt as a well-spring that is hidden from sight,
To the innermost heart of their own land they are known
As the stars are known to the Night;
As the stars that shall be bright when we are dust,
Moving in marches upon the heavenly plain;
As the stars are starry in the time of our darkness,
To the end, to the end they remain."
Not to Keep,"They sent him back to her. The letter came
Saying... and she could have him. And before
She could be sure there was no hidden ill
Under the formal writing, he was in her sight—
Living.— They gave him back to her alive—
How else? They are not known to send the dead—
And not disfigured visibly. His face?—
His hands? She had to look—to ask,
“What was it, dear?” And she had given all
And still she had all—they had—they the lucky!
Wasn’t she glad now? Everything seemed won,
And all the rest for them permissible ease.
She had to ask, ""What was it, dear?""
                                                               “Enough,
Yet not enough. A bullet through and through,
High in the breast. Nothing but what good care
And medicine and rest—and you a week,
Can cure me of to go again.” The same
Grim giving to do over for them both.
She dared no more than ask him with her eyes
How was it with him for a second trial.
And with his eyes he asked her not to ask.
They had given him back to her, but not to keep. "
"The Canterbury Tales, “The Nun’s Priest’s Tale” [Excerpt]","This Chanticleer stood high upon his toes,
Stretching his neck, and both his eyes did close,
And so did crow right loudly, for the nonce;
And Russel Fox, he started up at once,
And by the gorget grabbed our Chanticleer,
Flung him on back, and toward the wood did steer,
For there was no man who as yet pursued.
O destiny, you cannot be eschewed!
Alas, that Chanticleer flew from the beams!
Alas, his wife recked nothing of his dreams!
     This simple widow and her daughters two
Heard these hens cry and make so great ado,
And out of doors they started on the run
And saw the fox into the grove just gone,
Bearing in his mouth the cock away.
And then they cried, “Alas, and weladay!
Oh, the fox!” and after him they ran,
And after them, with staves, went many a man;
Ran Coll, our dog, and Talbot and Garland,
Ran cow and calf and even the very hogs,
So were they scared by barking of the dogs
And shouting men and women all did make,
They all ran so they thought their hearts would break.
And now, good men, I pray you hearken all.
     Behold how Fortune turns all suddenly
The hope and pride of even her enemy!
This cock, which now lay in the fox’s mouth,
In all his fear unto the fox did clack
And say: “Sir, were I you, as I should be,
Then would I say (as God may now help me!),
‘Turn back again, presumptuous peasants all!
A very pestilence upon you fall!
Now that I've gained here to this dark wood’s side,
In spite of you this cock shall here abide.
I’ll eat him, by my faith, and that anon!’”
The fox replied: “In faith, it shall be done!”
And as he spoke that word, all suddenly
This cock broke from his mouth, full cleverly,
And high upon a tree he flew anon.
And when the fox saw well that he was gone,
“Alas,” quoth he, “O Chanticleer, alas!
I have against you done a base trespass
Inasmuch as I made you afeared
When I seized you and brought you from the yard;
But, sir, I did it with no foul intent;
Come down, and I will tell you what I meant.
I’ll tell the truth to you, God help me so!
“Nay then,” said he, “beshrew us both, you know,
But first, beshrew myself, both blood and bones,
If you beguile me, having done so once,
You shall no more, with any flattery,
Cause me to sing and closeup either eye;
For he who shuts his eyes when he should see,
And wilfully, God let him ne’er be free!”
“Nay,” said the fox, “but God give him mischance
Who is so indiscreet in governance
He chatters when he ought to hold his peace.”
     But you that hold this tale a foolery,
As but about a fox, a cock, a hen,
Yet do not miss the moral, my good men.
For Saint Paul says that all that's written well
Is written down some useful truth to tell.
Then take the wheat and let the chaff lie still.
     And now, good God, and if it be Thy will,
As says Lord Christ, so make us all good men
And bring us into His high bliss. Amen."
The Creation,"And God stepped out on space,
And he looked around and said:
I'm lonely—
I'll make me a world.
And far as the eye of God could see
Darkness covered everything,
Blacker than a hundred midnights
Down in a cypress swamp.
Then God smiled,
And the light broke,
And the darkness rolled up on one side,
And the light stood shining on the other,
And God said: That's good!
Then God reached out and took the light in his hands,
And God rolled the light around in his hands
Until he made the sun;
And he set that sun a-blazing in the heavens.
And the light that was left from making the sun
God gathered it up in a shining ball
And flung it against the darkness,
Spangling the night with the moon and stars.
Then down between
The darkness and the light
He hurled the world;
And God said: That's good!
Then God himself stepped down—
And the sun was on his right hand,
And the moon was on his left;
The stars were clustered about his head,
And the earth was under his feet.
And God walked, and where he trod
His footsteps hollowed the valleys out
And bulged the mountains up.
Then he stopped and looked and saw
That the earth was hot and barren.
So God stepped over to the edge of the world
And he spat out the seven seas—
He batted his eyes, and the lightnings flashed—
He clapped his hands, and the thunders rolled—
And the waters above the earth came down,
The cooling waters came down.
Then the green grass sprouted,
And the little red flowers blossomed,
The pine tree pointed his finger to the sky,
And the oak spread out his arms,
The lakes cuddled down in the hollows of the ground,
And the rivers ran down to the sea;
And God smiled again,
And the rainbow appeared,
And curled itself around his shoulder.
Then God raised his arm and he waved his hand
Over the sea and over the land,
And he said: Bring forth! Bring forth!
And quicker than God could drop his hand,
Fishes and fowls
And beasts and birds
Swam the rivers and the seas,
Roamed the forests and the woods,
And split the air with their wings.
And God said: That's good!
Then God walked around,
And God looked around
On all that he had made.
He looked at his sun,
And he looked at his moon,
And he looked at his little stars;
He looked on his world
With all its living things,
And God said: I'm lonely still.
Then God sat down—
On the side of a hill where he could think;
By a deep, wide river he sat down;
With his head in his hands,
God thought and thought,
Till he thought: I'll make me a man!
Up from the bed of the river
God scooped the clay;
And by the bank of the river
He kneeled him down;
And there the great God Almighty
Who lit the sun and fixed it in the sky,
Who flung the stars to the most far corner of the night,
Who rounded the earth in the middle of his hand;
This great God,
Like a mammy bending over her baby,
Kneeled down in the dust
Toiling over a lump of clay
Till he shaped it in is his own image;
Then into it he blew the breath of life,
And man became a living soul.
Amen.      Amen."
Dream Song 1,"Huffy Henry hid    the day,
unappeasable Henry sulked.
I see his point,—a trying to put things over.
It was the thought that they thought
they could do it made Henry wicked & away.
But he should have come out and talked.
All the world like a woolen lover
once did seem on Henry's side.
Then came a departure.
Thereafter nothing fell out as it might or ought.
I don't see how Henry, pried
open for all the world to see, survived.
What he has now to say is a long
wonder the world can bear & be.
Once in a sycamore I was glad
all at the top, and I sang.
Hard on the land wears the strong sea
and empty grows every bed."

We real cool. We
Left school. We
Lurk late. We
Strike straight. We

Thin gin. We

Die soon."
My Heart Leaps Up,"My heart leaps up when I behold 
   A rainbow in the sky:
So was it when my life began; 
So is it now I am a man; 
So be it when I shall grow old, 
   Or let me die!
The Child is father of the Man;
And I could wish my days to be
Bound each to each by natural piety.

"I, Too","I, too, sing America.
I am the darker brother.
They send me to eat in the kitchen
When company comes,
But I laugh,
And eat well,
And grow strong.
Tomorrow,
I'll be at the table
When company comes.
Nobody'll dare
Say to me,
“Eat in the kitchen,”
Then.
Besides,
They'll see how beautiful I am
And be ashamed—
I, too, am America."
The Bells,"I.
        Hear the sledges with the bells—
                 Silver bells!
What a world of merriment their melody foretells!
        How they tinkle, tinkle, tinkle,
           In the icy air of night!
        While the stars that oversprinkle
        All the heavens, seem to twinkle
           With a crystalline delight;
         Keeping time, time, time,
         In a sort of Runic rhyme,
To the tintinabulation that so musically wells
       From the bells, bells, bells, bells,
               Bells, bells, bells—
  From the jingling and the tinkling of the bells.
II.
        Hear the mellow wedding bells,
                 Golden bells!
What a world of happiness their harmony foretells!
        Through the balmy air of night
        How they ring out their delight!
           From the molten-golden notes,
               And all in tune,
           What a liquid ditty floats
    To the turtle-dove that listens, while she gloats
               On the moon!
         Oh, from out the sounding cells,
What a gush of euphony voluminously wells!
               How it swells!
               How it dwells
           On the Future! how it tells
           Of the rapture that impels
         To the swinging and the ringing
           Of the bells, bells, bells,
         Of the bells, bells, bells, bells,
               Bells, bells, bells—
  To the rhyming and the chiming of the bells!
III.
         Hear the loud alarum bells—
                 Brazen bells!
What tale of terror, now, their turbulency tells!
       In the startled ear of night
       How they scream out their affright!
         Too much horrified to speak,
         They can only shriek, shriek,
                  Out of tune,
In a clamorous appealing to the mercy of the fire,
In a mad expostulation with the deaf and frantic fire,
            Leaping higher, higher, higher,
            With a desperate desire,
         And a resolute endeavor
         Now—now to sit or never,
       By the side of the pale-faced moon.
            Oh, the bells, bells, bells!
            What a tale their terror tells
                  Of Despair!
       How they clang, and clash, and roar!
       What a horror they outpour
On the bosom of the palpitating air!
       Yet the ear it fully knows,
            By the twanging,
            And the clanging,
         How the danger ebbs and flows;
       Yet the ear distinctly tells,
            In the jangling,
            And the wrangling.
       How the danger sinks and swells,
By the sinking or the swelling in the anger of the bells—
             Of the bells—
     Of the bells, bells, bells, bells,
            Bells, bells, bells—
 In the clamor and the clangor of the bells!
IV.
          Hear the tolling of the bells—
                 Iron bells!
What a world of solemn thought their monody compels!
        In the silence of the night,
        How we shiver with affright
  At the melancholy menace of their tone!
        For every sound that floats
        From the rust within their throats
                 Is a groan.
        And the people—ah, the people—
       They that dwell up in the steeple,
                 All alone,
        And who tolling, tolling, tolling,
          In that muffled monotone,
         Feel a glory in so rolling
          On the human heart a stone—
     They are neither man nor woman—
     They are neither brute nor human—
              They are Ghouls:
        And their king it is who tolls;
        And he rolls, rolls, rolls,
                    Rolls
             A pæan from the bells!
          And his merry bosom swells
             With the pæan of the bells!
          And he dances, and he yells;
          Keeping time, time, time,
          In a sort of Runic rhyme,
             To the pæan of the bells—
               Of the bells:
          Keeping time, time, time,
          In a sort of Runic rhyme,
            To the throbbing of the bells—
          Of the bells, bells, bells—
            To the sobbing of the bells;
          Keeping time, time, time,
            As he knells, knells, knells,
          In a happy Runic rhyme,
            To the rolling of the bells—
          Of the bells, bells, bells—
            To the tolling of the bells,
      Of the bells, bells, bells, bells—
              Bells, bells, bells—
  To the moaning and the groaning of the bells."
A Far Cry from Africa,"A wind is ruffling the tawny pelt
Of Africa. Kikuyu, quick as flies,
Batten upon the bloodstreams of the veldt.
Corpses are scattered through a paradise.
Only the worm, colonel of carrion, cries:
""Waste no compassion on these separate dead!""
Statistics justify and scholars seize
The salients of colonial policy.
What is that to the white child hacked in bed?
To savages, expendable as Jews?
Threshed out by beaters, the long rushes break
In a white dust of ibises whose cries
Have wheeled since civilization's dawn
From the parched river or beast-teeming plain.
The violence of beast on beast is read
As natural law, but upright man
Seeks his divinity by inflicting pain.
Delirious as these worried beasts, his wars
Dance to the tightened carcass of a drum,
While he calls courage still that native dread
Of the white peace contracted by the dead.
Again brutish necessity wipes its hands
Upon the napkin of a dirty cause, again
A waste of our compassion, as with Spain,
The gorilla wrestles with the superman.
I who am poisoned with the blood of both,
Where shall I turn, divided to the vein?
I who have cursed
The drunken officer of British rule, how choose
Between this Africa and the English tongue I love?
Betray them both, or give back what they give?
How can I face such slaughter and be cool?
How can I turn from Africa and live?"
There Will Come Soft Rains,"(War Time)
There will come soft rains and the smell of the ground,
And swallows circling with their shimmering sound;
And frogs in the pools singing at night,
And wild plum trees in tremulous white,
Robins will wear their feathery fire
Whistling their whims on a low fence-wire;
And not one will know of the war, not one
Will care at last when it is done.
Not one would mind, neither bird nor tree
If mankind perished utterly;
And Spring herself, when she woke at dawn,
Would scarcely know that we were gone."
"somewhere i have never travelled,gladly beyond","somewhere i have never travelled, gladly beyond
any experience, your eyes have their silence:
in your most frail gesture are things which enclose me,
or which i cannot touch because they are too near
your slightest look easily will unclose me
though i have closed myself as fingers,
you open always petal by petal myself as Spring opens
(touching skillfully, mysteriously) her first rose
or if your wish be to close me, i and
my life will shut very beautifully, suddenly,
as when the heart of this flower imagines
the snow carefully everywhere descending;
nothing which we are to perceive in this world equals
the power of your intense fragility: whose texture
compels me with the colour of its countries,
rendering death and forever with each breathing
(i do not know what it is about you that closes
and opens; only something in me understands
the voice of your eyes is deeper than all roses)
nobody, not even the rain, has such small hands"
Hope is the thing with feathers (254),"Hope is the thing with feathers
That perches in the soul,
And sings the tune without the words,
And never stops at all,
And sweetest in the gale is heard;
And sore must be the storm
That could abash the little bird
That kept so many warm.
I've heard it in the chillest land,
And on the strangest sea;
Yet, never, in extremity,
It asked a crumb of me."
Remember,"Remember the sky that you were born under,
know each of the star’s stories.
Remember the moon, know who she is.
Remember the sun’s birth at dawn, that is the
strongest point of time. Remember sundown
and the giving away to night.
Remember your birth, how your mother struggled
to give you form and breath. You are evidence of
her life, and her mother’s, and hers.
Remember your father. He is your life, also.
Remember the earth whose skin you are:
red earth, black earth, yellow earth, white earth
brown earth, we are earth.
Remember the plants, trees, animal life who all have their
tribes, their families, their histories, too. Talk to them,
listen to them. They are alive poems.
Remember the wind. Remember her voice. She knows the
origin of this universe.
Remember you are all people and all people
are you.
Remember you are this universe and this
universe is you.
Remember all is in motion, is growing, is you.
Remember language comes from this.
Remember the dance language is, that life is.
Remember."

Diving into the Wreck,"First having read the book of myths,
and loaded the camera,
and checked the edge of the knife-blade,
I put on
the body-armor of black rubber
the absurd flippers
the grave and awkward mask.
I am having to do this
not like Cousteau with his
assiduous team
aboard the sun-flooded schooner
but here alone.
There is a ladder.
The ladder is always there
hanging innocently
close to the side of the schooner.
We know what it is for,
we who have used it.
Otherwise
it is a piece of maritime floss
some sundry equipment.
I go down.
Rung after rung and still
the oxygen immerses me
the blue light
the clear atoms
of our human air.
I go down.
My flippers cripple me,
I crawl like an insect down the ladder
and there is no one
to tell me when the ocean
will begin.
First the air is blue and then
it is bluer and then green and then
black I am blacking out and yet
my mask is powerful
it pumps my blood with power
the sea is another story
the sea is not a question of power
I have to learn alone
to turn my body without force
in the deep element.
And now: it is easy to forget
what I came for
among so many who have always
lived here
swaying their crenellated fans
between the reefs
and besides
you breathe differently down here.
I came to explore the wreck.
The words are purposes.
The words are maps.
I came to see the damage that was done
and the treasures that prevail.
I stroke the beam of my lamp
slowly along the flank
of something more permanent
than fish or weed
the thing I came for:
the wreck and not the story of the wreck
the thing itself and not the myth
the drowned face always staring
toward the sun
the evidence of damage
worn by salt and sway into this threadbare beauty
the ribs of the disaster
curving their assertion
among the tentative haunters.
This is the place.
And I am here, the mermaid whose dark hair
streams black, the merman in his armored body.
We circle silently
about the wreck
we dive into the hold.
I am she: I am he
whose drowned face sleeps with open eyes
whose breasts still bear the stress
whose silver, copper, vermeil cargo lies
obscurely inside barrels
half-wedged and left to rot
we are the half-destroyed instruments
that once held to a course
the water-eaten log
the fouled compass
We are, I am, you are
by cowardice or courage
the one who find our way
back to this scene
carrying a knife, a camera
a book of myths
in which
our names do not appear."
A Time to Talk,"When a friend calls to me from the road
And slows his horse to a meaning walk,
I don’t stand still and look around
On all the hills I haven’t hoed,
And shout from where I am, What is it?
No, not as there is a time to talk.
I thrust my hoe in the mellow ground,
Blade-end up and five feet tall,
And plod: I go up to the stone wall
For a friendly visit."
On Pain,"And a woman spoke, saying, Tell us of Pain.
     And he said:
     Your pain is the breaking of the shell that encloses your understanding.
     Even as the stone of the fruit must break, that its heart may stand in the sun, so must you know pain.
     And could you keep your heart in wonder at the daily miracles of your life your pain would not seem less wondrous than your joy;
     And you would accept the seasons of your heart, even as you have always accepted the seasons that pass over your fields.
     And you would watch with serenity through the winters of your grief.

     Much of your pain is self-chosen.
     It is the bitter potion by which the physician within you heals your sick self.
     Therefore trust the physician, and drink his remedy in silence and tranquility:
     For his hand, though heavy and hard, is guided by the tender hand of the Unseen,
     And the cup he brings, though it burn your lips, has been fashioned of the clay which the Potter has moistened with His own sacred tears. "
Elegy Written in a Country Churchyard,"The curfew tolls the knell of parting day,  
  The lowing herd winds slowly o'er the lea,  
The ploughman homeward plods his weary way,  
  And leaves the world to darkness and to me.  
  
Now fades the glimmering landscape on the sight,           
  And all the air a solemn stillness holds,  
Save where the beetle wheels his droning flight,  
  And drowsy tinklings lull the distant folds:  
  
Save that from yonder ivy-mantled tower  
  The moping owl does to the moon complain            
Of such as, wandering near her secret bower,  
  Molest her ancient solitary reign.  
  
Beneath those rugged elms, that yew-tree's shade  
  Where heaves the turf in many a mouldering heap,  
Each in his narrow cell for ever laid,            
  The rude Forefathers of the hamlet sleep.  
  
The breezy call of incense-breathing morn,  
  The swallow twittering from the straw-built shed,  
The cock's shrill clarion, or the echoing horn,  
  No more shall rouse them from their lowly bed.            
  
For them no more the blazing hearth shall burn  
  Or busy housewife ply her evening care:  
No children run to lisp their sire's return,  
  Or climb his knees the envied kiss to share.  
  
Oft did the harvest to their sickle yield,            
  Their furrow oft the stubborn glebe has broke;  
How jocund did they drive their team afield!  
  How bow'd the woods beneath their sturdy stroke!  
  
Let not Ambition mock their useful toil,  
  Their homely joys, and destiny obscure;            
Nor Grandeur hear with a disdainful smile  
  The short and simple annals of the Poor.  
  
The boast of heraldry, the pomp of power,  
  And all that beauty, all that wealth e'er gave  
Awaits alike th' inevitable hour:—            
  The paths of glory lead but to the grave.  
  
Nor you, ye Proud, impute to these the fault  
  If Memory o'er their tomb no trophies raise,  
Where through the long-drawn aisle and fretted vault  
  The pealing anthem swells the note of praise.            
  
Can storied urn or animated bust  
  Back to its mansion call the fleeting breath,  
Can Honour's voice provoke the silent dust,  
  Or Flattery soothe the dull cold ear of Death?  
  
Perhaps in this neglected spot is laid            
  Some heart once pregnant with celestial fire;  
Hands, that the rod of empire might have sway'd,  
  Or waked to ecstasy the living lyre:  
  
But Knowledge to their eyes her ample page,  
  Rich with the spoils of time, did ne'er unroll;            
Chill Penury repress'd their noble rage,  
  And froze the genial current of the soul.  
  
Full many a gem of purest ray serene  
  The dark unfathom'd caves of ocean bear:  
Full many a flower is born to blush unseen,            
  And waste its sweetness on the desert air.  
  
Some village-Hampden, that with dauntless breast  
  The little tyrant of his fields withstood,  
Some mute inglorious Milton here may rest,  
  Some Cromwell, guiltless of his country's blood.            
  
Th' applause of listening senates to command,  
  The threats of pain and ruin to despise,  
To scatter plenty o'er a smiling land,  
  And read their history in a nation's eyes  
  
Their lot forbad: nor circumscribed alone            
  Their growing virtues, but their crimes confined;  
Forbad to wade through slaughter to a throne,  
  And shut the gates of mercy on mankind;  
  
The struggling pangs of conscious truth to hide,  
  To quench the blushes of ingenuous shame,            
Or heap the shrine of Luxury and Pride  
  With incense kindled at the Muse's flame.  
  
Far from the madding crowd's ignoble strife  
  Their sober wishes never learn'd to stray;  
Along the cool sequester'd vale of life            
  They kept the noiseless tenour of their way.  
  
Yet e'en these bones from insult to protect  
  Some frail memorial still erected nigh,  
With uncouth rhymes and shapeless sculpture deck'd,  
  Implores the passing tribute of a sigh.            
  
Their name, their years, spelt by th' unletter'd Muse,  
  The place of fame and elegy supply:  
And many a holy text around she strews,  
  That teach the rustic moralist to die.  
  
For who, to dumb forgetfulness a prey,            
  This pleasing anxious being e'er resign'd,  
Left the warm precincts of the cheerful day,  
  Nor cast one longing lingering look behind?  
  
On some fond breast the parting soul relies,  
  Some pious drops the closing eye requires;            
E'en from the tomb the voice of Nature cries,  
  E'en in our ashes live their wonted fires.  
  
For thee, who, mindful of th' unhonour'd dead,  
  Dost in these lines their artless tale relate;  
If chance, by lonely Contemplation led,            
  Some kindred spirit shall enquire thy fate,— 
  
Haply some hoary-headed swain may say,  
  'Oft have we seen him at the peep of dawn  
Brushing with hasty steps the dews away,  
  To meet the sun upon the upland lawn;             
  
'There at the foot of yonder nodding beech  
  That wreathes its old fantastic roots so high,  
His listless length at noon-tide would he stretch,  
  And pore upon the brook that babbles by.  
  
'Hard by yon wood, now smiling as in scorn,             
  Muttering his wayward fancies he would rove;  
Now drooping, woeful-wan, like one forlorn,  
  Or crazed with care, or cross'd in hopeless love.  
  
'One morn I miss'd him on the custom'd hill,  
  Along the heath, and near his favourite tree;             
Another came; nor yet beside the rill,  
  Nor up the lawn, nor at the wood was he;  
  
'The next with dirges due in sad array  
  Slow through the church-way path we saw him borne,—
Approach and read (for thou canst read) the lay             
  Graved on the stone beneath yon agèd thorn:'  
  
The Epitaph

Here rests his head upon the lap of Earth  
  A youth, to Fortune and to Fame unknown;  
Fair Science frown'd not on his humble birth  
  And Melancholy mark'd him for her own.             
  
Large was his bounty, and his soul sincere;  
  Heaven did a recompense as largely send:  
He gave to Mis'ry all he had, a tear,  
  He gain'd from Heaven, 'twas all he wish'd, a friend.  
  
No farther seek his merits to disclose,             
  Or draw his frailties from their dread abode,  
(There they alike in trembling hope repose,)  
  The bosom of his Father and his God."
"In the chemo room, I wear mittens made of ice so I don’t lose my fingernails. But I took a risk today to write this down.","Whenever I spend the day crying, 
my friends tell me I look high. Good grief,  
they finally understand me.  
Even when the arena is empty, I thank god  
for the shots I miss. If you ever catch me  
only thanking god for the shots I make,  
remind me I’m not thanking god. Remind me  
all my prayers were answered  
the moment I started praying  
for what I already have.  
Jenny says when people ask if she’s out of the woods,  
she tells them she’ll never be out of the woods,  
says there is something lovely about the woods.  
I know how to build a survival shelter  
from fallen tree branches, packed mud,  
and pulled moss. I could survive forever  
on death alone. Wasn’t it death that taught me  
to stop measuring my lifespan by length,
but by width? Do you know how many beautiful things  
can be seen in a single second? How you can blow up
a second like a balloon and fit infinity inside of it? 
I’m infinite, I know, but I still have a measly wrinkle
collection compared to my end goal. I would love  
to be a before picture, I think, as I look in the mirror
and mistake my head for the moon. My dark  
thoughts are almost always 238,856 miles away 
from me believing them. I love this life, 
I whisper into my doctor’s stethoscope
so she can hear my heart. My heart, an heirloom
I didn’t inherit until I thought I could die.
Why did I go so long believing I owed the world
my disappointment? Why did I want to take
the world by storm when I could have taken it
by sunshine, by rosewater, by the cactus flowers
on the side of the road where I broke down?
I’m not about to waste more time
spinning stories about how much time
I’m owed, but there is a man
who is usually here, who isn’t today.  
I don’t know if he’s still alive. I just know
his wife was made of so much hope  
she looked like a firework above his chair.
Will the afterlife be harder if I remember
the people I love, or forget them?
Either way, please let me remember."
Trees,"I think that I shall never see
A poem lovely as a tree.
A tree whose hungry mouth is prest
Against the earth's sweet flowing breast;
A tree that looks at God all day,
And lifts her leafy arms to pray;
A tree that may in summer wear
A nest of robins in her hair;
Upon whose bosom snow has lain;
Who intimately lives with rain.
Poems are made by fools like me,
But only God can make a tree."
On the Pulse of Morning,"A Rock, A River, A Tree
Hosts to species long since departed,
Marked the mastodon,
The dinosaur, who left dried tokens
Of their sojourn here
On our planet floor,
Any broad alarm of their hastening doom
Is lost in the gloom of dust and ages.
But today, the Rock cries out to us, clearly, forcefully,
Come, you may stand upon my
Back and face your distant destiny,
But seek no haven in my shadow.
I will give you no hiding place down here.
You, created only a little lower than
The angels, have crouched too long in
The bruising darkness
Have lain too long
Face down in ignorance.
Your mouths spilling words
Armed for slaughter.
The Rock cries out to us today, you may stand upon me,
But do not hide your face.
Across the wall of the world,
A River sings a beautiful song. It says,
Come, rest here by my side.
Each of you, a bordered country,
Delicate and strangely made proud,
Yet thrusting perpetually under siege.
Your armed struggles for profit
Have left collars of waste upon
My shore, currents of debris upon my breast.
Yet today I call you to my riverside,
If you will study war no more. Come,
Clad in peace, and I will sing the songs
The Creator gave to me when I and the
Tree and the rock were one.
Before cynicism was a bloody sear across your
Brow and when you yet knew you still
Knew nothing.
The River sang and sings on.
There is a true yearning to respond to
The singing River and the wise Rock.
So say the Asian, the Hispanic, the Jew
The African, the Native American, the Sioux,
The Catholic, the Muslim, the French, the Greek
The Irish, the Rabbi, the Priest, the Sheik,
The Gay, the Straight, the Preacher,
The privileged, the homeless, the Teacher.
They hear. They all hear
The speaking of the Tree.
They hear the first and last of every Tree
Speak to humankind today. Come to me, here beside the River.
Plant yourself beside the River.
Each of you, descendant of some passed
On traveller, has been paid for.
You, who gave me my first name, you,
Pawnee, Apache, Seneca, you
Cherokee Nation, who rested with me, then
Forced on bloody feet,
Left me to the employment of
Other seekers—desperate for gain,
Starving for gold.
You, the Turk, the Arab, the Swede, the German, the Eskimo, the Scot,
You the Ashanti, the Yoruba, the Kru, bought,
Sold, stolen, arriving on the nightmare
Praying for a dream.
Here, root yourselves beside me.
I am that Tree planted by the River,
Which will not be moved.
I, the Rock, I the River, I the Tree
I am yours—your passages have been paid.
Lift up your faces, you have a piercing need
For this bright morning dawning for you.
History, despite its wrenching pain
Cannot be unlived, but if faced
With courage, need not be lived again.
Lift up your eyes upon
This day breaking for you.
Give birth again
To the dream.
Women, children, men,
Take it into the palms of your hands,
Mold it into the shape of your most
Private need. Sculpt it into
The image of your most public self.
Lift up your hearts
Each new hour holds new chances
For a new beginning.
Do not be wedded forever
To fear, yoked eternally
To brutishness.
The horizon leans forward,
Offering you space to place new steps of change.
Here, on the pulse of this fine day
You may have the courage
To look up and out and upon me, the
Rock, the River, the Tree, your country.
No less to Midas than the mendicant.
No less to you now than the mastodon then.
Here, on the pulse of this new day
You may have the grace to look up and out
And into your sister’s eyes, and into
Your brother’s face, your country
And say simply
Very simply
With hope—
Good morning."
Good Bones,"Life is short, though I keep this from my children.
Life is short, and I’ve shortened mine
in a thousand delicious, ill-advised ways,
a thousand deliciously ill-advised ways
I’ll keep from my children. The world is at least
fifty percent terrible, and that’s a conservative
estimate, though I keep this from my children.
For every bird there is a stone thrown at a bird.
For every loved child, a child broken, bagged,
sunk in a lake. Life is short and the world
is at least half terrible, and for every kind
stranger, there is one who would break you,
though I keep this from my children. I am trying
to sell them the world. Any decent realtor,
walking you through a real shithole, chirps on
about good bones: This place could be beautiful,
right? You could make this place beautiful."
So we'll go no more a roving,"So, we'll go no more a roving
    So late into the night,
Though the heart be still as loving,
    And the moon be still as bright.

For the sword outwears its sheath,
    And the soul wears out the breast,
And the heart must pause to breathe,
    And love itself have rest.

Though the night was made for loving,
    And the day returns too soon,
Yet we'll go no more a roving
    By the light of the moon."
To the Sea,"Sometimes when you start to ramble
or rather when you feel you are starting to ramble
you will say Well, now I’m rambling
though I don’t think you ever are.
And if you ever are I don’t really care.
And not just because I and everyone really 
at times falls into our own unspooling
—which really I think is a beautiful softness
of being human, trying to show someone else
the color of all our threads, wanting another to know 
everything in us we are trying to show them—
but in the specific, 
in the specific of you
here in this car that you are driving
and in which I am sitting beside you
with regards to you 
and your specific mouth
parting to give way
to the specific sweetness that is
the water of your voice 
tumbling forth—like I said 
I don’t ever really mind
how much more 
you might keep speaking
as it simply means 
I get to hear you 
speak for longer. 
What was a stream 
now a river."
Enough,"You are enough
Divinity flows in your fingertips
        with light so radiant
        every beat of your heart
a victory march
made of whole universes
        stitched by the hands of creation
        with flawless design
a prophecy You fulfill perfectly with every breath
        You
The sun wouldn’t shine the same without it
Creation is only waiting for You
                to smile back at it
Do you see it yet?
You are enough
        For the birds to sing about
        For the seeds to sprout about
        For the stars to shoot about
        Do you see it yet?
        Gardens in your speech
Fields of wildflowers in your prayers
        Lighthouses in your eyes
    No one else can see it for you
You have always been enough
You will always be enough
Your simple act of being is enough
            Do you see it yet?"
The Soul has Bandaged moments (360),"The Soul has Bandaged moments –
When too appalled to stir –
She feels some ghastly Fright come up
And stop to look at her –
Salute her, with long fingers –
Caress her freezing hair –
Sip, Goblin, from the very lips
The Lover – hovered – o’er –
Unworthy, that a thought so mean
Accost a Theme – so – fair ­–
The soul has moments of escape –
When bursting all the doors –
She dances like a Bomb, abroad,
And swings opon the Hours,
As do the Bee – delirious borne –
Long Dungeoned from his Rose –
Touch Liberty – then know no more,
But Noon, and Paradise –
The Soul’s retaken moments –
When, Felon led along,
With shackles on the plumed feet,
And staples, in the song,
The Horror welcomes her, again,
These, are not brayed of Tongue –"
Fern Hill,"Now as I was young and easy under the apple boughs
About the lilting house and happy as the grass was green,
     The night above the dingle starry,
          Time let me hail and climb
     Golden in the heydays of his eyes,
And honoured among wagons I was prince of the apple towns
And once below a time I lordly had the trees and leaves
          Trail with daisies and barley
     Down the rivers of the windfall light.
And as I was green and carefree, famous among the barns
About the happy yard and singing as the farm was home,
     In the sun that is young once only,
          Time let me play and be
     Golden in the mercy of his means,
And green and golden I was huntsman and herdsman, the calves
Sang to my horn, the foxes on the hills barked clear and cold,
          And the sabbath rang slowly
     In the pebbles of the holy streams.
All the sun long it was running, it was lovely, the hay
Fields high as the house, the tunes from the chimneys, it was air
     And playing, lovely and watery
          And fire green as grass.
     And nightly under the simple stars
As I rode to sleep the owls were bearing the farm away,
All the moon long I heard, blessed among stables, the nightjars
     Flying with the ricks, and the horses
          Flashing into the dark.
And then to awake, and the farm, like a wanderer white
With the dew, come back, the cock on his shoulder: it was all
     Shining, it was Adam and maiden,
          The sky gathered again
     And the sun grew round that very day.
So it must have been after the birth of the simple light
In the first, spinning place, the spellbound horses walking warm
     Out of the whinnying green stable
          On to the fields of praise.
And honoured among foxes and pheasants by the gay house
Under the new made clouds and happy as the heart was long,
     In the sun born over and over,
          I ran my heedless ways,
     My wishes raced through the house high hay
And nothing I cared, at my sky blue trades, that time allows
In all his tuneful turning so few and such morning songs
     Before the children green and golden
          Follow him out of grace,
Nothing I cared, in the lamb white days, that time would take me
Up to the swallow thronged loft by the shadow of my hand,
     In the moon that is always rising,
          Nor that riding to sleep
     I should hear him fly with the high fields
And wake to the farm forever fled from the childless land.
Oh as I was young and easy in the mercy of his means,
          Time held me green and dying
     Though I sang in my chains like the sea."
i know the grandmother one had hands,"i know the grandmother one had hands
but they were always in bowls
folding, pinching, rolling the dough
making the bread
i know the grandmother one had hands
but they were always under water
sifting rice
bluing clothes
starching lives
i know the grandmother one had hands
but they were always in the earth
planting seeds
removing weeds
growing knives
burying sons
i know the grandmother one had hands
but they were always under
the cloth
pushing it along
helping it birth into

dress
curtains to lock out
night
i know the grandmother one had hands
but they were always inside
the hair
parting
plaiting
twisting it into rainbows
i know the grandmother one had hands
but they were always inside
pockets
holding the knots
counting the twisted veins
holding onto herself
let her hands disappear
into sky
i know the grandmother one had hands

poking holes for

Resignation,"I love you
            because the Earth turns round the sun
            because the North wind blows north
                 sometimes
            because the Pope is Catholic
                 and most Rabbis Jewish
            because the winters flow into springs
                 and the air clears after a storm
            because only my love for you
                 despite the charms of gravity
                 keeps me from falling off this Earth
                 into another dimension
I love you
            because it is the natural order of things
I love you
            like the habit I picked up in college
                 of sleeping through lectures
                 or saying I’m sorry
                 when I get stopped for speeding
            because I drink a glass of water
                 in the morning
                 and chain-smoke cigarettes
                 all through the day
            because I take my coffee Black
                 and my milk with chocolate
            because you keep my feet warm
                 though my life a mess
I love you
            because I don’t want it
                 any other way
I am helpless
            in my love for you
It makes me so happy
            to hear you call my name
I am amazed you can resist
            locking me in an echo chamber
            where your voice reverberates
            through the four walls
            sending me into spasmatic ecstasy
I love you
            because it’s been so good
            for so long
            that if I didn’t love you
            I’d have to be born again
            and that is not a theological statement
I am pitiful in my love for you
The Dells tell me Love
            is so simple
            the thought though of you
            sends indescribably delicious multitudinous
            thrills throughout and through-in my body
I love you
            because no two snowflakes are alike
            and it is possible
            if you stand tippy-toe
            to walk between the raindrops
I love you
            because I am afraid of the dark
                 and can’t sleep in the light
            because I rub my eyes
                 when I wake up in the morning
                 and find you there
            because you with all your magic powers were
                 determined that
I should love you
            because there was nothing for you but that
I would love you
I love you
            because you made me
                 want to love you
            more than I love my privacy
                 my freedom          my commitments
                      and responsibilities
I love you ’cause I changed my life
            to love you
            because you saw me one Friday
                 afternoon and decided that I would
love you
I love you I love you I love you"
Tea at the Palaz of Hoon,"Not less because in purple I descended
The western day through what you called
The loneliest air, not less was I myself.

What was the ointment sprinkled on my beard?
What were the hymns that buzzed beside my ears?
What was the sea whose tide swept through me there?

Out of my mind the golden ointment rained,
And my ears made the blowing hymns they heard.
I was myself the compass of that sea:

I was the world in which I walked, and what I saw
Or heard or felt came not but from myself;
And there I found myself more truly and more strange."
The Unknown Citizen,"(To JS/07 M 378
This Marble Monument
Is Erected by the State)
He was found by the Bureau of Statistics to be
One against whom there was no official complaint,
And all the reports on his conduct agree
That, in the modern sense of an old-fashioned word, he was a saint,
For in everything he did he served the Greater Community.
Except for the War till the day he retired
He worked in a factory and never got fired,
But satisfied his employers, Fudge Motors Inc.
Yet he wasn't a scab or odd in his views,
For his Union reports that he paid his dues,
(Our report on his Union shows it was sound)
And our Social Psychology workers found
That he was popular with his mates and liked a drink.
The Press are convinced that he bought a paper every day
And that his reactions to advertisements were normal in every way.
Policies taken out in his name prove that he was fully insured,
And his Health-card shows he was once in hospital but left it cured.
Both Producers Research and High-Grade Living declare
He was fully sensible to the advantages of the Instalment Plan
And had everything necessary to the Modern Man,
A phonograph, a radio, a car and a frigidaire.
Our researchers into Public Opinion are content
That he held the proper opinions for the time of year;
When there was peace, he was for peace: when there was war, he went.
He was married and added five children to the population,
Which our Eugenist says was the right number for a parent of his generation.
And our teachers report that he never interfered with their education.
Was he free? Was he happy? The question is absurd:
Had anything been wrong, we should certainly have heard."
Love is Not All (Sonnet XXX),"Love is not all: it is not meat nor drink
Nor slumber nor a roof against the rain; 
Nor yet a floating spar to men that sink 
And rise and sink and rise and sink again; 
Love can not fill the thickened lung with breath, 
Nor clean the blood, nor set the fractured bone; 
Yet many a man is making friends with death 
Even as I speak, for lack of love alone. 
It well may be that in a difficult hour, 
Pinned down by pain and moaning for release, 
Or nagged by want past resolution’s power, 
I might be driven to sell your love for peace, 
Or trade the memory of this night for food. 
It well may be. I do not think I would. "
What the Living Do,"Johnny, the kitchen sink has been clogged for days, some utensil probably fell down there.
And the Drano won’t work but smells dangerous, and the crusty dishes have piled up
waiting for the plumber I still haven’t called. This is the everyday we spoke of.
It’s winter again: the sky’s a deep, headstrong blue, and the sunlight pours through
the open living-room windows because the heat’s on too high in here and I can’t turn it off.
For weeks now, driving, or dropping a bag of groceries in the street, the bag breaking,
I’ve been thinking: This is what the living do. And yesterday, hurrying along those
wobbly bricks in the Cambridge sidewalk, spilling my coffee down my wrist and sleeve,
I thought it again, and again later, when buying a hairbrush: This is it.
Parking. Slamming the car door shut in the cold. What you called that yearning.
What you finally gave up. We want the spring to come and the winter to pass. We want
whoever to call or not call, a letter, a kiss—we want more and more and then more of it.
But there are moments, walking, when I catch a glimpse of myself in the window glass,
say, the window of the corner video store, and I'm gripped by a cherishing so deep
for my own blowing hair, chapped face, and unbuttoned coat that I’m speechless:
I am living. I remember you."
"Confessions: My Father, Hummingbirds, and Frantz Fanon","Every effort is made to bring the colonised person to admit
the inferiority of his culture...
—Frantz Fanon
And there are days when storms hover
Over my house, their brooding just this side of rage, 
An open hand about to slap a face. You won't believe me

When I tell you it is not personal. It isn't. It only feels
That way because the face is yours. So what if it is the only
Face you've got? Listen, a storm will grab the first thing 
In its path, a Persian cat, a sixth grade boy on his way home 
From school, an old woman watering her roses, a black
Man running down a street (late to a dinner with his wife), 
A white guy buying cigarettes at the corner store. A storm
Will grab a young woman trying to escape her boyfriend, 
A garbage can, a Mexican busboy with no papers, you. 
We are all collateral damage for someone's beautiful
Ideology, all of us inanimate in the face of the onslaught. 
My father had the biggest hands I've ever seen. He never
Wore a wedding ring. Somehow, it would have looked lost, 
Misplaced on his thick worker's hands that were, to me, 
As large as Africa. There have been a good many storms
In Africa over the centuries. One was called colonialism 
(Though I confess to loving Tarzan as a boy).

In my thirties,  
I read a book by Frantz Fanon. I fell in love
With the storms in his book even though they broke 
My heart and made me want to scream. What good
Is screaming? Even a bad actress in a horror flick
Can do that. In my twenties, I had fallen in love
With the storms in the essays of James Baldwin. 
They were like perfect poems. His friends called
Him Jimmy. People didn't think he was beautiful. 
Oh God, but he was. He could make a hand that was
Slapping you into something that was loving, loving you. 
He could make rage sound elegant. Have you ever
Read ""Stranger in the Village?"" How would you like
To feel like a fucking storm every time someone looked
At you? 

One time I was 
At a party. Some guy asked me: What are you, anyway?
I downed my beer. Mexican I said. Really he said, Do
You play soccer? No I said but I drink Tequila. He smiled
At me, That's cool. I smiled back So what are you?
What do you think I am he said. An asshole I said. People
Hate you when you're right. Especially if you're Mexican.
And every time I leave town, I pray that people will stop
Repeating You're from El Paso with that same tone
Of voice they use when they see a rat running across
Their living rooms, interrupting their second glass
Of scotch. My father's dead (Though sometimes I wake
And swear he has never been more alive—especially when
I see him staring back at me as I shave in the morning). 
Even though I understand something about hating a man
I have never really understood the logic of slavery.
What do I know? I don't particularly like the idea of cheap
Labor. I don't like guns. And I don't even believe
White men are superior. Do you? I wanted to be
St. Francis. I took this ambition very seriously. Instead
I wound up becoming a middle-aged man who dreams
Storms where all the animals wind up dead. It scares
Me to think I have this dream inside me. Still, 
I love dogs—even mean ones. I could forgive
A dog that bit me. But if a man bit me, that would be
Another story. I have made my peace with cats.
I am especially in love with hummingbirds (though 
They're as mean as roosters in a cock fight). Have 
You ever seen the storms in the eyes of men who
Were betting on a cock fight?

Last night, there was hail, thunder, 
A tornado touching down in the desert—though I was
Away and was not a first hand witness. I was in another
Place, listening to the waves of the ocean crash against
The shore. Sometimes I think the sea is angry. Who
Can blame it? There are a million things to be angry
About. Have you noticed that some people don't give
A damn and just keep on shopping? Doesn't that make you
Angry? A storm is like God. You don't have to see it
To believe—sometimes you just have to place
Your faith in it. When my father walked into a room
It felt like that. Like the crashing waves. You know, 
Like a storm. This is the truth of the matter: I am
The son of a storm. Look, every one has to be the son
Of something. The thing to do when you are caught
In the middle of a storm is to abandon your car, 
Keep quiet. Pray. Wait. Tell that to the men 
Who were sleeping on the Arizona when
The Japanese dropped their bombs. War is the worst 
Kind of storm. The truth is I have never met a breathing
Human being who did not have at least one scar
On his body. Bombs and bullets do more than leave
A permanent mark on the skin. I have never liked
The expression they were out for blood.  

There are days
When there are so many storms hovering around
My house that I cannot even see the blue in the sky. 
My father loved the sky. He was trying to memorize
The clouds before he died. I confess to being 
Jealous of the sky. 

On Sunday Mornings
I picture Frantz Fanon as an old man. He is looking up
At the pure African sky. He is trying to imagine how it appeared
Before the white men came. I don't want to dream all the dead
Animals we have made extinct. I want to dream a sky
Full of hummingbirds. I would like to die in such a storm."
When Lilacs Last in the Door-yard Bloom’d,"When lilacs last in the door-yard bloom’d,
And the great star early droop’d in the western sky in the night,
I mourn’d—and yet shall mourn with ever-returning spring.

O ever-returning spring! trinity sure to me you bring;
Lilac blooming perennial, and drooping star in the west,
And thought of him I love.
  2
O powerful, western, fallen star!
O shades of night! O moody, tearful night!
O great star disappear’d! O the black murk that hides the star!
O cruel hands that hold me powerless! O helpless soul of me!
O harsh surrounding cloud, that will not free my soul!
  3
In the door-yard fronting an old farm-house, near the white-wash’d palings,
Stands the lilac bush, tall-growing, with heart-shaped leaves of rich green,
With many a pointed blossom, rising, delicate, with the perfume strong I love,
With every leaf a miracle......and from this bush in the door-yard,
With delicate-color’d blossoms, and heart-shaped leaves of rich green,
A sprig, with its flower, I break.

4
In the swamp, in secluded recesses,
A shy and hidden bird is warbling a song.

Solitary, the thrush,
The hermit, withdrawn to himself, avoiding the settlements,
Sings by himself a song.

Song of the bleeding throat!
Death’s outlet song of life—(for well, dear brother, I know
If thou wast not gifted to sing, thou would’st surely die.)
  5
Over the breast of the spring, the land, amid cities,
Amid lanes, and through old woods, (where lately the violets peep’d from the ground, spotting the gray debris;)
Amid the grass in the fields each side of the lanes—passing the endless grass;
Passing the yellow-spear’d wheat, every grain from its shroud in the dark-brown fields uprising;
Passing the apple-tree blows of white and pink in the orchards;
Carrying a corpse to where it shall rest in the grave,
Night and day journeys a coffin.
  6
Coffin that passes through lanes and streets,
Through day and night, with the great cloud darkening the land,
With the pomp of the inloop’d flags, with the cities draped in black,
With the show of the States themselves, as of crape-veil’d women, standing,
With processions long and winding, and the flambeaus of the night,
With the countless torches lit—with the silent sea of faces, and the unbared heads,
With the waiting depot, the arriving coffin, and the sombre faces,
With dirges through the night, with the thousand voices rising strong and solemn;
With all the mournful voices of the dirges, pour’d around the coffin,
The dim-lit churches and the shuddering organs—Where amid these you journey,
With the tolling, tolling bells’ perpetual clang;
Here! coffin that slowly passes,
I give you my sprig of lilac.
  7
(Nor for you, for one, alone;
Blossoms and branches green to coffins all I bring:
For fresh as the morning—thus would I carol a song for you, O sane and sacred death.

All over bouquets of roses,
O death! I cover you over with roses and early lilies;
But mostly and now the lilac that blooms the first,
Copious, I break, I break the sprigs from the bushes;
With loaded arms I come, pouring for you,
For you, and the coffins all of you, O death.)
  8
O western orb, sailing the heaven!
Now I know what you must have meant, as a month since we walk’d,
As we walk’d up and down in the dark blue so mystic,
As we walk’d in silence the transparent shadowy night,
As I saw you had something to tell, as you bent to me night after night,
As you droop’d from the sky low down, as if to my side, (while the other stars all look’d on;)
As we wander’d together the solemn night, (for something, I know not what, kept me from sleep;)
As the night advanced, and I saw on the rim of the west, ere you went, how full you were of woe;
As I stood on the rising ground in the breeze, in the cold transparent night,
As I watch’d where you pass’d and was lost in the netherward black of the night,
As my soul, in its trouble, dissatisfied, sank, as where you, sad orb,
Concluded, dropt in the night, and was gone.
  9
Sing on, there in the swamp!
O singer bashful and tender! I hear your notes—I hear your call;
I hear—I come presently—I understand you;
But a moment I linger—for the lustrous star has detain’d me;
The star, my departing comrade, holds and detains me.
  10
O how shall I warble myself for the dead one there I loved?
And how shall I deck my song for the large sweet soul that has gone?
And what shall my perfume be, for the grave of him I love?

Sea-winds, blown from east and west,
Blown from the eastern sea, and blown from the western sea, till there on the prairies meeting:
These, and with these, and the breath of my chant,
I perfume the grave of him I love.
  11
O what shall I hang on the chamber walls?
And what shall the pictures be that I hang on the walls,
To adorn the burial-house of him I love?

Pictures of growing spring, and farms, and homes,
With the Fourth-month eve at sundown, and the gray smoke lucid and bright,
With floods of the yellow gold of the gorgeous, indolent, sinking sun, burning, expanding the air;
With the fresh sweet herbage under foot, and the pale green leaves of the trees prolific;
In the distance the flowing glaze, the breast of the river, with a wind-dapple here and there;
With ranging hills on the banks, with many a line against the sky, and shadows;
And the city at hand, with dwellings so dense, and stacks of chimneys,
And all the scenes of life, and the workshops, and the workmen homeward returning.
  12
Lo! body and soul! this land!
Mighty Manhattan, with spires, and the sparkling and hurrying tides, and the ships;
The varied and ample land—the South and the North in the light—Ohio’s shores, and flashing Missouri,
And ever the far-spreading prairies, cover’d with grass and corn.

Lo! the most excellent sun, so calm and haughty;
The violet and purple morn, with just-felt breezes;
The gentle, soft-born, measureless light;
The miracle, spreading, bathing all—the fulfill’d noon;
The coming eve, delicious—the welcome night, and the stars,
Over my cities shining all, enveloping man and land.
  13
Sing on! sing on, you gray-brown bird!
Sing from the swamps, the recesses—pour your chant from the bushes;
Limitless out of the dusk, out of the cedars and pines.

Sing on, dearest brother—warble your reedy song;
Loud human song, with voice of uttermost woe.

O liquid, and free, and tender!
O wild and loose to my soul! O wondrous singer!
You only I hear......yet the star holds me, (but will soon depart;)
Yet the lilac, with mastering odor, holds me.
  14
Now while I sat in the day, and look’d forth,
In the close of the day, with its light, and the fields of spring, and the farmer preparing his crops,
In the large unconscious scenery of my land, with its lakes and forests,
In the heavenly aerial beauty, (after the perturb’d winds, and the storms;)
Under the arching heavens of the afternoon swift passing, and the voices of children and women,
The many-moving sea-tides,—and I saw the ships how they sail’d,
And the summer approaching with richness, and the fields all busy with labor,
And the infinite separate houses, how they all went on, each with its meals and minutia of daily usages;
And the streets, how their throbbings throbb’d, and the cities pent—lo! then and there,
Falling upon them all, and among them all, enveloping me with the rest,
Appear’d the cloud, appear’d the long black trail;
And I knew Death, its thought, and the sacred knowledge of death.
  15
Then with the knowledge of death as walking one side of me,
And the thought of death close-walking the other side of me,
And I in the middle, as with companions, and as holding the hands of companions,
I fled forth to the hiding receiving night, that talks not,
Down to the shores of the water, the path by the swamp in the dimness,
To the solemn shadowy cedars, and ghostly pines so still.

And the singer so shy to the rest receiv’d me;
The gray-brown bird I know, receiv’d us comrades three;
And he sang what seem’d the carol of death, and a verse for him I love.

From deep secluded recesses,
From the fragrant cedars, and the ghostly pines so still,
Came the carol of the bird.

And the charm of the carol rapt me,
As I held, as if by their hands, my comrades in the night;
And the voice of my spirit tallied the song of the bird.
  16
DEATH CAROL.
Come, lovely and soothing Death,
Undulate round the world, serenely arriving, arriving,
In the day, in the night, to all, to each,
Sooner or later, delicate Death.

Prais’d be the fathomless universe,
For life and joy, and for objects and knowledge curious;
And for love, sweet love—But praise! praise! praise!
For the sure-enwinding arms of cool-enfolding Death.

Dark Mother, always gliding near, with soft feet,
Have none chanted for thee a chant of fullest welcome?

Then I chant it for thee—I glorify thee above all;
I bring thee a song that when thou must indeed come, come unfalteringly.

Approach, strong Deliveress!
When it is so—when thou hast taken them, I joyously sing the dead,
Lost in the loving, floating ocean of thee,
Laved in the flood of thy bliss, O Death.

From me to thee glad serenades,
Dances for thee I propose, saluting thee—adornments and feastings for thee;
And the sights of the open landscape, and the high-spread sky, are fitting,
And life and the fields, and the huge and thoughtful night.

The night, in silence, under many a star;
The ocean shore, and the husky whispering wave, whose voice I know;
And the soul turning to thee, O vast and well-veil’d Death,
And the body gratefully nestling close to thee.

Over the tree-tops I float thee a song!
Over the rising and sinking waves—over the myriad fields, and the prairies wide;
Over the dense-pack’d cities all, and the teeming wharves and ways,
I float this carol with joy, with joy to thee, O Death!
  17
To the tally of my soul,
Loud and strong kept up the gray-brown bird,
With pure, deliberate notes, spreading, filling the night.

Loud in the pines and cedars dim,
Clear in the freshness moist, and the swamp-perfume;
And I with my comrades there in the night.

While my sight that was bound in my eyes unclosed,
As to long panoramas of visions.


18
I saw askant the armies;
And I saw, as in noiseless dreams, hundreds of battle-flags;
Borne through the smoke of the battles, and pierc’d with missiles, I saw them,
And carried hither and yon through the smoke, and torn and bloody;
And at last but a few shreds left on the staffs, (and all in silence,)
And the staffs all splinter’d and broken.

I saw battle-corpses, myriads of them,
And the white skeletons of young men—I saw them;
I saw the debris and debris of all the dead soldiers of the war;
But I saw they were not as was thought;
They themselves were fully at rest—they suffer’d not;
The living remain’d and suffer’d—the mother suffer’d,
And the wife and the child, and the musing comrade suffer’d,
And the armies that remain’d suffer’d.


19
Passing the visions, passing the night;
Passing, unloosing the hold of my comrades’ hands;
Passing the song of the hermit bird, and the tallying song of my soul,
(Victorious song, death’s outlet song, yet varying, ever-altering song,
As low and wailing, yet clear the notes, rising and falling, flooding the night,
Sadly sinking and fainting, as warning and warning, and yet again bursting with joy,
Covering the earth, and filling the spread of the heaven,
As that powerful psalm in the night I heard from recesses,)
Passing, I leave thee, lilac with heart-shaped leaves;
I leave thee there in the door-yard, blooming, returning with spring,
I cease from my song for thee;
From my gaze on thee in the west, fronting the west, communing with thee,
O comrade lustrous, with silver face in the night.


20
Yet each I keep, and all, retrievements out of the night;
The song, the wondrous chant of the gray-brown bird,
And the tallying chant, the echo arous’d in my soul,
With the lustrous and drooping star, with the countenance full of woe,
With the lilac tall, and its blossoms of mastering odor;
With the holders holding my hand, nearing the call of the bird,
Comrades mine, and I in the midst, and their memory ever I keep—for the dead I loved so well;
For the sweetest, wisest soul of all my days and lands...and this for his dear sake;
Lilac and star and bird, twined with the chant of my soul,
There in the fragrant pines, and the cedars dusk and dim."
"Inferno, Canto I","Midway upon the journey of our life
  I found myself within a forest dark,
  For the straightforward pathway had been lost.
Ah me! how hard a thing it is to say
  What was this forest savage, rough, and stern,
  Which in the very thought renews the fear.
So bitter is it, death is little more;
  But of the good to treat, which there I found,
  Speak will I of the other things I saw there.
I cannot well repeat how there I entered,
  So full was I of slumber at the moment
  In which I had abandoned the true way.
But after I had reached a mountain’s foot,
  At that point where the valley terminated,
  Which had with consternation pierced my heart,
Upward I looked, and I beheld its shoulders,
  Vested already with that planet’s rays
  Which leadeth others right by every road.
Then was the fear a little quieted
  That in my heart’s lake had endured throughout
  The night, which I had passed so piteously.
And even as he, who, with distressful breath,
  Forth issued from the sea upon the shore,
  Turns to the water perilous and gazes;
So did my soul, that still was fleeing onward,
  Turn itself back to re-behold the pass
  Which never yet a living person left.
After my weary body I had rested,
  The way resumed I on the desert slope,
  So that the firm foot ever was the lower.
And lo! almost where the ascent began,
  A panther light and swift exceedingly,
  Which with a spotted skin was covered o’er!
And never moved she from before my face,
  Nay, rather did impede so much my way,
  That many times I to return had turned.
The time was the beginning of the morning,
  And up the sun was mounting with those stars
  That with him were, what time the Love Divine
At first in motion set those beauteous things;
  So were to me occasion of good hope,
  The variegated skin of that wild beast,
The hour of time, and the delicious season;
  But not so much, that did not give me fear
  A lion’s aspect which appeared to me.
He seemed as if against me he were coming
  With head uplifted, and with ravenous hunger,
  So that it seemed the air was afraid of him;
And a she-wolf, that with all hungerings
  Seemed to be laden in her meagreness,
  And many folk has caused to live forlorn!
She brought upon me so much heaviness,
  With the affright that from her aspect came,
  That I the hope relinquished of the height.
And as he is who willingly acquires,
  And the time comes that causes him to lose,
  Who weeps in all his thoughts and is despondent,
E'en such made me that beast withouten peace,
  Which, coming on against me by degrees
  Thrust me back thither where the sun is silent.
While I was rushing downward to the lowland,
  Before mine eyes did one present himself,
  Who seemed from long-continued silence hoarse.
When I beheld him in the desert vast,
  “Have pity on me,” unto him I cried,
  “Whiche’er thou art, or shade or real man!”
He answered me: “Not man; man once I was,
  And both my parents were of Lombardy,
  And Mantuans by country both of them.
‘Sub Julio’ was I born, though it was late,
  And lived at Rome under the good Augustus,
  During the time of false and lying gods.
A poet was I, and I sang that just
  Son of Anchises, who came forth from Troy,
  After that Ilion the superb was burned.
But thou, why goest thou back to such annoyance?
  Why climb’st thou not the Mount Delectable,
  Which is the source and cause of every joy?”
“Now, art thou that Virgilius and that fountain
  Which spreads abroad so wide a river of speech?”
  I made response to him with bashful forehead.
“O, of the other poets honour and light,
  Avail me the long study and great love
  That have impelled me to explore thy volume!
Thou art my master, and my author thou,
  Thou art alone the one from whom I took
  The beautiful style that has done honour to me.
Behold the beast, for which I have turned back;
  Do thou protect me from her, famous Sage,
  For she doth make my veins and pulses tremble.”
“Thee it behoves to take another road,”
  Responded he, when he beheld me weeping,
  “If from this savage place thou wouldst escape;
Because this beast, at which thou criest out,
  Suffers not any one to pass her way,
  But so doth harass him, that she destroys him;
And has a nature so malign and ruthless,
  That never doth she glut her greedy will,
  And after food is hungrier than before.
Many the animals with whom she weds,
  And more they shall be still, until the Greyhound
  Comes, who shall make her perish in her pain.
He shall not feed on either earth or pelf,
  But upon wisdom, and on love and virtue;
  'Twixt Feltro and Feltro shall his nation be;
Of that low Italy shall he be the saviour,
  On whose account the maid Camilla died,
  Euryalus, Turnus, Nisus, of their wounds;
Through every city shall he hunt her down,
  Until he shall have driven her back to Hell,
  There from whence envy first did let her loose.
Therefore I think and judge it for thy best
  Thou follow me, and I will be thy guide,
  And lead thee hence through the eternal place,
Where thou shalt hear the desperate lamentations,
  Shalt see the ancient spirits disconsolate,
  Who cry out each one for the second death;
And thou shalt see those who contented are
  Within the fire, because they hope to come,
  Whene’er it may be, to the blessed people;
To whom, then, if thou wishest to ascend,
  A soul shall be for that than I more worthy;
  With her at my departure I will leave thee;
Because that Emperor, who reigns above,
  In that I was rebellious to his law,
  Wills that through me none come into his city.
He governs everywhere, and there he reigns;
  There is his city and his lofty throne;
  O happy he whom thereto he elects!”
And I to him: “Poet, I thee entreat,
  By that same God whom thou didst never know,
  So that I may escape this woe and worse,
Thou wouldst conduct me there where thou hast said,
  That I may see the portal of Saint Peter,
  And those thou makest so disconsolate.”
Then he moved on, and I behind him followed."
Paul Revere’s Ride,"Listen, my children, and you shall hear
Of the midnight ride of Paul Revere,
On the eighteenth of April, in Seventy-Five:
Hardly a man is now alive
Who remembers that famous day and year.
He said to his friend, “If the British march
By land or sea from the town to-night,
Hang a lantern aloft in the belfry-arch
Of the North-Church-tower, as a signal-light,—
One if by land, and two if by sea;
And I on the opposite shore will be,
Ready to ride and spread the alarm
Through every Middlesex village and farm,
For the country-folk to be up and to arm.”
Then he said “Good night!” and with muffled oar
Silently rowed to the Charlestown shore,
Just as the moon rose over the bay,
Where swinging wide at her moorings lay
The Somerset, British man-of-war:
A phantom ship, with each mast and spar
Across the moon, like a prison-bar,
And a huge black hulk, that was magnified
By its own reflection in the tide.
Meanwhile, his friend, through alley and street
Wanders and watches with eager ears,
Till in the silence around him he hears
The muster of men at the barrack door,
The sound of arms, and the tramp of feet,
And the measured tread of the grenadiers
Marching down to their boats on the shore.
Then he climbed to the tower of the church,
Up the wooden stairs, with stealthy tread,
To the belfry-chamber overhead,
And startled the pigeons from their perch
On the sombre rafters, that round him made
Masses and moving shapes of shade,—
By the trembling ladder, steep and tall,
To the highest window in the wall,
Where he paused to listen and look down
A moment on the roofs of the town,
And the moonlight flowing over all.
Beneath, in the churchyard, lay the dead,
In their night-encampment on the hill,
Wrapped in silence so deep and still
That he could hear, like a sentinel’s tread,
The watchful night-wind, as it went
Creeping along from tent to tent,
And seeming to whisper, “All is well!”
A moment only he feels the spell
Of the place and the hour, and the secret dread
Of the lonely belfry and the dead;
For suddenly all his thoughts are bent
On a shadowy something far away,
Where the river widens to meet the bay,—
A line of black, that bends and floats
On the rising tide, like a bridge of boats.
Meanwhile, impatient to mount and ride,
Booted and spurred, with a heavy stride,
On the opposite shore walked Paul Revere.
Now he patted his horse’s side,
Now gazed on the landscape far and near,
Then impetuous stamped the earth,
And turned and tightened his saddle-girth;
But mostly he watched with eager search
The belfry-tower of the old North Church,
As it rose above the graves on the hill,
Lonely and spectral and sombre and still.
And lo! as he looks, on the belfry’s height,
A glimmer, and then a gleam of light!
He springs to the saddle, the bridle he turns,
But lingers and gazes, till full on his sight
A second lamp in the belfry burns!
A hurry of hoofs in a village-street,
A shape in the moonlight, a bulk in the dark,
And beneath from the pebbles, in passing, a spark
Struck out by a steed that flies fearless and fleet:
That was all! And yet, through the gloom and the light,
The fate of a nation was riding that night;
And the spark struck out by that steed, in his flight,
Kindled the land into flame with its heat.
He has left the village and mounted the steep,
And beneath him, tranquil and broad and deep,
Is the Mystic, meeting the ocean tides;
And under the alders, that skirt its edge,
Now soft on the sand, now loud on the ledge,
Is heard the tramp of his steed as he rides.
It was twelve by the village clock
When he crossed the bridge into Medford town.
He heard the crowing of the cock,
And the barking of the farmer’s dog,
And felt the damp of the river-fog,
That rises when the sun goes down.
It was one by the village clock,
When he galloped into Lexington.
He saw the gilded weathercock
Swim in the moonlight as he passed,
And the meeting-house windows, blank and bare,
Gaze at him with a spectral glare,
As if they already stood aghast
At the bloody work they would look upon.
It was two by the village clock,
When he came to the bridge in Concord town.
He heard the bleating of the flock,
And the twitter of birds among the trees,
And felt the breath of the morning breeze
Blowing over the meadows brown.
And one was safe and asleep in his bed
Who at the bridge would be first to fall,
Who that day would be lying dead,
Pierced by a British musket-ball.
You know the rest. In the books you have read,
How the British Regulars fired and fled,—
How the farmers gave them ball for ball,
From behind each fence and farmyard-wall,
Chasing the red-coats down the lane,
Then crossing the fields to emerge again
Under the trees at the turn of the road,
And only pausing to fire and load.
So through the night rode Paul Revere;
And so through the night went his cry of alarm
To every Middlesex village and farm,—
A cry of defiance, and not of fear,
A voice in the darkness, a knock at the door,
And a word that shall echo forevermore!
For, borne on the night-wind of the Past,
Through all our history, to the last,
In the hour of darkness and peril and need,
The people will waken and listen to hear
The hurrying hoof-beats of that steed,
And the midnight message of Paul Revere."
The Tyger,"Tyger! Tyger! burning bright
In the forests of the night,
What immortal hand or eye
Could frame thy fearful symmetry?
In what distant deeps or skies
Burnt the fire of thine eyes?
On what wings dare he aspire?
What the hand, dare sieze the fire?
And what shoulder, & what art,
Could twist the sinews of thy heart?
And when thy heart began to beat,
What dread hand? & what dread feet?
What the hammer? what the chain?
In what furnace was thy brain?
What the anvil? what dread grasp
Dare its deadly terrors clasp?
When the stars threw down their spears,
And water'd heaven with their tears,
Did he smile his work to see?
Did he who made the Lamb make thee?
Tyger! Tyger! burning bright
In the forests of the night,
What immortal hand or eye
Dare frame thy fearful symmetry?"
Annabel Lee,"It was many and many a year ago,
   In a kingdom by the sea,
That a maiden there lived whom you may know
   By the name of Annabel Lee;
And this maiden she lived with no other thought
   Than to love and be loved by me.
I was a child and she was a child,
   In this kingdom by the sea:
But we loved with a love that was more than love—
   I and my Annabel Lee;
With a love that the winged seraphs of heaven
   Coveted her and me.
And this was the reason that, long ago,
   In this kingdom by the sea,
A wind blew out of a cloud, chilling
   My beautiful Annabel Lee;
So that her highborn kinsman came
   And bore her away from me,
To shut her up in a sepulchre
   In this kingdom by the sea.
The angels, not half so happy in heaven,
   Went envying her and me—
Yes!—that was the reason (as all men know,
   In this kingdom by the sea)
That the wind came out of the cloud by night,
   Chilling and killing my Annabel Lee.
But our love it was stronger by far than the love
   Of those who were older than we—
   Of many far wiser than we—
And neither the angels in heaven above,
   Nor the demons down under the sea,
Can ever dissever my soul from the soul
   Of the beautiful Annabel Lee:
For the moon never beams, without bringing me dreams
   Of the beautiful Annabel Lee;
And the stars never rise, but I feel the bright eyes
   Of the beautiful Annabel Lee;
And so, all the night-tide, I lie down by the side
Of my darling—my darling—my life and my bride,
   In her sepulchre there by the sea,
   In her tomb by the sounding sea."
When Giving Is All We Have,"                                              One river gives
                                              Its journey to the next.
We give because someone gave to us.
We give because nobody gave to us.
We give because giving has changed us.
We give because giving could have changed us.
We have been better for it,
We have been wounded by it—
Giving has many faces: It is loud and quiet,
Big, though small, diamond in wood-nails.
Its story is old, the plot worn and the pages too,
But we read this book, anyway, over and again:
Giving is, first and every time, hand to hand,
Mine to yours, yours to mine.
You gave me blue and I gave you yellow.
Together we are simple green. You gave me
What you did not have, and I gave you
What I had to give—together, we made
Something greater from the difference.

The Red Wheelbarrow,"so much depends

The Red Poppy,"The great thing
is not having
a mind. Feelings:
oh, I have those; they
govern me. I have
a lord in heaven
called the sun, and open
for him, showing him
the fire of my own heart, fire
like his presence.
What could such glory be
if not a heart? Oh my brothers and sisters,
were you like me once, long ago,
before you were human? Did you
permit yourselves
to open once, who would never
open again? Because in truth
I am speaking now
the way you do. I speak
because I am shattered."

A gash, a rash and purple bumps.

And there's one more—that's seventeen,
And don't you think my face looks green?
My leg is cut—my eyes are blue—
It might be instamatic flu.
I cough and sneeze and gasp and choke,
I'm sure that my left leg is broke—
My hip hurts when I move my chin,
My belly button's caving in,
My back is wrenched, my ankle's sprained,
My 'pendix pains each time it rains.
My nose is cold, my toes are numb.
I have a sliver in my thumb.
My neck is stiff, my voice is weak,
I hardly whisper when I speak.
My tongue is filling up my mouth,
I think my hair is falling out.
My elbow's bent, my spine ain't straight,
My temperature is one-o-eight.
My brain is shrunk, I cannot hear,
There is a hole inside my ear.
I have a hangnail, and my heart is—what?
What's that? What's that you say?
You say today is. . .Saturday?

Manifesto of the Lyric Selfie,"Our “I”s.

We peer and cross.
Go lazy.
We’re all girly.
We’re pretty selfie.
We write our poems.
We write our manifestos.
While sitting in the photo booth.
While skipping down the street.
We think: if only my camera
could see me now.
There is a tranquil lyric
but we recollect emotion
with the speed of the feed.
We pose to show
the spontaneous overflow
of powerful feelings.
There are no more countrysides.
There are no more churchyards.
We smudge our vistas.
We flip the cam around.

Hashtags of interiority

O Captain! My Captain!,"O Captain! my Captain! our fearful trip is done,
The ship has weather’d every rack, the prize we sought is won,
The port is near, the bells I hear, the people all exulting,
While follow eyes the steady keel, the vessel grim and daring;
       But O heart! heart! heart!
         O the bleeding drops of red,
           Where on the deck my Captain lies,
             Fallen cold and dead.
O Captain! my Captain! rise up and hear the bells;
Rise up- for you the flag is flung- for you the bugle trills,
For you bouquets and ribbon’d wreaths- for you the shores a-crowding,
For you they call, the swaying mass, their eager faces turning;
       Here Captain! dear father!
         This arm beneath your head!
           It is some dream that on the deck,
             You’ve fallen cold and dead.
My Captain does not answer, his lips are pale and still,
My father does not feel my arm, he has no pulse nor will,
The ship is anchor’d safe and sound, its voyage closed and done,
From fearful trip the victor ship comes in with object won;

"Julius Caesar, Act III, Scene I [O, pardon me, thou bleeding piece of earth]","Antony speaks over Caesar's body

O, pardon me, thou bleeding piece of earth,
That I am meek and gentle with these butchers!
Thou art the ruins of the noblest man
That ever lived in the tide of times.
Woe to the hand that shed this costly blood!
Over thy wounds now do I prophesy,—
Which, like dumb mouths, do ope their ruby lips,
To beg the voice and utterance of my tongue—
A curse shall light upon the limbs of men;
Domestic fury and fierce civil strife
Shall cumber all the parts of Italy;
Blood and destruction shall be so in use
And dreadful objects so familiar
That mothers shall but smile when they behold
Their infants quarter'd with the hands of war;
All pity choked with custom of fell deeds:
And Caesar's spirit, ranging for revenge,
With Ate by his side come hot from hell,
Shall in these confines with a monarch's voice
Cry 'Havoc,' and let slip the dogs of war;
That this foul deed shall smell above the earth
With carrion men, groaning for burial."

I. The Burial of the Dead
April is the cruellest month, breeding
Lilacs out of the dead land, mixing
Memory and desire, stirring
Dull roots with spring rain.
Winter kept us warm, covering
Earth in forgetful snow, feeding
A little life with dried tubers.
Summer surprised us, coming over the Starnbergersee
With a shower of rain; we stopped in the colonnade,
And went on in sunlight, into the Hofgarten,
And drank coffee, and talked for an hour.
Bin gar keine Russin, stamm’ aus Litauen, echt deutsch.
And when we were children, staying at the archduke’s,
My cousin’s, he took me out on a sled,
And I was frightened. He said, Marie,
Marie, hold on tight. And down we went.
In the mountains, there you feel free.
I read, much of the night, and go south in the winter.
What are the roots that clutch, what branches grow
Out of this stony rubbish? Son of man,
You cannot say, or guess, for you know only
A heap of broken images, where the sun beats,
And the dead tree gives no shelter, the cricket no relief,
And the dry stone no sound of water. Only
There is shadow under this red rock,
(Come in under the shadow of this red rock),
And I will show you something different from either
Your shadow at morning striding behind you
Or your shadow at evening rising to meet you;
I will show you fear in a handful of dust.

“You gave me hyacinths first a year ago;
“They called me the hyacinth girl.”
—Yet when we came back, late, from the Hyacinth garden,
Your arms full, and your hair wet, I could not
Speak, and my eyes failed, I was neither
Living nor dead, and I knew nothing,
Looking into the heart of light, the silence.
Öd’ und leer das Meer.
Madame Sosostris, famous clairvoyante,
Had a bad cold, nevertheless
Is known to be the wisest woman in Europe,
With a wicked pack of cards. Here, said she,
Is your card, the drowned Phoenician Sailor,
(Those are pearls that were his eyes. Look!)
Here is Belladonna, the Lady of the Rocks,
The lady of situations.
Here is the man with three staves, and here the Wheel,
And here is the one-eyed merchant, and this card,
Which is blank, is something he carries on his back,
Which I am forbidden to see. I do not find
The Hanged Man. Fear death by water.
I see crowds of people, walking round in a ring.
Thank you. If you see dear Mrs. Equitone,
Tell her I bring the horoscope myself:
One must be so careful these days.
Unreal City,
Under the brown fog of a winter dawn,
A crowd flowed over London Bridge, so many,
I had not thought death had undone so many.
Sighs, short and infrequent, were exhaled,
And each man fixed his eyes before his feet.
Flowed up the hill and down King William Street,
To where Saint Mary Woolnoth kept the hours
With a dead sound on the final stroke of nine.
There I saw one I knew, and stopped him, crying: “Stetson!
“You who were with me in the ships at Mylae!
“That corpse you planted last year in your garden,
“Has it begun to sprout? Will it bloom this year?
“Or has the sudden frost disturbed its bed?
“Oh keep the Dog far hence, that’s friend to men,
“Or with his nails he’ll dig it up again!

  II. A Game of Chess
The Chair she sat in, like a burnished thone,
Glowed on the marble, where the glass
Held up by standards wrought with fruited vines
From which a golden Cupidon peeped out
(Another hid his eyes behind his wing)
Doubled the flames of sevenbranched candelabra
Reflecting light upon the table as
The glitter of her jewels rose to meet it,
From satin cases poured in rich profusion;
In vials of ivory and coloured glass
Unstoppered, lurked her strange synthetic perfumes,
Unguent, powdered, or liquid—troubled, confused
And drowned the sense in odours; stirred by the air
That freshened from the window, these ascended
In fattening the prolonged candle-flames,
Flung their smoke into the laquearia,
Stirring the pattern on the coffered ceiling.
Huge sea-wood fed with copper
Burned green and orange, framed by the coloured stone,
In which sad light a carvèd dolphin swam.
Above the antique mantel was displayed.
As though a window gave upon the sylvan scene
The change of Philomel, by the barbarous king
So rudely forced; yet there the nightingale
Filled all the desert with inviolable voice
And still she cried, and still the world pursues,
“Jug Jug” to dirty ears.
And other withered stumps of time
Were told upon the walls; staring forms
Leaned out, leaning, hushing the room enclosed.
Footsteps shuffled on the stair.
Under the firelight, under the brush, her hair
Spread out in fiery points
Clawed into words, then would be savagely still.
“My nerves are bad tonight. Yes, bad. Stay with me.
“Speak to me. Why do you never speak. Speak.
“What are you thinking of? What thinking? What?
“I never know what you are thinking. Think.”
I think we are in rats’ alley
Where the dead men lost their bones.
“What is the noise?”
                                 The wind under the door.
“What is that noise now? What is the wind doing?”
                                        Nothing again nothing.
                                                              “Do
“You know nothing? Do you see nothing? Do you remember
“Nothing?”
                    I remember

“Are you alive, or not? Is there nothing in your head?”
                                                            But
O  O  O  O  that Shakespeherian Rag—
It’s so elegant
So intelligent
“What shall I do now? What shall I do?”
“I shall rush out as I am, and walk the street
“With my hair down, so. What shall we do tomorrow?
“What shall we ever do?”
                                    The hot water at ten.
And if it rains, a closed car at four.
And we shall play a game of chess,
Pressing lidless eyes and waiting for a knock upon the door.
When Lil’s husband got demobbed, I said—
I didn’t mince my words, I said to her myself,
HURRY UP PLEASE ITS TIME
Now Albert’s coming back, make yourself a bit smart.
He’ll want to know what you done with that money he gave you
To get yourself some teeth. He did, I was there.
You have them all out, Lil, and get a nice set,
He said, I swear, I can’t bear to look at you.
And no more can’t I, I said, and think of poor Albert,
He’s been in the army four years, he wants a good time,
And if you don’t give it him, there's others will, I said.
Oh is there, she said. Something o’ that, I said.
Then I’ll know who to thank, she said, and give me a straight look.
HURRY UP PLEASE ITS TIME
If you don’t like it you can get on with it, I said,
Others can pick and choose if you can’t.
But if Albert makes off, it won’t be for lack of telling.
You ought to be ashamed, I said, to look so antique.
(And her only thirty-one.)
I can’t help it, she said, pulling a long face,
It’s them pills I took, to bring it off, she said.
(She’s had five already, and nearly died of young George.)
The chemist said it would be alright, but I’ve never been the same.
You are a proper fool, I said.
Well, if Albert won’t leave you alone, there it is, I said,
What you get married for if you don’t want children?
HURRY UP PLEASE ITS TIME
Well, that Sunday Albert was home, they had a hot gammon,
And they asked me in to dinner, to get the beauty of it hot—
HURRY UP PLEASE ITS TIME
HURRY UP PLEASE ITS TIME
Goonight Bill. Goonight Lou. Goonight May. Goonight.
Ta ta. Goonight. Goonight.
Good night, ladies, good night, sweet ladies, good night, good night.
  III. The Fire Sermon
The river’s tent is broken: the last fingers of leaf
Clutch and sink into the wet bank. The wind
Crosses the brown land, unheard. The nymphs are departed.
Sweet Thames, run softly, till I end my song.
The river bears no empty bottles, sandwich papers,
Silk handkerchiefs, cardboard boxes, cigarette ends
Or other testimony of summer nights. The nymphs are departed.
And their friends, the loitering heirs of City directors;
Departed, have left no addresses.
By the waters of Leman I sat down and wept . . .
Sweet Thames, run softly till I end my song,
Sweet Thames, run softly, for I speak not loud or long.
But at my back in a cold blast I hear
The rattle of the bones, and chuckle spread from ear to ear.
A rat crept softly through the vegetation
Dragging its slimy belly on the bank
While I was fishing in the dull canal
On a winter evening round behind the gashouse
Musing upon the king my brother’s wreck
And on the king my father’s death before him.
White bodies naked on the low damp ground
And bones cast in a little low dry garret,
Rattled by the rat’s foot only, year to year.
But at my back from time to time I hear
The sound of horns and motors, which shall bring
Sweeney to Mrs. Porter in the spring.
O the moon shone bright on Mrs. Porter
And on her daughter
They wash their feet in soda water
Et O ces voix d’enfants, chantant dans la coupole!
Twit twit twit
Jug jug jug jug jug jug
So rudely forc’d.
Tereu
Unreal City
Under the brown fog of a winter noon
Mr. Eugenides, the Smyrna merchant
Unshaven, with a pocket full of currants
C.i.f. London: documents at sight,
Asked me in demotic French
To luncheon at the Cannon Street Hotel
Followed by a weekend at the Metropole.
At the violet hour, when the eyes and back
Turn upward from the desk, when the human engine waits
Like a taxi throbbing waiting,
I Tiresias, though blind, throbbing between two lives,
Old man with wrinkled female breasts, can see
At the violet hour, the evening hour that strives
Homeward, and brings the sailor home from sea,
The typist home at teatime, clears her breakfast, lights
Her stove, and lays out food in tins.
Out of the window perilously spread
Her drying combinations touched by the sun’s last rays,
On the divan are piled (at night her bed)
Stockings, slippers, camisoles, and stays.
I Tiresias, old man with wrinkled dugs
Perceived the scene, and foretold the rest—
I too awaited the expected guest.
He, the young man carbuncular, arrives,
A small house agent’s clerk, with one bold stare,
One of the low on whom assurance sits
As a silk hat on a Bradford millionaire,
The time is now propitious, as he guesses,
The meal is ended, she is bored and tired,
Endeavours to engage her in caresses
Which still are unreproved, if undesired.
Flushed and decided, he assaults at once;
Exploring hands encounter no defence;
His vanity requires no response,
And makes a welcome of indifference.
(And I Tiresias have foresuffered all
Enacted on this same divan or bed;
I who have sat by Thebes below the wall
And walked among the lowest of the dead.)
Bestows one final patronising kiss,
And gropes his way, finding the stairs unlit . . .
She turns and looks a moment in the glass,
Hardly aware of her departed lover;
Her brain allows one half-formed thought to pass:
“Well now that’s done: and I’m glad it’s over.”
When lovely woman stoops to folly and
Paces about her room again, alone,
She smoothes her hair with automatic hand,
And puts a record on the gramophone.
“This music crept by me upon the waters”
And along the Strand, up Queen Victoria Street.
O City City, I can sometimes hear
Beside a public bar in Lower Thames Street,
The pleasant whining of a mandoline
And a clatter and a chatter from within
Where fishmen lounge at noon: where the walls
Of Magnus Martyr hold
Inexplicable splendour of Ionian white and gold.
The river sweats
Oil and tar
The barges drift
With the turning tide
Red sails
Wide
To leeward, swing on the heavy spar.
The barges wash
Drifting logs
Down Greenwich reach
Past the Isle of Dogs.
                       Weialala leia
                       Wallala leialala
Elizabeth and Leicester
Beating oars
The stern was formed
A gilded shell
Red and gold
The brisk swell
Rippled both shores
Southwest wind
Carried down stream
The peal of bells
White towers

                       Wallala leialala
“Trams and dusty trees.
Highbury bore me. Richmond and Kew
Undid me. By Richmond I raised my knees
Supine on the floor of a narrow canoe.”
“My feet are at Moorgate, and my heart
Under my feet. After the event
He wept. He promised ‘a new start.’
I made no comment. What should I resent?”
“On Margate Sands.
I can connect
Nothing with nothing.
The broken fingernails of dirty hands.
My people humble people who expect
Nothing.”
                       la la
To Carthage then I came
Burning burning burning burning
O Lord Thou pluckest me out
O Lord Thou pluckest
burning
  IV. Death by Water
Phlebas the Phoenician, a fortnight dead,
Forgot the cry of gulls, and the deep sea swell
And the profit and loss.
                                       A current under sea
Picked his bones in whispers. As he rose and fell
He passed the stages of his age and youth
Entering the whirlpool.
                                       Gentile or Jew
O you who turn the wheel and look to windward,
Consider Phlebas, who was once handsome and tall as you.
  V. What the Thunder Said
After the torchlight red on sweaty faces
After the frosty silence in the gardens
After the agony in stony places
The shouting and the crying
Prison and palace and reverberation
Of thunder of spring over distant mountains
He who was living is now dead
We who were living are now dying
With a little patience
Here is no water but only rock
Rock and no water and the sandy road
The road winding above among the mountains
Which are mountains of rock without water
If there were water we should stop and drink
Amongst the rock one cannot stop or think
Sweat is dry and feet are in the sand
If there were only water amongst the rock
Dead mountain mouth of carious teeth that cannot spit
Here one can neither stand nor lie nor sit
There is not even silence in the mountains
But dry sterile thunder without rain
There is not even solitude in the mountains
But red sullen faces sneer and snarl
From doors of mudcracked houses
                                              If there were water
      And no rock
      If there were rock
      And also water
      And water
      A spring
      A pool among the rock
      If there were the sound of water only
      Not the cicada
      And dry grass singing
      But sound of water over a rock
      Where the hermit-thrush sings in the pine trees
      Drip drop drip drop drop drop drop
      But there is no water
Who is the third who walks always beside you?
When I count, there are only you and I together
But when I look ahead up the white road
There is always another one walking beside you
Gliding wrapt in a brown mantle, hooded
I do not know whether a man or a woman
—But who is that one on the other side of you?
What is that sound high in the air
Murmur of maternal lamentation
Who are those hooded hordes swarming
Over endless plains, stumbling in cracked earth
Ringed by the flat horizon only
What is the city over the mountains
Cracks and reforms and bursts in the violet air
Falling towers
Jerusalem Athens Alexandria
Vienna London
Unreal
A woman drew her long black hair out tight
And fiddled whisper music on those strings
And bats with baby faces in the violet light
Whistled, and beat their wings
And crawled head downward down a blackened wall
And upside down in air were towers
Tolling reminiscent bells, that kept the hours
And voices singing out of empty cisterns and exhausted wells.
In this decayed hole among the mountains
In the faint moonlight, the grass is singing
Over the tumbled graves, about the chapel
There is the empty chapel, only the wind’s home,
It has no windows, and the door swings,
Dry bones can harm no one.
Only a cock stood on the rooftree
Co co rico co co rico
In a flash of lightning. Then a damp gust
Bringing rain
Ganga was sunken, and the limp leaves
Waited for rain, while the black clouds
Gathered far distant, over Himavant.
The jungle crouched, humped in silence.
Then spoke the thunder
DA
Datta: what have we given?
My friend, blood shaking my heart
The awful daring of a moment’s surrender
Which an age of prudence can never retract
By this, and this only, we have existed
Which is not to be found in our obituaries
Or in memories draped by the beneficent spider
Or under seals broken by the lean solicitor
In our empty rooms
DA
Dayadhvam: I have heard the key
Turn in the door once and turn once only
We think of the key, each in his prison
Thinking of the key, each confirms a prison
Only at nightfall, aethereal rumours
Revive for a moment a broken Coriolanus
DA
Damyata: The boat responded
Gaily, to the hand expert with sail and oar
The sea was calm, your heart would have responded
Gaily, when invited, beating obedient
To controlling hands
                                    I sat upon the shore
Fishing, with the arid plain behind me
Shall I at least set my lands in order?
London Bridge is falling down falling down falling down
Poi s’ascose nel foco che gli affina
em>Quando fiam ceu chelidon—O swallow swallow
Le Prince d’Aquitaine à la tour abolie
These fragments I have shored against my ruins
Why then Ile fit you. Hieronymo’s mad againe.
Datta. Dayadhvam. Damyata.

  Notes
Not only the title, but the plan and a good deal of the incidental symbolism of the poem were suggested by Miss Jessie L. Weston’s book on the Grail legend: From Ritual to Romance (Cambridge). Indeed, so deeply am I indebted, Miss Weston’s book will elucidate the difficulties of the poem much better than my notes can do; and I recommend it (apart from the great interest of the book itself) to any who think such elucidation of the poem worth the trouble. To another work of anthropology I am indebted in general, one which has influenced our generation profoundly; I mean The Golden Bough; I have used especially the two volumes Adonis, Attis, Osiris. Anyone who is acquainted with these works will immediately recognize in the poem certain references to vegetation ceremonies.
  I. The Burial of the Dead
Line 20. Cf. Ezekiel II, i.
23. Cf. Ecclesiastes XII, v.
31. V. Tristan und Isolde, I, verses 5–8.
42. Id. III, verse 24.
46. I am not familiar with the exact constitution of the Tarot pack of cards, from which I have obviously departed to suit my own convenience. The Hanged Man, a member of the traditional pack, fits my purpose in two ways: because he is associated in my mind with the Hanged God of Frazer, and because I associate him with the hooded figure in the passage of the disciples of Emmaus in Part V. The Phoenician Sailor and the Merchant appear later; also the “crowds of people,” and Death by Water is executed in Part IV. The Man with Three Staves (an authentic member of the Tarot pack) I associate, quite arbitrarily, with the Fisher King himself.
60. Cf. Baudelaire:
“Fourmillante cité, cité pleine de rêves
“Où le spectre en plein jour raccroche le passant.”
63. Cf. Inferno III, 55–57:
                          “si lunga tratta
“di gente, ch’io non avrei mai creduto
che morte tanta n’avesse disfatta.”
64. Cf. Inferno IV, 25–27:
“Quivi, secondo che per ascoltare,
“non avea pianto ma’ che de sospiri,
“che l’aura eterna facevan tremare.”

199. I do not know the origin of the ballad from which these lines are taken; it was reported to me from Sydney, Australia.
202. V. Verlaine, “Parsifal.”
210. The currants were quoted at a price “carriage and insurance free to London”; and the Bill of Lading etc. were to be handed to the buyer upon payment of the sight draft.
218. Tiresias, although a mere spectator and not indeed a “character,” is yet the most important personage in the poem, uniting all the rest. Just as the one-eyed merchant, seller of currants, melts into the Phoenician Sailor, and the latter is not wholly distinct from Ferdinand Prince of Naples, so all the women are one woman, and the two sexes meet in Tiresias. What Tiresias sees, in fact, is the substance of the poem. The whole passage from Ovid is of great anthropological interest:
. . . Cum Iunone iocos et “maior vestra profecto est
Quam, quae contingit maribus,” dixisse, “voluptas.”
Illa negat; placuit quae sit sententia docti
Quaerere Tiresiae: venus huic erat utraque nota.
Nam duo magnorum viridi coeuntia silva
Corpora serpentum baculi violaverat ictu
Deque viro factus, mirabile, femina septem
Egerat autumnos; octavo rursus eosdem
Vidit et “est vestrae si tanta potentia plagae,”
Dixit “ut auctoris sortem in contraria mutet,
Nunc quoque vos feriam!” percussis anguibus isdem
Forma prior rediit genetivaque venit imago.
Arbiter hic igitur sumptus de lite iocosa
Dicta Iovis firmat; gravius Saturnia iusto
Nec pro materia fertur doluisse suique
Iudicis aeterna damnavit lumina nocte,
At pater omnipotens (neque enim licet inrita cuiquam
Facta dei fecisse deo) pro lumine adempto
Scire future dedit poenamque levavit honore.
221. This may not appear as exact as Sappho’s lines, but I had in mind the “longshore” or “dory” fisherman, who returns at nightfall.
253. V. Goldsmith, the song in The Vicar of Wakefield.
257. V. The Tempest, as above.
264. The interior of St. Magnus Martyr is to my mind one of the finest among Wren’s interiors. See The Proposed Demolition of Nineteen City Churches: (P.S. King & Son Ltd.).
266. The Song of the (three) Thames-daughters begins here. From line 292 to 306 inclusive they speak in turn. V. Götterdämmerung, III, i: the Rhine-daughters.
279. V. Froude, Elizabeth Vol. I, ch. iv, letter of De Quadra to Philip of Spain: “In the afternoon we were in a barge, watching the games on the river. (The queen) was alone with Lord Robert and myself on the poop, when they began to talk nonsense, and went so far that Lord Robert at last said, as I was on the spot there was no reason why they should not be married if the queen pleased.”
293. Cf. Purgatorio, V. 133:
“Ricorditi di me, che son la Pia;
“Siena mi fe’, disfecemi Maremma.”
307. V. St. Augustine’s Confessions: “to Carthage then I came, where a cauldron of unholy loves sang all about mine ears.”
308. The complete text of the Buddha’s Fire Sermon (which corresponds in importance to the Sermon on the Mount) from which these words are taken, will be found translated in the late Henry Clarke Warren’s Buddhism in Translation (Harvard Oriental Series). Mr. Warren was one of the great pioneers of Buddhist studies in the occident.
312. From St. Augustine’s Confessions again. The collocation of these two representatives of eastern and western asceticism, as the culmination of this part of the poem, is not an accident.
  V. What the Thunder Said
In the first part of Part V three themes are employed: the journey to Emmaus, the approach to the Chapel Perilous (see Miss Weston’s book) and the present decay of eastern Europe.
357. This is Turdus aonalaschkae pallasii, the hermit-thrush which I have heard in Quebec Country. Chapman says (Handbook of Birds of Eastern North America) “it is most at home in secluded woodland and thickety retreats. . . . Its notes are not remarkable for variety or volume, but in purity and sweetness of tone and exquisite modulation they are unequaled.” Its “water-dripping song” is justly celebrated.
360. The following lines were stimulated by the account of one of the Antarctic expeditions (I forget which, but I think one of Shackleton’s): it was related that the party of explorers, at the extremity of their strength, had the constant delusion that there was one more member than could actually be counted.
366-76. Cf. Hermann Hesse, Blick ins Chaos: “Schon ist halb Europa, schon ist zumindest der halbe Osten Europas auf dem Wege zum Chaos, fährt betrunken im heiligem Wahn am Abgrund entlang und singt dazu, singt betrunken und hymnisch wie Dmitri Karamasoff sang. Ueber diese Lieder lacht der Bürger beleidigt, der Heilige und Seher hört sie mit Tränen.”
401. “Datta, dayadhvam, damyata” (Give, sympathise, control). The fable of the meaning of the Thunder is found in the Brihadaranyaka–Upanishad, 5, I. A translation is found in Deussen’s Sechzig Upanishads des Veda, p. 489.
407. Cf. Webster, The White Devil, V. vi:
                          “. . . they’ll remarry
“Ere the worm pierce your winding-sheet, ere the spider
Make a thin curtain for your epitaphs.”
411. Cf. Inferno, XXXIII, 46:
“ed io seniti chiavar l’uscio di sotto
all’orribile torre.”
Also F. H, Bradley, Appearance and Reality, p. 346.
“My external sensations are no less private to myself than are my thoughts or my feelings. In either case my experience falls within my own circle, a circle closed on the outside; and, with all its elements alike, every sphere is opaque to the others which surround it. . . . In brief, regarded as an existence which appears in a soul, the whole world for each is peculiar and private to that soul.”
424. V. Weston: From Ritual to Romance; chapter on the Fisher King.
427. V. Purgatorio, XXVI, 148.
“‘Ara vos prec, per aquella valor
‘que vos guida al som de l’escalina,
‘sovegna vos a temps de ma dolor.’
Poi s’ascose nel foco che gli affina.”
428. V. Pervigilium Veneris. Cf. Philomela in Parts II and III.
429. V. Gérard de Nerval, Sonnet “El Desdichado.”
431. V. Kyd’s Spanish Tragedy.
433. Shantih. Repeated as here, a formal ending to an Upanishad. “The Peace which passeth understanding” is a feeble transition of the content of this word."
The Kraken,"Below the thunders of the upper deep,
Far, far beneath in the abysmal sea,
His ancient, dreamless, uninvaded sleep
The Kraken sleepeth: faintest sunlights flee
About his shadowy sides; above him swell
Huge sponges of millennial growth and height;
And far away into the sickly light,
From many a wondrous grot and secret cell
Unnumbered and enormous polypi
Winnow with giant arms the slumbering green.
There hath he lain for ages, and will lie
Battening upon huge sea worms in his sleep,
Until the latter fire shall heat the deep;
Then once by man and angels to be seen,
In roaring he shall rise and on the surface die."
The Anactoria Poem,"Some say thronging cavalry, some say foot soldiers, 
others call a fleet the most beautiful of 
sights the dark earth offers, but I say it's what-
            ever you love best.

And it's easy to make this understood by 
everyone, for she who surpassed all human 
kind in beauty, Helen, abandoning her
            husband—that best of

men—went sailing off to the shores of Troy and 
never spent a thought on her child or loving 
parents: when the goddess seduced her wits and
            left her to wander,

she forgot them all, she could not remember 
anything but longing, and lightly straying 
aside, lost her way. But that reminds me
            now: Anactória,

she's not here, and I'd rather see her lovely 
step, her sparkling glance and her face than gaze on
all the troops in Lydia in their chariots and
            glittering armor."
Drummer Hodge,"I
They throw in Drummer Hodge, to rest
     Uncoffined—just as found:
His landmark is a kopje-crest
     That breaks the veldt around;
And foreign constellations west
     Each night above his mound.
 II
Young Hodge the Drummer never knew—
     Fresh from his Wessex home—
The meaning of the broad Karoo,
     The Bush, the dusty loam,
And why uprose to nightly view
     Strange stars amid the gloam.
 III
Yet portion of that unknown plain
     Will Hodge for ever be;
His homely Northern breast and brain
     Grow up a Southern tree,
And strange-eyed constellations reign
     His stars eternally."
Epitaph to a Dog,"Near this Spot
are deposited the Remains of one
who possessed Beauty without Vanity,
Strength without Insolence,
Courage without Ferosity,
and all the virtues of Man without his Vices.
This praise, which would be unmeaning Flattery
if inscribed over human Ashes,
is but a just tribute to the Memory of
BOATSWAIN, a DOG,
who was born in Newfoundland May 1803
and died at Newstead Nov. 18th, 1808.
When some proud Son of Man returns to Earth,
Unknown to Glory but upheld by Birth,
The sculptor's art exhausts the pomp of woe,
And storied urns record who rests below:
When all is done, upon the Tomb is seen
Not what he was, but what he should have been.
But the poor Dog, in life the firmest friend,
The first to welcome, foremost to defend,
Whose honest heart is still his Master's own,
Who labours, fights, lives, breathes for him alone,
Unhonour'd falls, unnotic'd all his worth,
Deny'd in heaven the Soul he held on earth:
While man, vain insect! hopes to be forgiven,
And claims himself a sole exclusive heaven.
Oh man! thou feeble tenant of an hour,
Debas'd by slavery, or corrupt by power,
Who knows thee well, must quit thee with disgust,
Degraded mass of animated dust!
Thy love is lust, thy friendship all a cheat,
Thy tongue hypocrisy, thy heart deceit!
By nature vile, ennobled but by name,
Each kindred brute might bid thee blush for shame.
Ye! who behold perchance this simple urn,
Pass on, it honors none you wish to mourn.
To mark a friend's remains these stones arise;
I never knew but one—and here he lies."
"The Aeneid, Book I, [Arms and the man I sing]","Arms and the man I sing, who, forced by fate
And haughty Juno's unrelenting hate,
Expelled and exiled, left the Trojan shore.
Long labors, both by sea and land, he bore;
And in the doubtful war, before he won
The Latin realm and built the destined town,
His banished gods restored to rights divine,
And settled sure succession in his line;
From whence the race of Alban fathers come,
And the long glories of majestic Rome.
     O Muse! the causes and the crimes relate,—
What goddess was provok'd, and whence her hate;
For what offense the Queen of Heav'n began
To persecute so brave, so just a man;
Involv'd his anxious life in endless cares,
Expos'd to wants, and hurried into wars!
Can heav'nly minds such high resentment show,
Or exercise their spite in human woe?
     Against the Tiber's mouth, but far away,
An ancient town was seated on the sea,—
A Tyrian colony; the people made
Stout for the war, and studious of their trade:
Carthage the name; belov'd by Juno more
Than her own Argos, or the Samian shore.
Here stood her chariot; here, if Heav'n were kind,
The seat of awful empire she design'd.
Yet she had heard an ancient rumor fly,
(Long cited by the people of the sky,)
That times to come should see the Trojan race
Her Carthage ruin, and her tow'rs deface;
Nor thus confin'd, the yoke of sov'reign sway
Should on the necks of all the nations lay.
She ponder'd this, and fear'd it was in fate;
Nor could forget the war she wag'd of late
For conqu'ring Greece against the Trojan state.
Besides, long causes working in her mind,
And secret seeds of envy, lay behind;
Deep graven in her heart the doom remain'd
Of partial Paris, and her form disdain'd;
The grace bestow'd on ravish'd Ganymed,
Electra's glories, and her injur'd bed.
Each was a cause alone; and all combin'd
To kindle vengeance in her haughty mind.
For this, far distant from the Latian coast
She drove the remnants of the Trojan host;
And sev'n long years th' unhappy wand'ring train
Were toss'd by storms, and scatter'd thro' the main.
Such time, such toil, requir'd the Roman name,
Such length of labor for so vast a frame.
     Now scarce the Trojan fleet with sails and oars
Had left behind the fair Sicilian shores,
Entering with cheerful shouts the watery reign,
And plowing frothy furrows in the main,
When, laboring still, with endless discontent
The Queen of Heaven did thus her fury vent:—
     ""Then am I vanquished? must I yield?"" said she,
""And must the Trojans reign in Italy?""
So Fate will have it, and Jove adds his force;
Nor can my power divert their happy course.
Could angry Pallas, with revengeful spleen,
The Grecian navy burn and drown the men?
She, for the fault of one offending foe,
The bolts of Jove himself presumed to throw;
With whirlwinds from beneath she tossed the ship
And bare exposed the bosom of the deep:
Then, as an eagle gripes the trembling game,
The wretch , yet hissing with her father's flame,
She strongly seized, and with a burning wound,
Transfixed and naked, on a rock she bound.
But I, who walked in awful state above,
The majesty of heaven, the sister-wife of Jove,
For length of years my fruitless force employ
Against the thin remains of ruined Troy.
What nations now to Juno's power will pray,
Or offerings on  my slighted altars lay?"""
Blues,"I am lazy, the laziest
girl in the world. I sleep during
the day when I want to, 'til
my face is creased and swollen,
'til my lips are dry and hot. I 
eat as I please: cookies and milk
after lunch, butter and sour cream
on my baked potato, foods that
slothful people eat, that turn
yellow and opaque beneath the skin.
Sometimes come dinnertime Sunday
I am still in my nightgown, the one
with the lace trim listing because
I have not mended it. Many days
I do not exercise, only
consider it, then rub my curdy
belly and lie down. Even
my poems are lazy. I use
syllabics instead of iambs,
prefer slant to the gong of full rhyme,
write briefly while others go
for pages. And yesterday,
for example, I did not work at all!
I got in my car and I drove 
to factory outlet stores, purchased
stockings and panties and socks
with my father's money.

To think, in childhood I missed only
one day of school per year. I went
to ballet class four days a week
at four-forty-five and on
Saturdays, beginning always
with plie, ending with curtsy.
To think, I knew only industry,
the industry of my race
and of immigrants, the radio
tuned always to the station
that said, Line up your summer
job months in advance. Work hard
and do not shame your family,
who worked hard to give you what you have.
There is no sin but sloth. Burn
to a wick and keep moving.

I avoided sleep for years,
up at night replaying 
evening news stories about
nearby jailbreaks, fat people
who ate fried chicken and woke up
dead. In sleep I am looking
for poems in the shape of open
V's of birds flying in formation,
or open arms saying, I forgive you, all."

  I saw the best minds of my generation destroyed by madness, starving hysterical naked,
dragging themselves through the negro streets at dawn looking for an angry fix,
angelheaded hipsters burning for the ancient heavenly connection to the starry dynamo in the machinery of night,
who poverty and tatters and hollow-eyed and high sat up smoking in the supernatural darkness of cold-water flats floating across the tops of cities contemplating jazz,
who bared their brains to Heaven under the El and saw Mohammedan angels staggering on tenement roofs illuminated,
who passed through universities with radiant cool eyes hallucinating Arkansas and Blake-light tragedy among the scholars of war,
who were expelled from the academies for crazy & publishing obscene odes on the windows of the skull,
who cowered in unshaven rooms in underwear, burning their money in wastebaskets and listening to the Terror through the wall,
who got busted in their pubic beards returning through Laredo with a belt of marijuana for New York,
who ate fire in paint hotels or drank turpentine in Paradise Alley, death, or purgatoried their torsos night after night
with dreams, with drugs, with waking nightmares, alcohol and cock and endless balls,
incomparable blind streets of shuddering cloud and lightning in the mind leaping toward poles of Canada & Paterson, illuminating all the motionless world of Time between,
Peyote solidities of halls, backyard green tree cemetery dawns, wine drunkenness over the rooftops, storefront boroughs of teahead joyride neon blinking traffic light, sun and moon and tree vibrations in the roaring winter dusks of Brooklyn, ashcan rantings and kind king light of mind,
who chained themselves to subways for the endless ride from Battery to holy Bronx on benzedrine until the noise of wheels and children brought them down shuddering mouth-wracked and battered bleak of brain all drained of brilliance in the drear light of Zoo,
who sank all night in submarine light of Bickford’s floated out and sat through the stale beer afternoon in desolate Fugazzi’s, listening to the crack of doom on the hydrogen jukebox,
who talked continuously seventy hours from park to pad to bar to Bellevue to museum to the Brooklyn Bridge,
a lost battalion of platonic conversationalists jumping down the stoops off fire escapes off windowsills off Empire State out of the moon,
yacketayakking screaming vomiting whispering facts and memories and anecdotes and eyeball kicks and shocks of hospitals and jails and wars,
whole intellects disgorged in total recall for seven days and nights with brilliant eyes, meat for the Synagogue cast on the pavement,

suffering Eastern sweats and Tangerian bone-grindings and migraines of China under junk-withdrawal in Newark’s bleak furnished room,

who retired to Mexico to cultivate a habit, or Rocky Mount to tender Buddha or Tangiers to boys or Southern Pacific to the black locomotive or Harvard to Narcissus to Woodlawn to the daisychain or grave,
who demanded sanity trials accusing the radio of hypnotism & were left with their insanity & their hands & a hung jury,
who threw potato salad at CCNY lecturers on Dadaism and subsequently presented themselves on the granite steps of the madhouse with shaven heads and harlequin speech of suicide, demanding instantaneous lobotomy,

who in humorless protest overturned only one symbolic pingpong table, resting briefly in catatonia,
returning years later truly bald except for a wig of blood, and tears and fingers, to the visible madman doom of the wards of the madtowns of the East,
Pilgrim State’s Rockland’s and Greystone’s foetid halls, bickering with the echoes of the soul, rocking and rolling in the midnight solitude-bench dolmen-realms of love, dream of life a nightmare, bodies turned to stone as heavy as the moon,
with mother finally ******, and the last fantastic book flung out of the tenement window, and the last door closed at 4 A.M. and the last telephone slammed at the wall in reply and the last furnished room emptied down to the last piece of mental furniture, a yellow paper rose twisted on a wire hanger in the closet, and even that imaginary, nothing but a hopeful little bit of hallucination—
ah, Carl, while you are not safe I am not safe, and now you’re really in the total animal soup of time—
and who therefore ran through the icy streets obsessed with a sudden flash of the alchemy of the use of the ellipsis catalogue a variable measure and the vibrating plane,
who dreamt and made incarnate gaps in Time & Space through images juxtaposed, and trapped the archangel of the soul between 2 visual images and joined the elemental verbs and set the noun and dash of consciousness together jumping with sensation of Pater Omnipotens Aeterna Deus
to recreate the syntax and measure of poor human prose and stand before you speechless and intelligent and shaking with shame, rejected yet confessing out the soul to conform to the rhythm of thought in his naked and endless head,
the madman bum and angel beat in Time, unknown, yet putting down here what might be left to say in time come after death,
and rose reincarnate in the ghostly clothes of jazz in the goldhorn shadow of the band and blew the suffering of America’s naked mind for love into an eli eli lamma lamma sabacthani saxophone cry that shivered the cities down to the last radio
with the absolute heart of the poem of life butchered out of their own bodies good to eat a thousand years.

The Naming of Cats,"The Naming of Cats is a difficult matter,
     It isn’t just one of your holiday games;
You may think at first I’m as mad as a hatter
When I tell you, a cat must have THREE DIFFERENT NAMES.
First of all, there’s the name that the family use daily,
     Such as Peter, Augustus, Alonzo, or James,
Such as Victor or Jonathan, George or Bill Bailey—
     All of them sensible everyday names.
There are fancier names if you think they sound sweeter,
     Some for the gentlemen, some for the dames:
Such as Plato, Admetus, Electra, Demeter—
     But all of them sensible everyday names,
But I tell you, a cat needs a name that’s particular,
     A name that’s peculiar, and more dignified,
Else how can he keep up his tail perpendicular,
     Or spread out his whiskers, or cherish his pride?
Of names of this kind, I can give you a quorum,
     Such as Munkustrap, Quaxo, or Coricopat,
Such as Bombalurina, or else Jellylorum—
     Names that never belong to more than one cat.
But above and beyond there’s still one name left over,
     And that is the name that you never will guess;
The name that no human research can discover—
     But THE CAT HIMSELF KNOWS, and will never confess.
When you notice a cat in profound meditation,
     The reason, I tell you, is always the same:
His mind is engaged in a rapt contemplation
     Of the thought, of the thought, of the thought of his name:
          His ineffable effable
          Effanineffable
Deep and inscrutable singular name."
Dreams,"Hold fast to dreams 
For if dreams die
Life is a broken-winged bird
That cannot fly.
Hold fast to dreams
For when dreams go
Life is a barren field
Frozen with snow."
Dead Stars,"Out here, there’s a bowing even the trees are doing.
                 Winter’s icy hand at the back of all of us.
Black bark, slick yellow leaves, a kind of stillness that feels
so mute it’s almost in another year.
I am a hearth of spiders these days: a nest of trying.
We point out the stars that make Orion as we take out
       the trash, the rolling containers a song of suburban thunder.
It’s almost romantic as we adjust the waxy blue
       recycling bin until you say, Man, we should really learn
some new constellations.
And it’s true. We keep forgetting about Antlia, Centaurus,
       Draco, Lacerta, Hydra, Lyra, Lynx.
But mostly we’re forgetting we’re dead stars too, my mouth is full
       of dust and I wish to reclaim the rising—
to lean in the spotlight of streetlight with you, toward
       what’s larger within us, toward how we were born.
Look, we are not unspectacular things.
       We’ve come this far, survived this much. What
would happen if we decided to survive more? To love harder?
What if we stood up with our synapses and flesh and said, No.
     No, to the rising tides.
Stood for the many mute mouths of the sea, of the land?
What would happen if we used our bodies to bargain
for the safety of others, for earth,
                 if we declared a clean night, if we stopped being terrified,
if we launched our demands into the sky, made ourselves so big
people could point to us with the arrows they make in their minds,
rolling their trash bins out, after all of this is over?"
The City in the Sea,"Lo! Death has reared himself a throne
In a strange city lying alone
Far down within the dim West,
Where the good and the bad and the worst and the best
Have gone to their eternal rest.
There shrines and palaces and towers
(Time-eaten towers and tremble not!)
Resemble nothing that is ours.
Around, by lifting winds forgot,
Resignedly beneath the sky
The melancholy waters lie.
No rays from the holy Heaven come down
On the long night-time of that town;
But light from out the lurid sea
Streams up the turrets silently—
Gleams up the pinnacles far and free—
Up domes—up spires—up kingly halls—
Up fanes—up Babylon-like walls—
Up shadowy long-forgotten bowers
Of sculptured ivy and stone flowers—
Up many and many a marvellous shrine
Whose wreathed friezes intertwine
The viol, the violet, and the vine.
Resignedly beneath the sky
The melancholy waters lie.
So blend the turrets and shadows there
That all seem pendulous in air,
While from a proud tower in the town
Death looks gigantically down.
There open fanes and gaping graves
Yawn level with the luminous waves;
But not the riches there that lie
In each idol’s diamond eye—
Not the gaily-jewelled dead
Tempt the waters from their bed;
For no ripples curl, alas!
Along that wilderness of glass—
No swellings tell that winds may be
Upon some far-off happier sea—
No heavings hint that winds have been
On seas less hideously serene.
But lo, a stir is in the air!
The wave—there is a movement there!
As if the towers had thrust aside,
In slightly sinking, the dull tide—
As if their tops had feebly given
A void within the filmy Heaven.
The waves have now a redder glow—
The hours are breathing faint and low—
And when, amid no earthly moans,
Down, down that town shall settle hence,
Hell, rising from a thousand thrones,
Shall do it reverence."
Eldorado,"         Gaily bedight,
         A gallant knight,
     In sunshine and in shadow,
         Had journeyed long,
         Singing a song,
     In search of Eldorado.

         But he grew old—
         This knight so bold—
     And o’er his heart a shadow
         Fell, as he found
         No spot of ground
     That looked like Eldorado.

         And, as his strength
         Failed him at length,
     He met a pilgrim shadow—
         ‘Shadow,’ said he,
         ‘Where can it be—
     This land of Eldorado?’ 

         ‘Over the Mountains
         Of the Moon,
     Down the Valley of the Shadow,
         Ride, boldly ride,’ 
         The shade replied,—
     ‘If you seek for Eldorado!’ "
Scaffolding,"Masons, when they start upon a building,
Are careful to test out the scaffolding;
Make sure that planks won’t slip at busy points,
Secure all ladders, tighten bolted joints.
And yet all this comes down when the job’s done
Showing off walls of sure and solid stone.
So if, my dear, there sometimes seem to be
Old bridges breaking between you and me
Never fear. We may let the scaffolds fall
Confident that we have built our wall."
"Song of Myself, V","I believe in you my soul, the other I am must not abase itself to you,
And you must not be abased to the other.
Loafe with me on the grass,  loose the stop from your throat,
Not words, not music or rhyme I want, not custom or lecture, not even the best,
Only the lull I like, the hum of your valvèd voice.
I mind how once we lay such a transparent summer morning, 
How you settled your head athwart my hips and gently turn'd over upon me,
And parted the shirt from my bosom-bone, and plunged your tongue to my bare-stript heart,
And reach'd till you felt my beard, and reach'd till you held my feet.
Swiftly arose and spread around me the peace and knowledge that pass all the argument of the earth,
And I know that the hand of God is the promise of my own,
And I know that the spirit of God is the brother of my own,
And that all the men ever born are also my brothers,  and the women my sisters and lovers,
And that a kelson of the creation is love,
And limitless are leaves stiff or drooping in the fields,
And brown ants in the little wells beneath them,
And mossy scabs of the worm fence, heap'd stones, elder, mullein and poke-weed."
A Poison Tree,"I was angry with my friend:
I told my wrath, my wrath did end.
I was angry with my foe:
I told it not, my wrath did grow.
And I watered it in fears
Night and morning with my tears,
And I sunned it with smiles
And with soft deceitful wiles.
And it grew both day and night,
Till it bore an apple bright,
And my foe beheld it shine,
And he knew that it was mine,--
And into my garden stole
When the night had veiled the pole;
In the morning, glad, I see
My foe outstretched beneath the tree."
In Memory of W. B. Yeats,"I
He disappeared in the dead of winter:
The brooks were frozen, the airports almost deserted,
And snow disfigured the public statues;
The mercury sank in the mouth of the dying day.
What instruments we have agree
The day of his death was a dark cold day.
Far from his illness
The wolves ran on through the evergreen forests,
The peasant river was untempted by the fashionable quays;
By mourning tongues
The death of the poet was kept from his poems.
But for him it was his last afternoon as himself,
An afternoon of nurses and rumours;
The provinces of his body revolted,
The squares of his mind were empty,
Silence invaded the suburbs,
The current of his feeling failed; he became his admirers.
Now he is scattered among a hundred cities
And wholly given over to unfamiliar affections,
To find his happiness in another kind of wood
And be punished under a foreign code of conscience.
The words of a dead man
Are modified in the guts of the living.
But in the importance and noise of to-morrow
When the brokers are roaring like beasts on the floor of the bourse,
And the poor have the sufferings to which they are fairly accustomed
And each in the cell of himself is almost convinced of his freedom
A few thousand will think of this day
As one thinks of a day when one did something slightly unusual.
What instruments we have agree
The day of his death was a dark cold day.
  II
You were silly like us; your gift survived it all:
The parish of rich women, physical decay,
Yourself. Mad Ireland hurt you into poetry.
Now Ireland has her madness and her weather still,
For poetry makes nothing happen: it survives
In the valley of its making where executives
Would never want to tamper, flows on south
From ranches of isolation and the busy griefs,
Raw towns that we believe and die in; it survives,
A way of happening, a mouth.
  III
Earth, receive an honoured guest:
William Yeats is laid to rest.
Let the Irish vessel lie
Emptied of its poetry.
In the nightmare of the dark
All the dogs of Europe bark,
And the living nations wait,
Each sequestered in its hate;
Intellectual disgrace
Stares from every human face,
And the seas of pity lie
Locked and frozen in each eye.
Follow, poet, follow right
To the bottom of the night,
With your unconstraining voice
Still persuade us to rejoice;
With the farming of a verse
Make a vineyard of the curse,
Sing of human unsuccess
In a rapture of distress;
In the deserts of the heart
Let the healing fountain start,
In the prison of his days
Teach the free man how to praise."
Having it Out with Melancholy,"          If many remedies are prescribed
          for an illness, you may be certain
          that the illness has no cure.

  1  FROM THE NURSERY

When I was born, you waited 
behind a pile of linen in the nursery, 
and when we were alone, you lay down 
on top of me, pressing
the bile of desolation into every pore.

And from that day on 
everything under the sun and moon 
made me sad—even the yellow 
wooden beads that slid and spun 
along a spindle on my crib.

You taught me to exist without gratitude. 
You ruined my manners toward God:
""We're here simply to wait for death; 
the pleasures of earth are overrated.""

I only appeared to belong to my mother, 
to live among blocks and cotton undershirts 
with snaps; among red tin lunch boxes
and report cards in ugly brown slipcases. 
I was already yours—the anti-urge, 
the mutilator of souls.


2  BOTTLES

Elavil, Ludiomil, Doxepin, 
Norpramin, Prozac, Lithium, Xanax, 
Wellbutrin, Parnate, Nardil, Zoloft. 
The coated ones smell sweet or have 
no smell; the powdery ones smell 
like the chemistry lab at school 
that made me hold my breath.



3  SUGGESTION FROM A FRIEND

You wouldn't be so depressed
if you really believed in God.



4  OFTEN

Often I go to bed as soon after dinner 
as seems adult
(I mean I try to wait for dark)
in order to push away 
from the massive pain in sleep's 
frail wicker coracle.



5  ONCE THERE WAS LIGHT

Once, in my early thirties, I saw 
that I was a speck of light in the great 
river of light that undulates through time.

I was floating with the whole 
human family. We were all colors—those 
who are living now, those who have died, 
those who are not yet born. For a few

moments I floated, completely calm, 
and I no longer hated having to exist.

Like a crow who smells hot blood 
you came flying to pull me out 
of the glowing stream.
""I'll hold you up. I never let my dear 
ones drown!"" After that, I wept for days.



6  IN AND OUT

The dog searches until he finds me 
upstairs, lies down with a clatter 
of elbows, puts his head on my foot.

Sometimes the sound of his breathing 
saves my life—in and out, in 
and out; a pause, a long sigh. . . . 



7  PARDON

A piece of burned meat 
wears my clothes, speaks 
in my voice, dispatches obligations 
haltingly, or not at all.
It is tired of trying 
to be stouthearted, tired 
beyond measure.

We move on to the monoamine 
oxidase inhibitors. Day and night 
I feel as if I had drunk six cups 
of coffee, but the pain stops
abruptly. With the wonder 
and bitterness of someone pardoned 
for a crime she did not commit 
I come back to marriage and friends, 
to pink fringed hollyhocks; come back 
to my desk, books, and chair.



8  CREDO

Pharmaceutical wonders are at work 
but I believe only in this moment 
of well-being. Unholy ghost, 
you are certain to come again.

Coarse, mean, you'll put your feet 
on the coffee table, lean back, 
and turn me into someone who can't 
take the trouble to speak; someone 
who can't sleep, or who does nothing 
but sleep; can't read, or call 
for an appointment for help.

There is nothing I can do 
against your coming. 
When I awake, I am still with thee.



9  WOOD THRUSH

High on Nardil and June light 
I wake at four, 
waiting greedily for the first
note of the wood thrush. Easeful air 
presses through the screen 
with the wild, complex song 
of the bird, and I am overcome

by ordinary contentment. 
What hurt me so terribly 
all my life until this moment? 
How I love the small, swiftly 
beating heart of the bird 
singing in the great maples; 
its bright, unequivocal eye."
And death shall have no dominion,"And death shall have no dominion.
Dead men naked they shall be one
With the man in the wind and the west moon;
When their bones are picked clean and the clean bones gone,
They shall have stars at elbow and foot;
Though they go mad they shall be sane,
Though they sink through the sea they shall rise again;
Though lovers be lost love shall not;
And death shall have no dominion.
And death shall have no dominion.
Under the windings of the sea
They lying long shall not die windily;
Twisting on racks when sinews give way,
Strapped to a wheel, yet they shall not break;
Faith in their hands shall snap in two,
And the unicorn evils run them through;
Split all ends up they shan't crack;
And death shall have no dominion.
And death shall have no dominion.
No more may gulls cry at their ears
Or waves break loud on the seashores;
Where blew a flower may a flower no more
Lift its head to the blows of the rain;
Though they be mad and dead as nails,
Heads of the characters hammer through daisies;
Break in the sun till the sun breaks down,
And death shall have no dominion."
When We Two Parted,"When we two parted
   In silence and tears,
Half broken-hearted
   To sever for years,
Pale grew thy cheek and cold,
   Colder thy kiss;
Truly that hour foretold
   Sorrow to this.
The dew of the morning
   Sunk chill on my brow— 
It felt like the warning
   Of what I feel now.
Thy vows are all broken,
   And light is thy fame;
I hear thy name spoken,
   And share in its shame.
They name thee before me,
   A knell to mine ear;
A shudder comes o'er me—
   Why wert thou so dear?
They know not I knew thee,
   Who knew thee too well—
Long, long shall I rue thee,
   Too deeply to tell.
In secret we met—
   In silence I grieve,
That thy heart could forget,
   Thy spirit deceive.
If I should meet thee
   After long years,
How should I greet thee?—
   With silence and tears."
The Myth of Innocence,"One summer she goes into the field as usual
stopping for a bit at the pool where she often
looks at herself, to see
if she detects any changes. She sees
the same person, the horrible mantle
of daughterliness still clinging to her.

The sun seems, in the water, very close.
That's my uncle spying again, she thinks—
everything in nature is in some way her relative.
I am never alone, she thinks,
turning the thought into a prayer.
Then death appears, like the answer to a prayer.

No one understands anymore
how beautiful he was. But Persephone remembers.
Also that he embraced her, right there,
with her uncle watching. She remembers
sunlight flashing on his bare arms.

This is the last moment she remembers clearly.
Then the dark god bore her away.

She also remembers, less clearly,
the chilling insight that from this moment
she couldn't live without him again.

The girl who disappears from the pool
will never return. A woman will return,
looking for the girl she was.

She stands by the pool saying, from time to time,
I was abducted, but it sounds
wrong to her, nothing like what she felt.
Then she says, I was not abducted.
Then she says, I offered myself, I wanted
to escape my body. Even, sometimes,
I willed this. But ignorance

cannot will knowledge. Ignorance
wills something imagined, which it believes exists.

All the different nouns—
she says them in rotation.
Death, husband, god, stranger.
Everything sounds so simple, so conventional.
I must have been, she thinks, a simple girl.

She can't remember herself as that person
but she keeps thinking the pool will remember
and explain to her the meaning of her prayer
so she can understand
whether it was answered or not."
The Angel,"I dreamt a dream!  What can it mean?
And that I was a maiden Queen
Guarded by an Angel mild:
Witless woe was ne’er beguiled!

And I wept both night and day,
And he wiped my tears away;
And I wept both day and night,
And hid from him my heart’s delight.

So he took his wings, and fled;
Then the morn blushed rosy red.
I dried my tears, and armed my fears
With ten thousand shields and spears.

Soon my Angel came again;
I was armed, he came in vain;
For the time of youth was fled,
And grey hairs were on my head."
Enigma,"It would be easy to forgive,
If I could but remember;
If I could hear, lost love of mine,
The music of your cruelties,
Shaking to sound the silent skies,
Could voice with them their song divine,
Red with pain’s leaping ember:
It would be easy to forgive,
If I could but remember.
It would be easy to forget,
If I could find lost Sorrow;
If I could kiss her plaintive face,
And break with her her bitter bread,
Could share again her woeful bed,
And know with tears her pale embrace.
Make yesterday, to-morrow:
It would be easy to forget,
If I could find lost Sorrow.
 "
The Watchers,"Beside a stricken field I stood;
On the torn turf, on grass and wood,
Hung heavily the dew of blood.
Still in their fresh mounds lay the slain,
But all the air was quick with pain
And gusty sighs and tearful rain.
Two angels, each with drooping head
And folded wings and noiseless treads,
Watched by that valley of the dead.
The one, with forehead saintly bland
And lips of blessing, not command,
Leaned, weeping, on her olive wand.
The other’s brows were scarred and knit,
His restless eyes were watch-fires lit,
His hands for battle-gauntlets fit.
“How long!”—I knew the voice of Peace,
“Is there no respite? no release?
When shall the hopeless quarrel cease?
“O Lord, how long! One human soul
Is more than any parchment scroll,
Or any flag thy winds unroll.
“What price was Ellsworth’s, young and brave?
How weigh the gift that Lyon gave,
Or count the cost of Winthrop’s grave?
“O brother! if thine eye can see,
Tell how and when the end shall be,
What hope remains for thee and me.”
Then Freedom sternly said: “I shun
No strife nor pang beneath the sun,
When human rights are staked and won.
“I knelt with Ziska’s hunted flock,
I watched in Toussaint’s cell of rock,
I walked with Sidney to the block.
“The moor of Marston felt my tread,
Through Jersey snows the march I led,
My voice Magenta’s charges sped.
“But now, through weary day and night,
I watch a vague and aimless fight
For leave to strike one blow aright.
“On either side my foe they own:
One guards through love his ghastly throne,
And one through fear to reverence grown.
“Why wait we longer, mocked, betrayed,
By open foes, or those afraid
To speed thy coming through my aid?
“Why watch to see who win or fall?
I shake the dust against them all,
I leave them to their senseless brawl.”
“Nay,” Peace implored: “yet longer wait;
The doom is near, the stake is great:
God knoweth if it be too late.
“Still wait and watch; the way prepare
Where I with folded wings of prayer
May follow, weaponless and bare.”
“Too late!” the stern, sad voice replied,
“Too late!” its mournful echo sighed,
In low lament the answer died.
A rustling as of wings in flight,
An upward gleam of lessening white,
So passed the vision, sound and sight.
But round me, like a silver bell
Rung down the listening sky to tell
Of holy help, a sweet voice fell.
“Still hope and trust,” it sang; “the rod
Must fall, the wine-press must be trod,
But all is possible with God!”"
One Today,"A Poem for Barack Obama’s Presidential Inauguration
January 21, 2013
  One sun rose on us today, kindled over our shores,
peeking over the Smokies, greeting the faces
of the Great Lakes, spreading a simple truth
across the Great Plains, then charging across the Rockies.
One light, waking up rooftops, under each one, a story
told by our silent gestures moving behind windows.
My face, your face, millions of faces in morning’s mirrors,
each one yawning to life, crescendoing into our day:
pencil-yellow school buses, the rhythm of traffic lights,
fruit stands: apples, limes, and oranges arrayed like rainbows
begging our praise. Silver trucks heavy with oil or paper—
bricks or milk, teeming over highways alongside us,
on our way to clean tables, read ledgers, or save lives—
to teach geometry, or ring-up groceries as my mother did
for twenty years, so I could write this poem.
All of us as vital as the one light we move through,
the same light on blackboards with lessons for the day:
equations to solve, history to question, or atoms imagined,
the “I have a dream” we keep dreaming,
or the impossible vocabulary of sorrow that won’t explain
the empty desks of twenty children marked absent
today, and forever. Many prayers, but one light
breathing color into stained glass windows,
life into the faces of bronze statues, warmth
onto the steps of our museums and park benches
as mothers watch children slide into the day.
One ground. Our ground, rooting us to every stalk
of corn, every head of wheat sown by sweat
and hands, hands gleaning coal or planting windmills
in deserts and hilltops that keep us warm, hands
digging trenches, routing pipes and cables, hands
as worn as my father’s cutting sugarcane
so my brother and I could have books and shoes.
The dust of farms and deserts, cities and plains
mingled by one wind—our breath. Breathe. Hear it
through the day’s gorgeous din of honking cabs,
buses launching down avenues, the symphony
of footsteps, guitars, and screeching subways,
the unexpected song bird on your clothes line.
Hear: squeaky playground swings, trains whistling,
or whispers across café tables, Hear: the doors we open
for each other all day, saying: hello / shalom,
buon giorno / howdy / namaste / or buenos días
in the language my mother taught me—in every language
spoken into one wind carrying our lives
without prejudice, as these words break from my lips.
One sky: since the Appalachians and Sierras claimed
their majesty, and the Mississippi and Colorado worked
their way to the sea. Thank the work of our hands:
weaving steel into bridges, finishing one more report
for the boss on time, stitching another wound
or uniform, the first brush stroke on a portrait,
or the last floor on the Freedom Tower
jutting into a sky that yields to our resilience.
One sky, toward which we sometimes lift our eyes
tired from work: some days guessing at the weather
of our lives, some days giving thanks for a love
that loves you back, sometimes praising a mother
who knew how to give, or forgiving a father
who couldn’t give what you wanted.
We head home: through the gloss of rain or weight
of snow, or the plum blush of dusk, but always—home,
always under one sky, our sky. And always one moon
like a silent drum tapping on every rooftop
and every window, of one country—all of us—
facing the stars
hope—a new constellation
waiting for us to map it,
waiting for us to name it—together
Watch Richard Blanco read “One Today” at President Obama’s inauguration in 2013:"
Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening,"Whose woods these are I think I know.
His house is in the village though;
He will not see me stopping here
To watch his woods fill up with snow.
My little horse must think it queer
To stop without a farmhouse near
Between the woods and frozen lake
The darkest evening of the year.
He gives his harness bells a shake
To ask if there is some mistake.
The only other sound's the sweep
Of easy wind and downy flake.
The woods are lovely, dark and deep.
But I have promises to keep,
And miles to go before I sleep,
And miles to go before I sleep."
"Paradise Lost, Book I, Lines 221-270","s this the Region, this the Soil, the Clime,
Said then the lost Arch-Angel, this the seat
That we must change for Heav'n, this mournful gloom
For that celestial light? Be it so, since he
Who now is Sovran can dispose and bid
What shall be right: fardest from him is best
Whom reason hath equald, force hath made supream
Above his equals. Farewel happy Fields
Where Joy for ever dwells: Hail horrours, hail
Infernal world, and thou profoundest Hell
Receive thy new Possessor: One who brings
A mind not to be chang'd by Place or Time.
The mind is its own place, and in it self
Can make a Heav'n of Hell, a Hell of Heav'n.
What matter where, if I be still the same,
And what I should be, all but less then he
Whom Thunder hath made greater? Here at least
We shall be free; th' Almighty hath not built
Here for his envy, will not drive us hence:
Here we may reign secure, and in my choyce
To reign is worth ambition though in Hell:
Better to reign in Hell, then serve in Heav'n.
But wherefore let we then our faithful friends,
Th' associates and copartners of our loss
Lye thus astonisht on th' oblivious Pool,
And call them not to share with us their part
In this unhappy Mansion, or once more
With rallied Arms to try what may be yet
Regaind in Heav'n, or what more lost in Hell?"
I measure every Grief I meet (561),"I measure every Grief I meet
With narrow, probing, eyes – 
I wonder if It weighs like Mine – 
Or has an Easier size.

I wonder if They bore it long – 
Or did it just begin – 
I could not tell the Date of Mine – 
It feels so old a pain – 

I wonder if it hurts to live – 
And if They have to try – 
And whether – could They choose between – 
It would not be – to die – 

I note that Some – gone patient long – 
At length, renew their smile –  
An imitation of a Light
That has so little Oil – 

I wonder if when Years have piled –  
Some Thousands – on the Harm –  
That hurt them early – such a lapse
Could give them any Balm –  

Or would they go on aching still
Through Centuries of Nerve – 
Enlightened to a larger Pain –  
In Contrast with the Love –  

The Grieved – are many – I am told –  
There is the various Cause –  
Death – is but one – and comes but once –  
And only nails the eyes –  

There's Grief of Want – and grief of Cold –  
A sort they call ""Despair"" –  
There's Banishment from native Eyes – 
In sight of Native Air –  

And though I may not guess the kind –  
Correctly – yet to me
A piercing Comfort it affords
In passing Calvary –  

To note the fashions – of the Cross –  
And how they're mostly worn –  
Still fascinated to presume
That Some – are like my own – "
Song of Nature,"Mine are the night and morning,
The pits of air, the gulf of space,
The sportive sun, the gibbous moon,
The innumerable days.
I hid in the solar glory,
I am dumb in the pealing song,
I rest on the pitch of the torrent,
In slumber I am strong.
No numbers have counted my tallies,
No tribes my house can fill,
I sit by the shining Fount of Life,
And pour the deluge still;
And ever by delicate powers
Gathering along the centuries
From race on race the rarest flowers,
My wreath shall nothing miss.
And many a thousand summers
My apples ripened well,
And light from meliorating stars
With firmer glory fell.
I wrote the past in characters
Of rock and fire the scroll,
The building in the coral sea,
The planting of the coal.
And thefts from satellites and rings
And broken stars I drew,
And out of spent and aged things
I formed the world anew;
What time the gods kept carnival,
Tricked out in star and flower,
And in cramp elf and saurian forms
They swathed their too much power.
Time and Thought were my surveyors,
They laid their courses well,
They boiled the sea, and baked the layers
Or granite, marl, and shell.
But he, the man-child glorious,—
Where tarries he the while?
The rainbow shines his harbinger,
The sunset gleams his smile.
My boreal lights leap upward,
Forthright my planets roll,
And still the man-child is not born,
The summit of the whole.
Must time and tide forever run?
Will never my winds go sleep in the west?
Will never my wheels which whirl the sun
And satellites have rest?
Too much of donning and doffing,
Too slow the rainbow fades,
I weary of my robe of snow,
My leaves and my cascades;
I tire of globes and races,
Too long the game is played;
What without him is summer's pomp,
Or winter’s frozen shade?
I travail in pain for him,
My creatures travail and wait;
His couriers come by squadrons,
He comes not to the gate.
Twice I have moulded an image,
And thrice outstretched my hand,
Made one of day, and one of night,
And one of the salt sea-sand.
One in a Judaean manger,
And one by Avon stream,
One over against the mouths of Nile,
And one in the Academe.
I moulded kings and saviours,
And bards o’er kings to rule;—
But fell the starry influence short,
The cup was never full.
Yet whirl the glowing wheels once more,
And mix the bowl again;
Seethe, fate! the ancient elements,
Heat, cold, wet, dry, and peace, and pain.
Let war and trade and creeds and song
Blend, ripen race on race,
The sunburnt world a man shall breed
Of all the zones, and countless days.
No ray is dimmed, no atom worn,
My oldest force is good as new,
And the fresh rose on yonder thorn
Gives back the bending heavens in dew."
The Road Not Taken,"Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,
And sorry I could not travel both
And be one traveler, long I stood
And looked down one as far as I could
To where it bent in the undergrowth;
Then took the other, as just as fair,
And having perhaps the better claim,
Because it was grassy and wanted wear;
Though as for that the passing there
Had worn them really about the same,
And both that morning equally lay
In leaves no step had trodden black.
Oh, I kept the first for another day!
Yet knowing how way leads on to way,
I doubted if I should ever come back.
I shall be telling this with a sigh
Somewhere ages and ages hence:
Two roads diverged in a wood, and I—
I took the one less traveled by,
And that has made all the difference."
The Walrus and the Carpenter,"The sun was shining on the sea,
   Shining with all his might:
He did his very best to make
   The billows smooth and bright—
And this was odd, because it was
   The middle of the night.
The moon was shining sulkily,
   Because she thought the sun
Had got no business to be there
   After the day was done—
""It's very rude of him,"" she said,
   ""To come and spoil the fun!""
The sea was wet as wet could be,
   The sands were dry as dry.
You could not see a cloud because
   No cloud was in the sky:
No birds were flying overhead—
   There were no birds to fly.
The Walrus and the Carpenter
   Were walking close at hand:
They wept like anything to see
   Such quantities of sand:
""If this were only cleared away,""
   They said, ""it would be grand!""
""If seven maids with seven mops
   Swept it for half a year,
Do you suppose,"" the Walrus said,
   ""That they could get it clear?""
""I doubt it,"" said the Carpenter,
   And shed a bitter tear.
""0 Oysters, come and walk with us!""
   The Walrus did beseech.
""A pleasant walk, a pleasant talk,
   Along the briny beach:
We cannot do with more than four,
   To give a hand to each.""
The eldest Oyster looked at him,
   But never a word he said;
The eldest Oyster winked his eye,
   And shook his heavy head—
Meaning to say he did not choose
   To leave the oyster-bed.
But four young Oysters hurried up,
   All eager for the treat:
Their coats were brushed, their faces washed,
   Their shoes were clean and neat—
And this was odd, because, you know,
   They hadn't any feet.
Four other Oysters followed them,
   And yet another four;
And thick and fast they came at last,
   And more and more and more—
All hopping through the frothy waves,
   And scrambling to the shore.
The Walrus and the Carpenter
   Walked on a mile or so,
And then they rested on a rock
   Conveniently low:
And all the little Oysters stood
   And waited in a row.
""The time has come,"" the Walrus said,
   ""To talk of many things:
Of shoes—and ships—and sealing-wax—
   Of cabbages—and kings—
And why the sea is boiling hot—
   And whether pigs have wings.""
""But wait a bit,"" the Oysters cried,
   ""Before we have our chat;
For some of us are out of breath,
   And all of us are fat!""
""No hurry!"" said the Carpenter.
   They thanked him much for that.
""A loaf of bread,"" the Walrus said,
   ""Is what we chiefly need:
Pepper and vinegar besides
   Are very good indeed—
Now, if you're ready, Oysters dear,
   We can begin to feed.""
""But not on us!"" the Oysters cried,
   Turning a little blue.
""After such kindness, that would be
   A dismal thing to do!""
""The night is fine,"" the Walrus said,
   ""Do you admire the view?
""It was so kind of you to come!
   And you are very nice!""
The Carpenter said nothing but
   ""Cut us another slice.
I wish you were not quite so deaf—
   I've had to ask you twice!""
""It seems a shame,"" the Walrus said,
   ""To play them such a trick.
After we've brought them out so far,
   And made them trot so quick!""
The Carpenter said nothing but
   ""The butter's spread too thick!""
""I weep for you,"" the Walrus said:
   ""I deeply sympathize.""
With sobs and tears he sorted out
   Those of the largest size,
Holding his pocket-handkerchief
   Before his streaming eyes.
""0 Oysters,"" said the Carpenter,
   ""You've had a pleasant run!
Shall we be trotting home again?""
   But answer came there none—
And this was scarcely odd, because
   They'd eaten every one."
Kubla Khan,"Or a Vision in a Dream. A Fragment
In Xanadu did Kubla Khan
A stately pleasure dome decree:
Where Alph, the sacred river, ran
Through caverns measureless to man
    Down to a sunless sea.
So twice five miles of fertile ground
With walls and towers were girdled round:
And there were gardens bright with sinuous rills,
Where blossomed many an incense-bearing tree;
And here were forests ancient as the hills,
Enfolding sunny spots of greenery.
But oh! that deep romantic chasm which slanted
Down the green hill athwart a cedarn cover!
A savage place! as holy and enchanted
As e'er beneath a waning moon was haunted
By woman wailing for her demon lover!
And from this chasm, with ceaseless turmoil seething,
As if this earth in fast thick pants were breathing,
A mighty fountain momently was forced:
Amid whose swift half-intermitted burst
Huge fragments vaulted like rebounding hail,
Or chaffy grain beneath the thresher's flail:
And ’mid these dancing rocks at once and ever
It flung up momently the sacred river.
Five miles meandering with a mazy motion
Through wood and dale the sacred river ran,
Then reached the caverns measureless to man,
And sank in tumult to a lifeless ocean:
And ’mid this tumult Kubla heard from far
Ancestral voices prophesying war!
    The shadow of the dome of pleasure
    Floated midway on the waves;
    Where was heard the mingled measure
    From the fountain and the caves.
It was a miracle of rare device,
A sunny pleasure-dome with caves of ice!
    A damsel with a dulcimer
    In a vision once I saw;
    It was an Abyssinian maid,
    And on her dulcimer she played,
    Singing of Mount Abora.
    Could I revive within me
    Her symphony and song,
    To such a deep delight ’twould win me,
That with music loud and long,
I would build that dome in air,
That sunny dome! those caves of ice!
And all who heard should see them there,
And all should cry, Beware! Beware!
His flashing eyes, his floating hair!
Weave a circle round him thrice,
And close your eyes with holy dread,
For he on honey-dew hath fed,
And drunk the milk of Paradise."
On Love,"Then said Almitra, Speak to us of Love.
     And he raised his head and looked upon the people, and there fell a stillness upon them. And with a great voice he said:
     When love beckons to you, follow him,
     Though his ways are hard and steep.
     And when his wings enfold you yield to him,
     Though the sword hidden among his pinions may wound you.
     And when he speaks to you believe in him,
     Though his voice may shatter your dreams as the north wind lays waste the garden.
     For even as love crowns you so shall he crucify you. Even as he is for your growth so is he for your pruning.
     Even as he ascends to your height and caresses your tenderest branches that quiver in the sun,
     So shall he descend to your roots and shake them in their clinging to the earth.
     Like sheaves of corn he gathers you unto himself
     He threshes you to make your naked.
     He sifts you to free you from your husks.
     He grinds you to whiteness.
     He kneads you until you are pliant;
     And then he assigns you to his sacred fire, that you may become sacred bread for God’s sacred feast.
     All these things shall love do unto you that you may know the secrets of your heart, and in that knowledge become a fragment of Life’s heart.
     But if in your heart you would seek only love’s peace and love’s pleasure,
     Then it is better for you that you cover your nakedness and pass out of love’s threshing-floor,
     Into the seasonless world where you shall laugh, but not all of your laughter, and weep, but not all of your tears.
     Love gives naught but itself and takes naught but from itself.
     Love possesses not nor would it be possessed;
     For love is sufficient unto love.
     When you love you should not say, “God is in my heart,” but rather, “I am in the heart of God.”
     And think not you can direct the course of love, for love, if it finds you worthy, directs your course.
     Love has no other desire but to fulfil itself.
     But if you love and must needs have desires, let these be your desires:
     To melt and be like a running brook that sings its melody to the night.
     To know the pain of too much tenderness.
     To be wounded by your own understanding of love;
     And to bleed willingly and joyfully.
     To wake at dawn with a winged heart and give thanks for another day of loving;
     To rest at the noon hour and meditate love’s ecstasy;
     To return home at eventide with gratitude;
     And then to sleep with a prayer for the beloved in your heart and a song of praise upon your lips."
I Have a Rendezvous with Death,"I have a rendezvous with Death
At some disputed barricade,
When Spring comes back with rustling shade
And apple-blossoms fill the air—
I have a rendezvous with Death
When Spring brings back blue days and fair.
It may be he shall take my hand
And lead me into his dark land
And close my eyes and quench my breath—
It may be I shall pass him still.
I have a rendezvous with Death
On some scarred slope of battered hill,
When Spring comes round again this year
And the first meadow-flowers appear.
God knows ’twere better to be deep
Pillowed in silk and scented down,
Where love throbs out in blissful sleep,
Pulse nigh to pulse, and breath to breath,
Where hushed awakenings are dear...
But I’ve a rendezvous with Death
At midnight in some flaming town,
When Spring trips north again this year,
And I to my pledged word am true,
I shall not fail that rendezvous."
On Joy and Sorrow,"Then a woman said, Speak to us of Joy and Sorrow.
And he answered:
Your joy is your sorrow unmasked.
And the selfsame well from which your laughter rises was oftentimes filled with your tears.
And how else can it be?
The deeper that sorrow carves into your being, the more joy you can contain.
Is not the cup that holds your wine the very cup that was burned in the potter’s oven?
And is not the lute that soothes your spirit, the very wood that was hollowed with knives?
When you are joyous, look deep into your heart and you shall find it is only that which has given you sorrow that is giving you joy.
When you are sorrowful look again in your heart, and you shall see that in truth you are weeping for that which has been your delight.
Some of you say, “Joy is greater than sorrow,” and others say, “Nay, sorrow is the greater.”
But I say unto you, they are inseparable.
Together they come, and when one sits alone with you at your board, remember that the other is asleep upon your bed.
Verily you are suspended like scales between your sorrow and your joy.
Only when you are empty are you at standstill and balanced.
When the treasure-keeper lifts you to weigh his gold and his silver, needs must your joy or your sorrow rise or fall."
Instructions on Not Giving Up,"More than the fuchsia funnels breaking out
of the crabapple tree, more than the neighbor’s
almost obscene display of cherry limbs shoving
their cotton candy-colored blossoms to the slate
sky of Spring rains, it’s the greening of the trees
that really gets to me. When all the shock of white
and taffy, the world’s baubles and trinkets, leave
the pavement strewn with the confetti of aftermath,
the leaves come. Patient, plodding, a green skin
growing over whatever winter did to us, a return
to the strange idea of continuous living despite
the mess of us, the hurt, the empty. Fine then,
I’ll take it, the tree seems to say, a new slick leaf
unfurling like a fist to an open palm, I’ll take it all."
Yours,"I am yours as the summer air at evening is
Possessed by the scent of linden blossoms,

As the snowcap gleams with light
Lent it by the brimming moon.

Without you I'd be an unleafed tree
Blasted in a bleakness with no Spring.

Your love is the weather of my being.
What is an island without the sea?"
Under the Harvest Moon,"   Under the harvest moon, 
When the soft silver
Drips shimmering
Over the garden nights,
Death, the gray mocker, 
Comes and whispers to you
As a beautiful friend
Who remembers.

   Under the summer roses 
When the flagrant crimson
Lurks in the dusk
Of the wild red leaves,
Love, with little hands,
Comes and touches you
With a thousand memories, 
And asks you
Beautiful, unanswerable questions."
The Stolen Child,"Where dips the rocky highland
Of Sleuth Wood in the lake,
There lies a leafy island
Where flapping herons wake
The drowsy water rats;
There we've hid our faery vats,
Full of berrys
And of reddest stolen cherries.
Come away, O human child!
To the waters and the wild
With a faery, hand in hand,
For the world's more full of weeping than you can understand.
Where the wave of moonlight glosses
The dim gray sands with light,
Far off by furthest Rosses
We foot it all the night,
Weaving olden dances
Mingling hands and mingling glances
Till the moon has taken flight;
To and fro we leap
And chase the frothy bubbles,
While the world is full of troubles
And anxious in its sleep.
Come away, O human child!
To the waters and the wild
With a faery, hand in hand,
For the world's more full of weeping than you can understand.
Where the wandering water gushes
From the hills above Glen-Car,
In pools among the rushes
That scarce could bathe a star,
We seek for slumbering trout
And whispering in their ears
Give them unquiet dreams;
Leaning softly out
From ferns that drop their tears
Over the young streams.
Come away, O human child!
To the waters and the wild
With a faery, hand in hand,
For the world's more full of weeping than you can understand.
Away with us he's going,
The solemn-eyed:
He'll hear no more the lowing
Of the calves on the warm hillside
Or the kettle on the hob
Sing peace into his breast,
Or see the brown mice bob
Round and round the oatmeal chest.
For he comes, the human child,
To the waters and the wild
With a faery, hand in hand,
For the world's more full of weeping than he can understand."
Ars Poetica,"A poem should be palpable and mute
As a globed fruit,
Dumb
As old medallions to the thumb,
Silent as the sleeve-worn stone
Of casement ledges where the moss has grown—
A poem should be wordless
As the flight of birds.
                 *
A poem should be motionless in time
As the moon climbs,
Leaving, as the moon releases
Twig by twig the night-entangled trees,
Leaving, as the moon behind the winter leaves,
Memory by memory the mind—
A poem should be motionless in time
As the moon climbs.
                  *
A poem should be equal to:
Not true.
For all the history of grief
An empty doorway and a maple leaf.
For love
The leaning grasses and two lights above the sea—
A poem should not mean
But be."
Novel,"I.

No one's serious at seventeen.
—On beautiful nights when beer and lemonade
And loud, blinding cafés are the last thing you need
—You stroll beneath green lindens on the promenade.

Lindens smell fine on fine June nights!
Sometimes the air is so sweet that you close your eyes;
The wind brings sounds—the town is near—
And carries scents of vineyards and beer. . .

II.

—Over there, framed by a branch
You can see a little patch of dark blue
Stung by a sinister star that fades
With faint quiverings, so small and white. . .

June nights! Seventeen!—Drink it in.
Sap is champagne, it goes to your head. . .
The mind wanders, you feel a kiss
On your lips, quivering like a living thing. . .

III.

The wild heart Crusoes through a thousand novels
—And when a young girl walks alluringly
Through a streetlamp's pale light, beneath the ominous shadow
Of her father's starched collar. . .

Because as she passes by, boot heels tapping,
She turns on a dime, eyes wide, 
Finding you too sweet to resist. . .
—And cavatinas die on your lips.

IV.

You're in love. Off the market till August.
You're in love.—Your sonnets make Her laugh.
Your friends are gone, you're bad news.
—Then, one night, your beloved, writes. . .!

That night. . .you return to the blinding cafés;
You order beer or lemonade. . .
—No one's serious at seventeen 
When lindens line the promenade.

Not Waving but Drowning,"Nobody heard him, the dead man,
But still he lay moaning:
I was much further out than you thought
And not waving but drowning.
Poor chap, he always loved larking
And now he’s dead
It must have been too cold for him his heart gave way,
They said.
Oh, no no no, it was too cold always
(Still the dead one lay moaning)
I was much too far out all my life
And not waving but drowning."
"To John Keats, Poet. At Spring Time*","(For Carl Van Vechten)
I cannot hold my peace, John Keats;
There never was a spring like this;
It is an echo, that repeats
My last year's song and next year's bliss.
I know, in spite of all men say
Of Beauty, you have felt her most.
Yea, even in your grave her way
Is laid. Poor, troubled, lyric ghost,
Spring never was so fair and dear
As Beauty makes her seem this year.
I cannot hold my peace, John Keats,
I am as helpless in the toil
Of Spring as any lamb that bleats
To feel the solid earth recoil
Beneath his puny legs. Spring beats
Her tocsin call to those who love her,
And lo! the dogwood petals cover
Her breast with drifts of snow, and sleek
White gulls fly screaming to her, and hover
About her shoulders, and kiss her cheek,
While white and purple lilacs muster
A strength that bears them to a cluster
Of color and odor; for her sake
All things that slept are now awake.
And you and I, shall we lie still,
John Keats, while Beauty summons us?
Somehow I feel your sensitive will
Is pulsing up some tremulous
Sap road of a maple tree, whose leaves
Grow music as they grow, since your
Wild voice is in them, a harp that grieves
For life that opens death's dark door.
Though dust, your fingers still can push
The Vision Splendid to a birth,
Though now they work as grass in the hush
Of the night on the broad sweet page of the earth.
""John Keats is dead,"" they say, but I
Who hear your full insistent cry
In bud and blossom, leaf and tree,
Know John Keats still writes poetry.
And while my head is earthward bowed
To read new life sprung from your shroud,
Folks seeing me must think it strange
That merely spring should so derange
My mind. They do not know that you,
John Keats, keep revel with me, too.
  *Spring, 1924"
Final Soliloquy of the Interior Paramour,"Light the first light of evening, as in a room
In which we rest and, for small reason, think
The world imagined is the ultimate good.

This is, therefore, the intensest rendezvous. 
It is in that thought that we collect ourselves,
Out of all the indifferences, into one thing:

Within a single thing, a single shawl
Wrapped tightly round us, since we are poor, a warmth, 
A light, a power, the miraculous influence.

Here, now, we forget each other and ourselves.
We feel the obscurity of an order, a whole, 
A knowledge, that which arranged the rendezvous.

Within its vital boundary, in the mind.
We say God and the imagination are one... 
How high that highest candle lights the dark.

Out of this same light, out of the central mind, 
We make a dwelling in the evening air, 
In which being there together is enough."
"The Merchant of Venice, Act IV, Scene I [The quality of mercy is not strained]","The quality of mercy is not strained;
It droppeth as the gentle rain from heaven
Upon the place beneath. It is twice blest;
It blesseth him that gives and him that takes:
'T is mightiest in the mightiest; it becomes
The throned monarch better than his crown:
His sceptre shows the force of temporal power,
The attribute to awe and majesty,
Wherein doth sit the dread and fear of kings;
But mercy is above this sceptred sway;
It is enthronèd in the hearts of kings,
It is an attribute to God himself;
And earthly power doth then show likest God's
When mercy seasons justice. Therefore, Jew,
Though justice be thy plea, consider this,
That, in the course of justice, none of us
Should see salvation: we do pray for mercy;
And that same prayer doth teach us all to render
The deeds of mercy. I have spoke thus much
To mitigate the justice of thy plea;
Which if thou follow, this strict court of Venice
Must needs give sentence 'gainst the merchant there."
Loveliest of Trees,"Loveliest of trees, the cherry now
Is hung with bloom along the bough,
And stands about the woodland ride
Wearing white for Eastertide.
Now, of my threescore years and ten,
Twenty will not come again,
And take from seventy springs a score,
It only leaves me fifty more.
And since to look at things in bloom
Fifty springs are little room,
About the woodlands I will go
To see the cherry hung with snow."
"Lay of the Last Minstrel, Canto VI, [My Native Land]","   Breathes there the man, with soul so dead,
Who never to himself hath said,
   This is my own, my native land!
Whose heart hath ne'er within him burn'd,
As home his footsteps he hath turn'd
   From wandering on a foreign strand!
If such there breathe, go, mark him well;
For him no Minstrel raptures swell;
High though his titles, proud his name,
Boundless his wealth as wish can claim;—
Despite those titles, power, and pelf,
The wretch, concentred all in self,
Living, shall forfeit fair renown,
And, doubly dying, shall go down
To the vile dust, from whence he sprung,
Unwept, unhonour'd, and unsung."
The Land of Counterpane,"When I was sick and lay a-bed,
I had two pillows at my head,
And all my toys beside me lay
To keep me happy all the day.
And sometimes for an hour or so
I watched my leaden soldiers go,
With different uniforms and drills,
Among the bed-clothes, through the hills;
And sometimes sent my ships in fleets
All up and down among the sheets;
Or brought my trees and houses out,
And planted cities all about.
I was the giant great and still
That sits upon the pillow-hill,
And sees before him, dale and plain,
The pleasant land of counterpane."
Aedh Wishes for the Cloths of Heaven,"Had I the heavens' embroidered cloths,
Enwrought with golden and silver light,
The blue and the dim and the dark cloths
Of night and light and the half light,
I would spread the cloths under your feet:
But I, being poor, have only my dreams;
I have spread my dreams under your feet;
Tread softly because you tread on my dreams."
Love's Philosophy,"The fountains mingle with the river
And the rivers with the ocean,
The winds of heaven mix for ever
With a sweet emotion;
Nothing in the world is single,
All things by a law divine
In one another's being mingle—
Why not I with thine?
See the mountains kiss high heaven,
And the waves clasp one another;
No sister-flower would be forgiven
If it disdain'd its brother;
And the sunlight clasps the earth,
And the moonbeams kiss the sea—
What is all this sweet work worth
If thou kiss not me?"
Before You Came,"Before you came,
things were as they should be:
the sky was the dead-end of sight,
the road was just a road, wine merely wine.

Now everything is like my heart,
a color at the edge of blood:
the grey of your absence, the color of poison, of thorns,
the gold when we meet, the season ablaze,
the yellow of autumn, the red of flowers, of flames,
and the black when you cover the earth
with the coal of dead fires.

And the sky, the road, the glass of wine?
The sky is a shirt wet with tears,
the road a vein about to break,
and the glass of wine a mirror in which
the sky, the road, the world keep changing.

Don't leave now that you're here—
Stay. So the world may become like itself again:
so the sky may be the sky,
the road a road,
and the glass of wine not a mirror, just a glass of wine."

Ozymandias,"I met a traveller from an antique land
Who said: “Two vast and trunkless legs of stone
Stand in the desert . . . Near them, on the sand,
Half sunk, a shattered visage lies, whose frown,
And wrinkled lip, and sneer of cold command,
Tell that its sculptor well those passions read
Which yet survive, stamped on these lifeless things,
The hand that mocked them, and the heart that fed:
And on the pedestal these words appear:
‘My name is Ozymandias, king of kings:
Look on my works, ye Mighty, and despair!’
Nothing beside remains. Round the decay
Of that colossal wreck, boundless and bare
The lone and level sands stretch far away.”"
Little Orphant Annie,"Little Orphant Annie’s come to our house to stay,
An’ wash the cups an’ saucers up, an’ brush the crumbs away,
An’ shoo the chickens off the porch, an’ dust the hearth, an’ sweep,
An’ make the fire, an’ bake the bread, an’ earn her board-an’-keep;
An’ all us other childern, when the supper things is done,
We set around the kitchen fire an’ has the mostest fun
A-list’nin’ to the witch-tales ‘at Annie tells about,
An’ the Gobble-uns ‘at gits you
             Ef you
                Don’t
                   Watch
                      Out!
Onc’t they was a little boy wouldn’t say his prayers,—
So when he went to bed at night, away up stairs,
His Mammy heerd him holler, an’ his Daddy heerd him bawl,
An’ when they turn’t the kivvers down, he wasn’t there at all!
An’ they seeked him in the rafter-room, an’ cubby-hole, an’ press,
An’ seeked him up the chimbly-flue, an’ ever’wheres, I guess;
But all they ever found was thist his pants an' roundabout--
An’ the Gobble-uns’ll git you
             Ef you
                Don’t
                   Watch
                      Out!
An’ one time a little girl ‘ud allus laugh an’ grin,
An’ make fun of ever’one, an’ all her blood an’ kin;
An’ onc’t, when they was “company,” an’ ole folks was there,
She mocked ‘em an’ shocked ‘em, an’ said she didn’t care!
An’ thist as she kicked her heels, an’ turn’t to run an’ hide,
They was two great big Black Things a-standin’ by her side,
An’ they snatched her through the ceilin’ ‘fore she knowed what she’s about!
An’ the Gobble-uns’ll git you
             Ef you
                Don’t
                   Watch
                      Out!
An’ little Orphant Annie says when the blaze is blue,
An’ the lamp-wick sputters, an’ the wind goes woo-oo!
An’ you hear the crickets quit, an’ the moon is gray,
An’ the lightnin’-bugs in dew is all squenched away,--
You better mind yer parents, an’ yer teachers fond an’ dear,
An’ churish them ‘at loves you, an’ dry the orphant’s tear,
An’ he’p the pore an’ needy ones ‘at clusters all about,
Er the Gobble-uns’ll git you
             Ef you
                Don’t
                   Watch
                      Out!"
A Blessing,"Just off the highway to Rochester, Minnesota,
Twilight bounds softly forth on the grass.
And the eyes of those two Indian ponies
Darken with kindness.
They have come gladly out of the willows
To welcome my friend and me.
We step over the barbed wire into the pasture
Where they have been grazing all day, alone.
They ripple tensely, they can hardly contain their happiness
That we have come.
They bow shyly as wet swans. They love each other.
There is no loneliness like theirs.
At home once more,
They begin munching the young tufts of spring in the darkness.
I would like to hold the slenderer one in my arms,
For she has walked over to me
And nuzzled my left hand.
She is black and white,
Her mane falls wild on her forehead,
And the light breeze moves me to caress her long ear
That is delicate as the skin over a girl’s wrist.
Suddenly I realize
That if I stepped out of my body I would break
Into blossom."
Life is Fine,"I went down to the river,
I set down on the bank.
I tried to think but couldn't,
So I jumped in and sank.
I came up once and hollered!
I came up twice and cried!
If that water hadn't a-been so cold
I might've sunk and died.
     But it was      Cold in that water!      It was cold!
I took the elevator
Sixteen floors above the ground.
I thought about my baby
And thought I would jump down.
I stood there and I hollered!
I stood there and I cried!
If it hadn't a-been so high
I might've jumped and died.
     But it was      High up there!      It was high!
So since I'm still here livin',
I guess I will live on.
I could've died for love—
But for livin' I was born
Though you may hear me holler,
And you may see me cry—
I'll be dogged, sweet baby,
If you gonna see me die.
     Life is fine!      Fine as wine!      Life is fine!"
"As You Like It, Act II, Scene VII [All the world's a stage]","Jaques to Duke Senior
                   
                          All the world's a stage,
And all the men and women merely players;
They have their exits and their entrances,
And one man in his time plays many parts,
His acts being seven ages. At first, the infant,
Mewling and puking in the nurse's arms.
Then the whining schoolboy, with his satchel
And shining morning face, creeping like snail
Unwillingly to school. And then the lover,
Sighing like furnace, with a woeful ballad
Made to his mistress' eyebrow. Then a soldier,
Full of strange oaths and bearded like the pard,
Jealous in honor, sudden and quick in quarrel,
Seeking the bubble reputation
Even in the cannon's mouth. And then the justice,
In fair round belly with good capon lined,
With eyes severe and beard of formal cut,
Full of wise saws and modern instances;
And so he plays his part. The sixth age shifts
Into the lean and slippered pantaloon,
With spectacles on nose and pouch on side;
His youthful hose, well saved, a world too wide
For his shrunk shank, and his big manly voice,
Turning again toward childish treble, pipes
And whistles in his sound. Last scene of all,
That ends this strange eventful history,
Is second childishness and mere oblivion,
Sans teeth, sans eyes, sans taste, sans everything.
 "
Shall I compare thee to a summer’s day? (Sonnet 18),"Shall I compare thee to a summer’s day?
Thou art more lovely and more temperate.
Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,
And summer’s lease hath all too short a date.
Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,
And often is his gold complexion dimmed;
And every fair from fair sometime declines,
By chance, or nature’s changing course, untrimmed;
But thy eternal summer shall not fade,
Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow’st,
Nor shall death brag thou wand'rest in his shade,
When in eternal lines to Time thou grow'st.
    So long as men can breathe, or eyes can see,
    So long lives this, and this gives life to thee."
To My Dear and Loving Husband,"If ever two were one, then surely we.
If ever man were loved by wife, then thee;
If ever wife was happy in a man,
Compare with me ye women if you can.
I prize thy love more than whole mines of gold,
Or all the riches that the East doth hold.
My love is such that rivers cannot quench,
Nor ought but love from thee give recompense.
Thy love is such I can no way repay;
The heavens reward thee manifold, I pray.
Then while we live, in love let’s so persever,
That when we live no more we may live ever."
A Dream Within a Dream,"Take this kiss upon the brow!
And, in parting from you now,
Thus much let me avow:
You are not wrong who deem
That my days have been a dream;
Yet if hope has flown away
In a night, or in a day,
In a vision, or in none,
Is it therefore the less gone?
All that we see or seem
Is but a dream within a dream.
I stand amid the roar
Of a surf-tormented shore,
And I hold within my hand
Grains of the golden sand--
How few! yet how they creep
Through my fingers to the deep,
While I weep--while I weep!
O God! can I not grasp
Them with a tighter clasp?
O God! can I not save
One from the pitiless wave?
Is all that we see or seem
But a dream within a dream?"
The More Loving One,"Looking up at the stars, I know quite well
That, for all they care, I can go to hell,
But on earth indifference is the least
We have to dread from man or beast.
How should we like it were stars to burn
With a passion for us we could not return?
If equal affection cannot be,
Let the more loving one be me.
Admirer as I think I am
Of stars that do not give a damn,
I cannot, now I see them, say
I missed one terribly all day.
Were all stars to disappear or die,
I should learn to look at an empty sky
And feel its total dark sublime,
Though this might take me a little time."
Ulysses,"It little profits that an idle king,
By this still hearth, among these barren crags,
Matched with an aged wife, I mete and dole
Unequal laws unto a savage race,
That hoard, and sleep, and feed, and know not me.
I cannot rest from travel; I will drink
Life to the lees. All times I have enjoyed
Greatly, have suffered greatly, both with those
That loved me, and alone; on shore, and when
Through scudding drifts the rainy Hyades
Vext the dim sea. I am become a name;
For always roaming with a hungry heart
Much have I seen and known—cities of men
And manners, climates, councils, governments,
Myself not least, but honored of them all,—
And drunk delight of battle with my peers,
Far on the ringing plains of windy Troy.
I am a part of all that I have met;
Yet all experience is an arch wherethrough
Gleams that untraveled world whose margin fades
For ever and for ever when I move.
How dull it is to pause, to make an end,
To rust unburnished, not to shine in use!
As though to breathe were life! Life piled on life
Were all too little, and of one to me
Little remains; but every hour is saved
From that eternal silence, something more,
A bringer of new things; and vile it were
For some three suns to store and hoard myself,
And this gray spirit yearning in desire
To follow knowledge like a sinking star,
Beyond the utmost bound of human thought.
   This is my son, mine own Telemachus,
To whom I leave the scepter and the isle,
Well-loved of me, discerning to fulfill
This labor, by slow prudence to make mild
A rugged people, and through soft degrees
Subdue them to the useful and the good.
Most blameless is he, centered in the sphere
Of common duties, decent not to fail
In offices of tenderness, and pay
Meet adoration to my household gods,
When I am gone. He works his work, I mine.
   There lies the port; the vessel puffs her sail;
There gloom the dark, broad seas. My mariners,
Souls that have toiled, and wrought, and thought with me,
That ever with a frolic welcome took
The thunder and the sunshine, and opposed
Free hearts, free foreheads—you and I are old;
Old age hath yet his honor and his toil.
Death closes all; but something ere the end,
Some work of noble note, may yet be done,
Not unbecoming men that strove with gods.
The lights begin to twinkle from the rocks;
The long day wanes; the slow moon climbs; the deep
Moans round with many voices. Come, my friends,
'Tis not too late to seek a newer world.
Push off, and sitting well in order smite
The sounding furrows; for my purpose holds
To sail beyond the sunset, and the baths
Of all the western stars, until I die.
It may be that the gulfs will wash us down;
It may be we shall touch the Happy Isles,
And see the great Achilles, whom we knew.
Though much is taken, much abides; and though
We are not now that strength which in old days
Moved earth and heaven, that which we are, we are,
One equal temper of heroic hearts,
Made weak by time and fate, but strong in will
To strive, to seek, to find, and not to yield."
Archaic Torso of Apollo,"We cannot know his legendary head
with eyes like ripening fruit. And yet his torso
is still suffused with brilliance from inside,
like a lamp, in which his gaze, now turned to low,
gleams in all its power. Otherwise
the curved breast could not dazzle you so, nor could
a smile run through the placid hips and thighs
to that dark center where procreation flared.
Otherwise this stone would seem defaced
beneath the translucent cascade of the shoulders
and would not glisten like a wild beast's fur:
would not, from all the borders of itself,
burst like a star: for here there is no place
that does not see you. You must change your life."
Greensickness,"after Gwendolyn Brooks
My wild grief didn’t know where to end.
Everywhere I looked: a field alive and unburied.
Whole swaths of green swallowed the light.
All around me, the field was growing. I grew out
My hair in every direction. Let the sun freckle my face.
Even in the greenest depths, I crouched
Towards the light. That summer, everything grew
So alive and so alone. A world hushed in green.
Wildest grief grew inside out.
I crawled to the field’s edge, bruises blooming
In every crevice of my palms.
I didn’t know I’d reached a shoreline till I felt it
There: A salt wind lifted
The hair from my neck.
At the edge of every green lies an ocean.
When I saw that blue, I knew then:
This world will end.
Grief is not the only geography I know.
Every wound closes. Repair comes with sweetness,
Come spring. Every empire will fall:
I must believe this. I felt it
Somewhere in the field: my ancestors
Murmuring Go home, go home—soon, soon.
No country wants me back anymore and I’m okay.
If grief is love with nowhere to go, then
Oh, I’ve loved so immensely.
That summer, everything I touched
Was green. All bruises will fade
From green and blue to skin.
Let me grow through this green
And not drown in it.
Let me be lawless and beloved,
Ungovernable and unafraid.
Let me be brave enough to live here.
Let me be precise in my actions.
Let me feel hurt.
I know I can heal.
Let me try again—again and again."

In This Place (An American Lyric),"An original poem written for the inaugural reading of Poet Laureate Tracy K. Smith at the Library of Congress.
There’s a poem in this place—
in the footfalls in the halls
in the quiet beat of the seats.
It is here, at the curtain of day,
where America writes a lyric
you must whisper to say.
There’s a poem in this place—
in the heavy grace,
the lined face of this noble building,
collections burned and reborn twice.
There’s a poem in Boston’s Copley Square
where protest chants
tear through the air
like sheets of rain,
where love of the many
swallows hatred of the few.
There’s a poem in Charlottesville
where tiki torches string a ring of flame
tight round the wrist of night
where men so white they gleam blue—
seem like statues
where men heap that long wax burning
ever higher
where Heather Heyer
blooms forever in a meadow of resistance.
There’s a poem in the great sleeping giant
of Lake Michigan, defiantly raising
its big blue head to Milwaukee and Chicago—
a poem begun long ago, blazed into frozen soil,
strutting upward and aglow.
There’s a poem in Florida, in East Texas
where streets swell into a nexus
of rivers, cows afloat like mottled buoys in the brown,
where courage is now so common
that 23-year-old Jesus Contreras rescues people from floodwaters.
There’s a poem in Los Angeles
yawning wide as the Pacific tide
where a single mother swelters
in a windowless classroom, teaching
black and brown students in Watts
to spell out their thoughts
so her daughter might write
this poem for you.             
There's a lyric in California
where thousands of students march for blocks,
undocumented and unafraid;
where my friend Rosa finds the power to blossom
in deadlock, her spirit the bedrock of her community.
She knows hope is like a stubborn
ship gripping a dock,
a truth: that you can’t stop a dreamer
or knock down a dream.
How could this not be her city
su nación
our country
our America,
our American lyric to write—
a poem by the people, the poor,
the Protestant, the Muslim, the Jew,
the native, the immigrant,
the black, the brown, the blind, the brave,
the undocumented and undeterred,
the woman, the man, the nonbinary,
the white, the trans,
the ally to all of the above
and more?
Tyrants fear the poet.
Now that we know it
we can’t blow it.
We owe it
to show it
not slow it
although it
hurts to sew it
when the world
skirts below it.       
Hope—
we must bestow it
like a wick in the poet
so it can grow, lit,
bringing with it
stories to rewrite—
the story of a Texas city depleted but not defeated
a history written that need not be repeated
a nation composed but not yet completed.
There’s a poem in this place—
a poem in America
a poet in every American
who rewrites this nation, who tells
a story worthy of being told on this minnow of an earth
to breathe hope into a palimpsest of time—
a poet in every American
who sees that our poem penned
doesn’t mean our poem’s end.
There’s a place where this poem dwells—
it is here, it is now, in the yellow song of dawn’s bell
where we write an American lyric
we are just beginning to tell."
On Self-Knowledge,"And a man said, Speak to us of Self-Knowledge.
And he answered, saying:
Your hearts know in silence the secrets of the days and the nights.
But your ears thirst for the sound of your heart’s knowledge.
You would know in words that which you have always known in thought.
You would touch with your fingers the naked body of your dreams.
And it is well you should.
The hidden well-spring of your soul must needs rise and run murmuring to the sea;
And the treasure of your infinite depths would be revealed to your eyes.
But let there be no scales ot weigh your unknown treasure;
And seek not the depths of your knowledge with staff or sounding line.
For self is a sea boundless and measureless.
Say not, “I have found the truth,” but rather, “I have found a truth.” 
Say not, ""I have found the path of the soul.” Say rather, “I have met the soul walking upon my path.”
For the soul walks upon all paths.
The soul walks not upon a line, neither does it grow like a reed.
The soul unfolds itself, like a lotus of countless petals."
The Raincoat,"When the doctor suggested surgery
and a brace for all my youngest years,
my parents scrambled to take me
to massage therapy, deep tissue work,
osteopathy, and soon my crooked spine
unspooled a bit, I could breathe again,
and move more in a body unclouded
by pain. My mom would tell me to sing
songs to her the whole forty-five minute
drive to Middle Two Rock Road and forty-
five minutes back from physical therapy.
She’d say, even my voice sounded unfettered
by my spine afterward. So I sang and sang,
because I thought she liked it. I never
asked her what she gave up to drive me,
or how her day was before this chore. Today,
at her age, I was driving myself home from yet
another spine appointment, singing along
to some maudlin but solid song on the radio,
and I saw a mom take her raincoat off
and give it to her young daughter when
a storm took over the afternoon. My god,
I thought, my whole life I’ve been under her
raincoat thinking it was somehow a marvel
that I never got wet."
Love at First Sight,"They’re both convinced
that a sudden passion joined them.
Such certainty is beautiful,
but uncertainty is more beautiful still.
Since they’d never met before, they’re sure
that there’d been nothing between them.
But what’s the word from the streets, staircases, hallways—
perhaps they’ve passed by each other a million times?
I want to ask them
if they don’t remember—
a moment face to face
in some revolving door?
perhaps a “sorry” muttered in a crowd?
a curt “wrong number” caught in the receiver?—
but I know the answer.
No, they don’t remember.
They’d be amazed to hear
that Chance has been toying with them
now for years.
Not quite ready yet
to become their Destiny,
it pushed them close, drove them apart,
it barred their path,
stifling a laugh,
and then leaped aside.
There were signs and signals,
even if they couldn’t read them yet.
Perhaps three years ago
or just last Tuesday
a certain leaf fluttered
from one shoulder to another?
Something was dropped and then picked up.
Who knows, maybe the ball that vanished
into childhood’s thicket?
There were doorknobs and doorbells
where one touch had covered another
beforehand.
Suitcases checked and standing side by side.
One night, perhaps, the same dream,
grown hazy by morning.
Every beginning
is only a sequel, after all,
and the book of events
is always open halfway through."
The Fish,"I caught a tremendous fish
and held him beside the boat
half out of water, with my hook
fast in a corner of his mouth.
He didn't fight.
He hadn't fought at all.
He hung a grunting weight,
battered and venerable
and homely. Here and there
his brown skin hung in strips
like ancient wallpaper,
and its pattern of darker brown
was like wallpaper:
shapes like full-blown roses
stained and lost through age.
He was speckled with barnacles,
fine rosettes of lime,
and infested
with tiny white sea-lice,
and underneath two or three
rags of green weed hung down.
While his gills were breathing in
the terrible oxygen
—the frightening gills,
fresh and crisp with blood,
that can cut so badly—
I thought of the coarse white flesh
packed in like feathers,
the big bones and the little bones,
the dramatic reds and blacks
of his shiny entrails,
and the pink swim-bladder
like a big peony.
I looked into his eyes
which were far larger than mine
but shallower, and yellowed,
the irises backed and packed
with tarnished tinfoil
seen through the lenses
of old scratched isinglass.
They shifted a little, but not
to return my stare.
—It was more like the tipping
of an object toward the light.
I admired his sullen face,
the mechanism of his jaw,
and then I saw
that from his lower lip
—if you could call it a lip—
grim, wet, and weaponlike,
hung five old pieces of fish-line,
or four and a wire leader
with the swivel still attached,
with all their five big hooks
grown firmly in his mouth.
A green line, frayed at the end
where he broke it, two heavier lines,
and a fine black thread
still crimped from the strain and snap
when it broke and he got away.
Like medals with their ribbons
frayed and wavering,
a five-haired beard of wisdom
trailing from his aching jaw.
I stared and stared
and victory filled up
the little rented boat,
from the pool of bilge
where oil had spread a rainbow
around the rusted engine
to the bailer rusted orange,
the sun-cracked thwarts,
the oarlocks on their strings,
the gunnels—until everything
was rainbow, rainbow, rainbow!
And I let the fish go."
How I Am,"When I talk to my friends I pretend I am standing on the wings 

of a flying plane. I cannot be trusted to tell them how I am. 
Or if I am falling to earth weighing less 

than a dozen roses. Sometimes I dream they have broken up 

with their lovers and are carrying food to my house. 
When I open the mailbox I hear their voices 

like the long upward-winding curve of a train whistle 

passing through the tall grasses and ferns 
after the train has passed. I never get ahead of their shadows. 

I embrace them in front of moving cars. I keep them away 

from my miseries because to say I am miserable is to say I am like them. "
Dream Song 4,"Filling her compact & delicious body
with chicken páprika, she glanced at me
twice.
Fainting with interest, I hungered back
and only the fact of her husband & four other people
kept me from springing on her

or falling at her little feet and crying
'You are the hottest one for years of night
Henry's dazed eyes
have enjoyed, Brilliance.' I advanced upon
(despairing) my spumoni.—Sir Bones: is stuffed,
de world, wif feeding girls.

—Black hair, complexion Latin, jewelled eyes
downcast . . . The slob beside her     feasts . . . What wonders is
she sitting on, over there?
The restaurant buzzes.  She might as well be on Mars.
Where did it all go wrong? There ought to be a law against Henry.
—Mr. Bones: there is."
Dream Song 29,"There sat down, once, a thing on Henry's heart
só heavy, if he had a hundred years
& more, & weeping, sleepless, in all them time
Henry could not make good.
Starts again always in Henry's ears
the little cough somewhere, an odour, a chime.

And there is another thing he has in mind
like a grave Sienese face a thousand years
would fail to blur the still profiled reproach of.  Ghastly,
with open eyes, he attends, blind.
All the bells say: too late.  This is not for tears;
thinking.

But never did Henry, as he thought he did,
end anyone and hacks her body up
and hide the pieces, where they may be found.
He knows: he went over everyone, & nobody's missing.
Often he reckons, in the dawn, them up.
Nobody is ever missing."
Jabberwocky,"’Twas brillig, and the slithy toves
   Did gyre and gimble in the wabe;
All mimsy were the borogoves,
   And the mome raths outgrabe.
“Beware the Jabberwock, my son
   The jaws that bite, the claws that catch!
Beware the Jubjub bird, and shun
   The frumious Bandersnatch!”
He took his vorpal sword in hand;
   Long time the manxome foe he sought—
So rested he by the Tumtum tree,
   And stood awhile in thought.
And, as in uffish thought he stood,
   The Jabberwock, with eyes of flame,
Came whiffling through the tulgey wood,
   And burbled as it came!
One, two! One, two! And through and through
   The vorpal blade went snicker-snack!
He left it dead, and with its head
   He went galumphing back.
“And hast thou slain the Jabberwock?
   Come to my arms, my beamish boy!
O frabjous day! Callooh! Callay!”
   He chortled in his joy.
’Twas brillig, and the slithy toves
   Did gyre and gimble in the wabe;
All mimsy were the borogoves,
   And the mome raths outgrabe."
"In Memoriam, [Ring out, wild bells]","Ring out, wild bells, to the wild sky,
   The flying cloud, the frosty light:
   The year is dying in the night;
Ring out, wild bells, and let him die.
Ring out the old, ring in the new,
   Ring, happy bells, across the snow:
   The year is going, let him go;
Ring out the false, ring in the true.
Ring out the grief that saps the mind
   For those that here we see no more;
   Ring out the feud of rich and poor,
Ring in redress to all mankind.
Ring out a slowly dying cause,
   And ancient forms of party strife;
   Ring in the nobler modes of life,
With sweeter manners, purer laws.
Ring out the want, the care, the sin,
   The faithless coldness of the times;
   Ring out, ring out my mournful rhymes
But ring the fuller minstrel in.
Ring out false pride in place and blood,
   The civic slander and the spite;
   Ring in the love of truth and right,
Ring in the common love of good.
Ring out old shapes of foul disease;
   Ring out the narrowing lust of gold;
   Ring out the thousand wars of old,
Ring in the thousand years of peace.
Ring in the valiant man and free,
   The larger heart, the kindlier hand;
   Ring out the darkness of the land,
Ring in the Christ that is to be."
Mother to Son,"Well, son, I’ll tell you: 
Life for me ain’t been no crystal stair.
It’s had tacks in it,
And splinters,
And boards torn up,
And places with no carpet on the floor—
Bare;
But all the time
I’se been a’climbin’ on,
And reachin’ landin’s,
And turnin’ corners, 
And sometimes goin’ in the dark, 
Where there ain’t been no light.
So boy, don’t you turn back;
Don’t you sit down on the steps, 
’Cause you finds it’s kinder hard;
Don’t you fall now—
For I’se still goin’, honey,
I’se still climbin’,
And life for me ain’t been no crystal stair."
The Index,"In the beginning there was darkness,
then a bunch of other stuff—and lots of people.
Some things were said and loosely interpreted,
or maybe things were not communicated clearly.
Regardless—there has always been an index.
That thing about the meek—how we
shall inherit the earth; that was a promise
made in a treaty at the dawn of time
agreed upon in primordial darkness                
and documented in the spiritual record.
The nature of the agreement was thus:
The world will seemingly be pushed past capacity.
A new planet will be “discovered” 31 light-years away.   
Space travel will advance rapidly,
making the journey feasible. The ice sheets will melt.
Things will get ugly. The only way to leave
will be to buy a ticket. Tickets will be priced at exactly
the amount that can be accrued
by abandoning basic humanity.
The index will show how you came by your fortune:            
If you murdered, trafficked or exploited the vulnerable,
stole, embezzled, poisoned, cheated, swindled,
or otherwise subdued nature to come by wealth
great enough to afford passage to the new earth;
if your ancestors did these things and you’ve done nothing
to benefit from their crimes yet do nothing to atone
through returning inherited wealth to the greater good
you shall be granted passage. It was agreed.
The meek shall stay, the powerful shall leave.
And it all shall start again.
The meek shall inherit the earth,
and what shall we do with it,
but set about putting aside our meekness?"
On Children,"And a woman who held a babe against her bosom said, Speak to us of Children.
     And he said:
     Your children are not your children.
     They are the sons and daughters of Life’s longing for itself.
     They come through you but not from you,
     And though they are with you yet they belong not to you.
     You may give them your love but not your thoughts,
     For they have their own thoughts.
     You may house their bodies but not their souls,
     For their souls dwell in the house of tomorrow, which you cannot visit, not even in your dreams.
     You may strive to be like them, but seek not to make them like you.
     For life goes not backward nor tarries with yesterday.
     You are the bows from which your children as living arrows are sent forth.
     The archer sees the mark upon the path of the infinite, and He bends you with His might that His arrows may go swift and far.
     Let your bending in the archer’s hand be for gladness;
     For even as He loves the arrow that flies, so He loves also the bow that is stable."
Moonlily,"(Mather AFB, California, 1956)

When we play horses at recess, my name
is Moonlily and I’m a yearling mare.
We gallop circles around the playground,
whinnying, neighing, and shaking our manes.
We scrape the ground with scuffed saddle oxfords,
thunder around the little kids on swings
and seesaws, and around the boys’ ball games.
We’re sorrel, chestnut, buckskin, pinto, gray,
a herd in pastel dresses and white socks.
We’re self-named, untamed, untouched, unridden.
Our plains know no fences. We can smell spring.
The bell produces metamorphosis.
Still hot and flushed, we file back to our desks,
one bay in a room of palominos."
A Small Needful Fact,"Is that Eric Garner worked
for some time for the Parks and Rec.
Horticultural Department, which means,
perhaps, that with his very large hands,
perhaps, in all likelihood,
he put gently into the earth
some plants which, most likely,
some of them, in all likelihood,
continue to grow, continue
to do what such plants do, like house
and feed small and necessary creatures,
like being pleasant to touch and smell,
like converting sunlight
into food, like making it easier
for us to breathe."
So Much Happiness,"It is difficult to know what to do with so much happiness.
With sadness there is something to rub against,
a wound to tend with lotion and cloth.
When the world falls in around you, you have pieces to pick up,
something to hold in your hands, like ticket stubs or change.
But happiness floats.
It doesn’t need you to hold it down.
It doesn’t need anything.
Happiness lands on the roof of the next house, singing,
and disappears when it wants to.
You are happy either way.
Even the fact that you once lived in a peaceful tree house
and now live over a quarry of noise and dust
cannot make you unhappy.
Everything has a life of its own,
it too could wake up filled with possibilities
of coffee cake and ripe peaches,
and love even the floor which needs to be swept,
the soiled linens and scratched records . . .
Since there is no place large enough
to contain so much happiness,
you shrug, you raise your hands, and it flows out of you
into everything you touch. You are not responsible.
You take no credit, as the night sky takes no credit
for the moon, but continues to hold it, and share it,
and in that way, be known."
The Power of the Dog,"There is sorrow enough in the natural way
From men and women to fill our day;
And when we are certain of sorrow in store,
Why do we always arrange for more?
Brothers and Sisters, I bid you beware
Of giving your heart to a dog to tear.
Buy a pup and your money will buy
Love unflinching that cannot lie—
Perfect passion and worship fed
By a kick in the ribs or a pat on the head.
Nevertheless it is hardly fair
To risk your heart for a dog to tear.
When the fourteen years which Nature permits
Are closing in asthma, or tumour, or fits,
And the vet’s unspoken prescription runs
To lethal chambers or loaded guns,
Then you will find—it’s your own affair—
But… you’ve given your heart to a dog to tear.
When the body that lived at your single will,
With its whimper of welcome, is stilled (how still!).
When the spirit that answered your every mood
Is gone—wherever it goes—for good,
You will discover how much you care,
And will give your heart to a dog to tear.
We’ve sorrow enough in the natural way,
When it comes to burying Christian clay.
Our loves are not given, but only lent,
At compound interest of cent per cent.
Though it is not always the case, I believe,
That the longer we’ve kept ’em, the more do we grieve:
For, when debts are payable, right or wrong,
A short-time loan is as bad as a long—
So why in—Heaven (before we are there)
Should we give our hearts to a dog to tear?"
Kindness,"Before you know what kindness really is
you must lose things,
feel the future dissolve in a moment
like salt in a weakened broth.
What you held in your hand,
what you counted and carefully saved,
all this must go so you know
how desolate the landscape can be
between the regions of kindness.
How you ride and ride
thinking the bus will never stop,
the passengers eating maize and chicken
will stare out the window forever.
Before you learn the tender gravity of kindness
you must travel where the Indian in a white poncho
lies dead by the side of the road.
You must see how this could be you,
how he too was someone
who journeyed through the night with plans
and the simple breath that kept him alive.
Before you know kindness as the deepest thing inside,
you must know sorrow as the other deepest thing.
You must wake up with sorrow.
You must speak to it till your voice
catches the thread of all sorrows
and you see the size of the cloth.
Then it is only kindness that makes sense anymore,
only kindness that ties your shoes
and sends you out into the day to gaze at bread,
only kindness that raises its head
from the crowd of the world to say
It is I you have been looking for,
and then goes with you everywhere
like a shadow or a friend."

"Hamlet, Act III, Scene I [To be, or not to be]","To be, or not to be: that is the question:
Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer
The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune,
Or to take arms against a sea of troubles,
And by opposing end them? To die: to sleep;
No more; and by a sleep to say we end
The heart-ache and the thousand natural shocks
That flesh is heir to, 'tis a consummation
Devoutly to be wish'd. To die, to sleep;
To sleep: perchance to dream: ay, there's the rub;
For in that sleep of death what dreams may come
When we have shuffled off this mortal coil,
Must give us pause: there's the respect
That makes calamity of so long life;
For who would bear the whips and scorns of time,
The oppressor's wrong, the proud man's contumely,
The pangs of despised love, the law's delay,
The insolence of office and the spurns
That patient merit of the unworthy takes,
When he himself might his quietus make
With a bare bodkin? who would fardels bear,
To grunt and sweat under a weary life,
But that the dread of something after death,
The undiscover'd country from whose bourn
No traveller returns, puzzles the will
And makes us rather bear those ills we have
Than fly to others that we know not of?
Thus conscience does make cowards of us all;
And thus the native hue of resolution
Is sicklied o'er with the pale cast of thought,
And enterprises of great pith and moment
With this regard their currents turn awry,
And lose the name of action.—Soft you now!
The fair Ophelia! Nymph, in thy orisons
Be all my sins remember'd."
Invictus,"Out of the night that covers me,   
  Black as the Pit from pole to pole,   
I thank whatever gods may be   
  For my unconquerable soul.   
In the fell clutch of circumstance 
  I have not winced nor cried aloud.   
Under the bludgeonings of chance   
  My head is bloody, but unbowed.   
Beyond this place of wrath and tears   
  Looms but the Horror of the shade, 
And yet the menace of the years   
  Finds, and shall find, me unafraid.   
It matters not how strait the gate,   
  How charged with punishments the scroll,   
I am the master of my fate:
  I am the captain of my soul."
O Me! O Life!,"O Me! O life! of the questions of these recurring,
Of the endless trains of the faithless, of cities fill’d with the foolish,
Of myself forever reproaching myself, (for who more foolish than I, and who more faithless?)
Of eyes that vainly crave the light, of the objects mean, of the struggle ever renew’d,
Of the poor results of all, of the plodding and sordid crowds I see around me,
Of the empty and useless years of the rest, with the rest me intertwined,
The question, O me! so sad, recurring—What good amid these, O me, O life?

Answer.
That you are here—that life exists and identity,
That the powerful play goes on, and you may contribute a verse."
"Twelfth Night, Act II, Scene III [O Mistress mine, where are you roaming?]","The Clown, singing

O Mistress mine, where are you roaming?  
O stay and hear! your true-love’s coming  
That can sing both high and low;  
Trip no further, pretty sweeting,  
Journeys end in lovers’ meeting—          
Every wise man’s son doth know.  
  
What is love? ’tis not hereafter;  
Present mirth hath present laughter;  
What’s to come is still unsure:  
In delay there lies no plenty,—          
Then come kiss me, Sweet-and-twenty,  
Youth’s a stuff will not endure."
Leaves,"                        1 

Every October it becomes important, no, necessary
to see the leaves turning, to be surrounded
by leaves turning; it's not just the symbolism,
to confront in the death of the year your death,
one blazing farewell appearance, though the irony 
isn't lost on you that nature is most seductive
when it's about to die, flaunting the dazzle of its 
incipient exit, an ending that at least so far 
the effects of human progress (pollution, acid rain)
have not yet frightened you enough to make you believe
is real; that is, you know this ending is a deception
because of course nature is always renewing itself—
        the trees don't die, they just pretend,
        go out in style, and return in style: a new style.





                        2 

Is it deliberate how far they make you go
especially if you live in the city to get far 
enough away from home to see not just trees 
but only trees? The boring highways, roadsigns, high 
speeds, 10-axle trucks passing you as if they were 
in an even greater hurry than you to look at leaves:
so you drive in terror for literal hours and it looks 
like rain, or snow, but it's probably just clouds
(too cloudy to see any color?) and you wonder, 
given the poverty of your memory, which road had the 
most color last year, but it doesn't matter since 
you're probably too late anyway, or too early—
        whichever road you take will be the wrong one
        and you've probably come all this way for nothing.






                        3 

You'll be driving along depressed when suddenly
a cloud will move and the sun will muscle through
and ignite the hills. It may not last. Probably
won't last. But for a moment the whole world
comes to. Wakes up. Proves it lives. It lives—
red, yellow, orange, brown, russet, ocher, vermilion,
gold. Flame and rust. Flame and rust, the permutations
of burning. You're on fire. Your eyes are on fire.
It won't last, you don't want it to last. You 
can't stand any more. But you don't want it to stop. 
It's what you've come for. It's what you'll
come back for. It won't stay with you, but you'll 
        remember that it felt like nothing else you've felt
        or something you've felt that also didn't last."
The Swing,"How do you like to go up in a swing, 
             Up in the air so blue? 
Oh, I do think it the pleasantest thing 
             Ever a child can do! 

Up in the air and over the wall, 
             Till I can see so wide, 
River and trees and cattle and all 
             Over the countryside—

Till I look down on the garden green, 
              Down on the roof so brown—
Up in the air I go flying again, 
              Up in the air and down!"
Nothing Gold Can Stay,"Nature’s first green is gold,
Her hardest hue to hold.
Her early leaf’s a flower;
But only so an hour.
Then leaf subsides to leaf.
So Eden sank to grief,
So dawn goes down to day.
Nothing gold can stay."
In Flanders Fields,"In Flanders fields the poppies blow
Between the crosses, row on row,
    That mark our place; and in the sky
    The larks, still bravely singing, fly
Scarce heard amid the guns below.
We are the Dead. Short days ago
We lived, felt dawn, saw sunset glow,
    Loved and were loved, and now we lie
        In Flanders fields.
Take up our quarrel with the foe: 
To you from failing hands we throw
    The torch; be yours to hold it high. 
    If ye break faith with us who die
We shall not sleep, though poppies grow
        In Flanders fields."
I Hear an Army,"I hear an army charging upon the land,   
  And the thunder of horses plunging, foam about their knees:   
Arrogant, in black armour, behind them stand,   
  Disdaining the reins, with fluttering whips, the charioteers.   
   
They cry unto the night their battle-name:        
  I moan in sleep when I hear afar their whirling laughter.   
They cleave the gloom of dreams, a blinding flame,   
  Clanging, clanging upon the heart as upon an anvil.   
   
They come shaking in triumph their long, green hair:   
  They come out of the sea and run shouting by the shore. 
My heart, have you no wisdom thus to despair?   
  My love, my love, my love, why have you left me alone?"
"Wynken, Blynken, and Nod","Wynken, Blynken, and Nod one night
   Sailed off in a wooden shoe,—
Sailed on a river of crystal light
   Into a sea of dew.
""Where are you going, and what do you wish?""
   The old moon asked the three.
""We have come to fish for the herring-fish
   That live in this beautiful sea;
   Nets of silver and gold have we,""
            Said Wynken,
            Blynken,
            And Nod.
The old moon laughed and sang a song,
   As they rocked in the wooden shoe;
And the wind that sped them all night long
   Ruffled the waves of dew;
The little stars were the herring-fish
   That lived in the beautiful sea.
""Now cast your nets wherever you wish,—
   Never afraid are we!""
   So cried the stars to the fishermen three,
            Wynken,
            Blynken,
            And Nod.
All night long their nets they threw
   To the stars in the twinkling foam,—
Then down from the skies came the wooden shoe,
   Bringing the fishermen home:
'Twas all so pretty a sail, it seemed
   As if it could not be;
And some folk thought 'twas a dream they'd dreamed
   Of sailing that beautiful sea;
   But I shall name you the fishermen three:
            Wynken,
            Blynken,
            And Nod.
Wynken and Blynken are two little eyes,
   And Nod is a little head,
And the wooden shoe that sailed the skies
   Is a wee one's trundle-bed;
So shut your eyes while Mother sings
   Of wonderful sights that be,
And you shall see the beautiful things
   As you rock in the misty sea
   Where the old shoe rocked the fishermen three:—
            Wynken,
            Blynken,
            And Nod."

Be Glad Your Nose Is on Your Face,"Be glad your nose is on your face,
not pasted on some other place,
for if it were where it is not,
you might dislike your nose a lot.
Imagine if your precious nose
were sandwiched in between your toes,
that clearly would not be a treat,
for you’d be forced to smell your feet.
Your nose would be a source of dread
were it attached atop your head,
it soon would drive you to despair,
forever tickled by your hair.
Within your ear, your nose would be
an absolute catastrophe,
for when you were obliged to sneeze,
your brain would rattle from the breeze.
Your nose, instead, through thick and thin,
remains between your eyes and chin,
not pasted on some other place—
be glad your nose is on your face!"
At Pegasus,"They are like those crazy women 
   who tore Orpheus
      when he refused to sing,

these men grinding
   in the strobe & black lights
      of Pegasus. All shadow & sound.

""I'm just here for the music,"" 
   I tell the man who asks me
      to the floor. But I have held

a boy on my back before.
   Curtis & I used to leap
      barefoot into the creek; dance

among maggots & piss,
   beer bottles & tadpoles
      slippery as sperm;

we used to pull off our shirts, 
   & slap music into our skin.
      He wouldn't know me now
   
at the edge of these lovers' gyre, 
   glitter & steam, fire,
      bodies blurred sexless

by the music's spinning light.
   A young man slips his thumb
      into the mouth of an old one,

& I am not that far away.
   The whole scene raw & delicate 
      as Curtis's foot gashed

on a sunken bottle shard. 
   They press hip to hip,
      each breathless as a boy

carrying a friend on his back. 
   The foot swelling green
      as the sewage in that creek.

We never went back.
   But I remember his weight 
      better than I remember

my first kiss.
   These men know something
      I used to know.

How could I not find them
   beautiful, the way they dive & spill 
      into each other,

the way the dance floor
   takes them,
      wet & holy in its mouth."
Still I Rise,"You may write me down in history
With your bitter, twisted lies,
You may trod me in the very dirt
But still, like dust, I’ll rise.
Does my sassiness upset you?
Why are you beset with gloom?
’Cause I walk like I’ve got oil wells
Pumping in my living room.
Just like moons and like suns,
With the certainty of tides,
Just like hopes springing high,
Still I’ll rise.
Did you want to see me broken?
Bowed head and lowered eyes?
Shoulders falling down like teardrops,
Weakened by my soulful cries?
Does my haughtiness offend you?
Don’t you take it awful hard
’Cause I laugh like I’ve got gold mines
Diggin’ in my own backyard.
You may shoot me with your words,
You may cut me with your eyes,
You may kill me with your hatefulness,
But still, like air, I’ll rise.
Does my sexiness upset you?
Does it come as a surprise
That I dance like I’ve got diamonds
At the meeting of my thighs?
Out of the huts of history’s shame
I rise
Up from a past that’s rooted in pain
I rise
I’m a black ocean, leaping and wide,
Welling and swelling I bear in the tide.
Leaving behind nights of terror and fear
I rise
Into a daybreak that’s wondrously clear
I rise
Bringing the gifts that my ancestors gave,
I am the dream and the hope of the slave.
I rise
I rise
I rise."
The New Colossus,"Not like the brazen giant of Greek fame,
With conquering limbs astride from land to land;
Here at our sea-washed, sunset gates shall stand
A mighty woman with a torch, whose flame
Is the imprisoned lightning, and her name
Mother of Exiles. From her beacon-hand
Glows world-wide welcome; her mild eyes command
The air-bridged harbor that twin cities frame.
“Keep, ancient lands, your storied pomp!” cries she
With silent lips. “Give me your tired, your poor,
Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free,
The wretched refuse of your teeming shore.
Send these, the homeless, tempest-tost to me,
I lift my lamp beside the golden door!”"
Let America Be America Again,"Let America be America again.
Let it be the dream it used to be.
Let it be the pioneer on the plain
Seeking a home where he himself is free.
(America never was America to me.)
Let America be the dream the dreamers dreamed—
Let it be that great strong land of love
Where never kings connive nor tyrants scheme
That any man be crushed by one above.
(It never was America to me.)
O, let my land be a land where Liberty
Is crowned with no false patriotic wreath,
But opportunity is real, and life is free,
Equality is in the air we breathe.
(There’s never been equality for me,
Nor freedom in this “homeland of the free.”)
Say, who are you that mumbles in the dark?
And who are you that draws your veil across the stars?
I am the poor white, fooled and pushed apart,
I am the Negro bearing slavery’s scars.
I am the red man driven from the land,
I am the immigrant clutching the hope I seek—
And finding only the same old stupid plan
Of dog eat dog, of mighty crush the weak.
I am the young man, full of strength and hope,
Tangled in that ancient endless chain
Of profit, power, gain, of grab the land!
Of grab the gold! Of grab the ways of satisfying need!
Of work the men! Of take the pay!
Of owning everything for one’s own greed!
I am the farmer, bondsman to the soil.
I am the worker sold to the machine.
I am the Negro, servant to you all.
I am the people, humble, hungry, mean—
Hungry yet today despite the dream.
Beaten yet today—O, Pioneers!
I am the man who never got ahead,
The poorest worker bartered through the years.
Yet I’m the one who dreamt our basic dream
In the Old World while still a serf of kings,
Who dreamt a dream so strong, so brave, so true,
That even yet its mighty daring sings
In every brick and stone, in every furrow turned
That’s made America the land it has become.
O, I’m the man who sailed those early seas
In search of what I meant to be my home—
For I’m the one who left dark Ireland’s shore,
And Poland’s plain, and England’s grassy lea,
And torn from Black Africa’s strand I came
To build a “homeland of the free.”
The free?
Who said the free? Not me?
Surely not me? The millions on relief today?
The millions shot down when we strike?
The millions who have nothing for our pay?
For all the dreams we’ve dreamed
And all the songs we’ve sung
And all the hopes we’ve held
And all the flags we’ve hung,
The millions who have nothing for our pay—
Except the dream that’s almost dead today.
O, let America be America again—
The land that never has been yet—
And yet must be—the land where every man is free.
The land that’s mine—the poor man’s, Indian’s, Negro’s, ME—
Who made America,
Whose sweat and blood, whose faith and pain,
Whose hand at the foundry, whose plow in the rain,
Must bring back our mighty dream again.
Sure, call me any ugly name you choose—
The steel of freedom does not stain.
From those who live like leeches on the people’s lives,
We must take back our land again,
America!
O, yes,
I say it plain,
America never was America to me,
And yet I swear this oath—
America will be!
Out of the rack and ruin of our gangster death,
The rape and rot of graft, and stealth, and lies,
We, the people, must redeem
The land, the mines, the plants, the rivers.
The mountains and the endless plain—
All, all the stretch of these great green states—
And make America again!"
Ode on Intimations of Immortality from Recollections of Early Childhood,"There was a time when meadow, grove, and stream,
The earth, and every common sight
                 To me did seem
            Apparelled in celestial light,
The glory and the freshness of a dream.
It is not now as it hath been of yore;—
             Turn wheresoe’er I may,
              By night or day,
The things which I have seen I now can see no more.
            The rainbow comes and goes,
            And lovely is the rose;
            The moon doth with delight
     Look round her when the heavens are bare;
            Waters on a starry night
            Are beautiful and fair;
     The sunshine is a glorious birth;
     But yet I know, where’er I go,
That there hath past away a glory from the earth.
Now, while the birds thus sing a joyous song,
     And while the young lambs bound
            As to the tabor’s sound,
To me alone there came a thought of grief:
A timely utterance gave that thought relief,
            And I again am strong.
The cataracts blow their trumpets from the steep,—
No more shall grief of mine the season wrong:
I hear the echoes through the mountains throng.
The winds come to me from the fields of sleep,
            And all the earth is gay;
                Land and sea
     Give themselves up to jollity,
            And with the heart of May
     Doth every beast keep holiday;—
                Thou child of joy,
Shout round me, let me hear thy shouts, thou happy
        Shepherd-boy!
                 Ye blesséd Creatures, I have heard the call 
     Ye to each other make; I see
The heavens laugh with you in your jubilee;
     My heart is at your festival,
       My head hath its coronal,
The fulness of your bliss, I feel—I feel it all.
         O evil day! if I were sullen
         While Earth herself is adorning
              This sweet May-morning;
         And the children are culling
              On every side
         In a thousand valleys far and wide
         Fresh flowers; while the sun shines warm,
And the babe leaps up on his mother’s arm:—
         I hear, I hear, with joy I hear!
         —But there’s a tree, of many, one,
A single field which I have look’d upon,
Both of them speak of something that is gone:
              The pansy at my feet
              Doth the same tale repeat:
Whither is fled the visionary gleam?
Where is it now, the glory and the dream?
Our birth is but a sleep and a forgetting;
The Soul that rises with us, our life’s Star,
          Hath had elsewhere its setting
               And cometh from afar;
          Not in entire forgetfulness,
          And not in utter nakedness,
But trailing clouds of glory do we come 
               From God, who is our home:
Heaven lies about us in our infancy!
Shades of the prison-house begin to close
               Upon the growing Boy,
But he beholds the light, and whence it flows,
               He sees it in his joy;
The Youth, who daily farther from the east
     Must travel, still is Nature’s priest,
          And by the vision splendid
          Is on his way attended;
At length the Man perceives it die away,
And fade into the light of common day.
Earth fills her lap with pleasures of her own;
Yearnings she hath in her own natural kind,
And, even with something of a mother‘s mind,
               And no unworthy aim,
          The homely nurse doth all she can
To make her foster-child, her inmate, Man,
               Forget the glories he hath known,
And that imperial palace whence he came.
Behold the Child among his new-born blisses,
A six years’ darling of a pigmy size!
See, where ‘mid work of his own hand he lies,
Fretted by sallies of his mother’s kisses,
With light upon him from his father’s eyes!
See, at his feet, some little plan or chart,
Some fragment from his dream of human life,
Shaped by himself with newly-learned art;
          A wedding or a festival,
          A mourning or a funeral;
               And this hath now his heart,
          And unto this he frames his song:
               Then will he fit his tongue
To dialogues of business, love, or strife;
          But it will not be long
          Ere this be thrown aside,
          And with new joy and pride
The little actor cons another part;
Filling from time to time his ‘humorous stage’
With all the Persons, down to palsied Age,
That life brings with her in her equipage;
          As if his whole vocation
          Were endless imitation.
Thou, whose exterior semblance doth belie
          Thy soul’s immensity;
Thou best philosopher, who yet dost keep
Thy heritage, thou eye among the blind,
That, deaf and silent, read’st the eternal deep,
Haunted for ever by the eternal Mind,—
          Mighty Prophet! Seer blest!
          On whom those truths rest
Which we are toiling all our lives to find,
In darkness lost, the darkness of the grave;
Thou, over whom thy Immortality
Broods like the day, a master o’er a slave,
A Presence which is not to be put by;
          To whom the grave
Is but a lonely bed, without the sense of sight
Of day or the warm light,
A place of thoughts where we in waiting lie;
Thou little child, yet glorious in the might
Of heaven-born freedom on thy being’s height,
Why with such earnest pains dost thou provoke
The years to bring the inevitable yoke,
Thus blindly with thy blessedness at strife?
Full soon thy soul shall have her earthly freight,
And custom lie upon thee with a weight
Heavy as frost, and deep almost as life!
          O joy! that in our embers
          Is something that doth live,
          That Nature yet remembers
          What was so fugitive!
The thought of our past years in me doth breed
Perpetual benediction: not indeed
For that which is most worthy to be blest,
Delight and liberty, the simple creed
Of Childhood, whether busy or at rest,
With new-fledged hope still fluttering in his breast:—
          —Not for these I raise
          The song of thanks and praise;
     But for those obstinate questionings
     Of sense and outward things,
     Fallings from us, vanishings,
     Blank misgivings of a creature
Moving about in worlds not realized, 
High instincts, before which our mortal nature 
Did tremble like a guilty thing surprised:
     But for those first affections,
     Those shadowy recollections,
          Which, be they what they may,
Are yet the fountain-light of all our day,
Are yet a master-light of all our seeing;
     Uphold us—cherish—and have power to make
Our noisy years seem moments in the being 
Of the eternal Silence: truths that wake,
               To perish never;
Which neither listlessness, nor mad endeavour,
               Nor man nor boy,
Nor all that is at enmity with joy,
Can utterly abolish or destroy!
   Hence, in a season of calm weather
          Though inland far we be,
Our souls have sight of that immortal sea
               Which brought us hither;
          Can in a moment travel thither—
And see the children sport upon the shore,
And hear the mighty waters rolling evermore.
Then, sing, ye birds, sing, sing a joyous song!
          And let the young lambs bound
          As to the tabor’s sound!
     We, in thought, will join your throng,
          Ye that pipe and ye that play,
          Ye that through your hearts to-day
          Feel the gladness of the May!
What though the radiance which was once so bright
Be now for ever taken from my sight,
     Though nothing can bring back the hour
Of splendour in the grass, of glory in the flower;
          We will grieve not, rather find
          Strength in what remains behind;
          In the primal sympathy
          Which having been must ever be;
          In the soothing thoughts that spring
          Out of human suffering;
          In the faith that looks through death,
In years that bring the philosophic mind.
And O, ye Fountains, Meadows, Hills, and Groves,
Forebode not any severing of our loves!
Yet in my heart of hearts I feel your might;
I only have relinquish‘d one delight
To live beneath your more habitual sway;
I love the brooks which down their channels fret
Even more than when I tripp’d lightly as they;
The innocent brightness of a new-born day
               Is lovely yet;
The clouds that gather round the setting sun
Do take a sober colouring from an eye
That hath kept watch o’er man’s mortality;
Another race hath been, and other palms are won.
   Thanks to the human heart by which we live,
   Thanks to its tenderness, its joys, and fears,
   To me the meanest flower that blows can give
   Thoughts that do often lie too deep for tears."
Notes from the Other Side,"I divested myself of despair
and fear when I came here.

Now there is no more catching
one's own eye in the mirror,

there are no bad books, no plastic,
no insurance premiums, and of course

no illness. Contrition 
does not exist, nor gnashing

of teeth. No one howls as the first
clod of earth hits the casket.

The poor we no longer have with us. 
Our calm hearts strike only the hour,

and God, as promised, proves
to be mercy clothed in light."
The Splendid Body,"The splendid body is meat, flexor
and flesh pumping, pulling, anti-
gravity maverick just standing
upright all over museums and
in line for the bus and in the laundry
aisle where it’s just standing there
smelling all the detergent like
it’s no big deal. So what if a couple
of its squishy parts are suspended
within, like beach-bungled jellyfish
in a shelved jar, not doing anything?
Nothing on this side of the quantum
tunnel is perfect. The splendid body,
though, is splendid in the way
it keeps its steamy blood in, no matter
how bad it blushes. And splendid
in how it opens its mouth and
these invisible vibrations come
rippling out—if you put your wrist
right up to it when that happens
it feels somewhat like the feet
of many bees. The splendid body
loves the juniper smell of gin, loves
the warmth of printer-fresh paper,
and the sound fallen leaves make
under the wheel of a turning car.
If you touch it between the legs,
the splendid body will quicken
like bubbles in a just-on teakettle.
It knows it can’t exist forever, so
it’s collecting as many flavors as it can—
saffron, rainwater, fish-skin, chive.
Do not distract it from its purpose,
which is to feel everything it can find."
Dream Nest,"More like a basket
            of twig and hair, 
            surprisingly 
            tall
           
            and deep—
                        in a tree
            outside my bedroom
            window.
I knew 
            something lived in there
            you wouldn’t assume
                        lived in a nest.
Then I knew:
            a human lived there.
And once I knew—
            the nest, nearly 
           
            disintegrated, 
                           still in the tree. 
                                   
It wasn’t about trauma, the perfect 
            and then the broken 
                        nest 
            in which a human 
                        lived—
            Born and lit and broken
                                     comes I."
Chickens,"I come from hay and barns, raising 
chickens. In spring, lambs come. 
You got to get up, fly early, do the orphan run 
sleep till dawn, start the feeding. 
When the electricity shuts off, you boil water, you crack ice. 
You keep the animals watered. 
You walk through the barn, through the hay smell,
your hair brittle where you chopped it with scissors 
same ones you use for everything. Your sweater has holes. 
When you feed the ram lambs, you say goodbye. 
Summer, choke cherries; your mouth’s dry. Apples, cider. 
Corn picking. Canning for weeks that feel like years. 
Chopping heads off quail, rabbits, chickens. 
You can pluck a chicken, gut it fast. 
You find unformed eggs, unformed chicks. 
They start chirping day nineteen. 
You make biscuits and gravy for hundred kids 
serve them up good. You’re the chick 
who never got past day nineteen, never found your chick voice. 
You make iced tea. They say, you’re a soldier in the king’s army. 
At night, you say to yourself, Kathy, someday. 
We go walking. We go talking. We find a big story. 
A cracking egg story. A walking girl story. 
A walking out of the woods story. A not slapped silly story. 
A not Jesus story. Hush, Kathy you say, we get out of here. 
We find out where chicks go when they learn to fly."
[since feeling is first],"since feeling is first
who pays any attention 
to the syntax of things
will never wholly kiss you;
wholly to be a fool
while Spring is in the world
my blood approves,
and kisses are a better fate 
than wisdom
lady i swear by all flowers. Don’t cry
—the best gesture of my brain is less than
your eyelids’ flutter which says
we are for each other: then
laugh, leaning back in my arms
for life’s not a paragraph
And death i think is no parenthesis"
Poem,"(To F. S.)
I loved my friend. 
He went away from me. 
There’s nothing more to say. 
The poem ends, 
Soft as it began,—
I loved my friend. "
Wasteland: on the California Wildfires,"Green spring grass on
                     the hills had cured
                              by June and by July
                                                                              gone wooly and
                                                                brown, it crackled
                                            underfoot, desiccated while
    within the clamor of live
                    oaks, an infestation of
                                          tiny larvae clung
                                                                            to the underleaves,
                                                             feeding between
                                         veins. Their frass, that
    fine dandruff of excrement
                    and boring dust, tinkled
                                       as it dropped onto dead leaves
                                                                        below the limbs. You
                                                          could hear it twenty
                                                  feet away, tinkling.
    Across the valley, on
                     Sugarloaf Ridge, the full
                                       moon showed up
                                                               like a girl doing cartwheels.
                                                  No one goes on living
                                       the life that isn’t there.
    Below a vast column of
                      smoke, heat, flame, and
                                  wind, I rose, swaying
                                                                  and tottering on my
                                                    erratic vortex, extemporizing
                               my own extreme weather, sucking up
    acres of scorched
           topsoil and spinning it
                                outward in a burning sleet
                                                                    of filth and embers that
                                           catapulted me forward
                                 with my mouth open
    in every direction at once. So
                     I came for you, churning, turning
                                         the present into purgatory
                                                                    because I need to turn
                                           everything to tragedy before
                                I can see it, because
    it must be
           leavened with remorse
                      for the feeling to rise."
Macavity: The Mystery Cat,"Macavity’s a Mystery Cat: he’s called the Hidden Paw—
For he’s the master criminal who can defy the Law.
He’s the bafflement of Scotland Yard, the Flying Squad’s despair:
For when they reach the scene of crime—Macavity’s not there!
Macavity, Macavity, there’s no one like Macavity,
He’s broken every human law, he breaks the law of gravity.
His powers of levitation would make a fakir stare,
And when you reach the scene of crime—Macavity’s not there!
You may seek him in the basement, you may look up in the air—
But I tell you once and once again, Macavity’s not there!
Macavity’s a ginger cat, he’s very tall and thin;
You would know him if you saw him, for his eyes are sunken in.
His brow is deeply lined with thought, his head is highly domed;
His coat is dusty from neglect, his whiskers are uncombed.
He sways his head from side to side, with movements like a snake;
And when you think he’s half asleep, he’s always wide awake.
Macavity, Macavity, there’s no one like Macavity,
For he’s a fiend in feline shape, a monster of depravity.
You may meet him in a by-street, you may see him in the square—
But when a crime’s discovered, then Macavity’s not there!
He’s outwardly respectable. (They say he cheats at cards.)
And his footprints are not found in any file of Scotland Yard’s.
And when the larder’s looted, or the jewel-case is rifled,
Or when the milk is missing, or another Peke’s been stifled,
Or the greenhouse glass is broken, and the trellis past repair—
Ay, there’s the wonder of the thing! Macavity’s not there!
And when the Foreign Office find a Treaty’s gone astray,
Or the Admiralty lose some plans and drawings by the way,
There may be a scrap of paper in the hall or on the stair—
But it’s useless to investigate—Macavity’s not there!
And when the loss has been disclosed, the Secret Service say:
‘It must have been Macavity!’—but he’s a mile away.
You’ll be sure to find him resting, or a-licking of his thumbs;
Or engaged in doing complicated long division sums.
Macavity, Macavity, there’s no one like Macavity,
There never was a Cat of such deceitfulness and suavity.
He always has an alibi, and one or two to spare:
At whatever time the deed took place—MACAVITY WASN’T THERE!
And they say that all the Cats whose wicked deeds are widely known
(I might mention Mungojerrie, I might mention Griddlebone)
Are nothing more than agents for the Cat who all the time
Just controls their operations: the Napoleon of Crime!"
"Song of Myself, 51","The past and present wilt—I have fill'd them, emptied them.
And proceed to fill my next fold of the future.
Listener up there! what have you to confide to me?
Look in my face while I snuff the sidle of evening,
(Talk honestly, no one else hears you, and I stay only a minute longer.)
Do I contradict myself?
Very well then I contradict myself,
(I am large, I contain multitudes.)
I concentrate toward them that are nigh, I wait on the door-slab.
Who has done his day's work? who will soonest be through with his supper?
Who wishes to walk with me?
Will you speak before I am gone? will you prove already too late?"
In Memoriam A. H. H.,"Strong Son of God, immortal Love,
   Whom we, that have not seen thy face,
   By faith, and faith alone, embrace,
Believing where we cannot prove;
 Thine are these orbs of light and shade;
   Thou madest Life in man and brute;
   Thou madest Death; and lo, thy foot
Is on the skull which thou hast made.
 Thou wilt not leave us in the dust:
Thou madest man, he knows not why,
He thinks he was not made to die;
And thou hast made him: thou art just.
 Thou seemest human and divine,
   The highest, holiest manhood, thou.
   Our wills are ours, we know not how;
Our wills are ours, to make them thine.
 Our little systems have their day;
   They have their day and cease to be:
   They are but broken lights of thee,
And thou, O Lord, art more than they.
 We have but faith: we cannot know;
   For knowledge is of things we see
   And yet we trust it comes from thee,
A beam in darkness: let it grow.
 Let knowledge grow from more to more,
   But more of reverence in us dwell;
   That mind and soul, according well,
May make one music as before,
 But vaster. We are fools and slight;
   We mock thee when we do not fear:
   But help thy foolish ones to bear;
Help thy vain worlds to bear thy light.
 Forgive what seem'd my sin in me;
   What seem'd my worth since I began;
   For merit lives from man to man,
And not from man, O Lord, to thee.
 Forgive my grief for one removed,
   Thy creature, whom I found so fair.
   I trust he lives in thee, and there
I find him worthier to be loved.
 Forgive these wild and wandering cries,
   Confusions of a wasted youth;
   Forgive them where they fail in truth,
And in thy wisdom make me wise.
 I
I held it truth, with him who sings
   To one clear harp in divers tones,
   That men may rise on stepping-stones
Of their dead selves to higher things.
 But who shall so forecast the years
   And find in loss a gain to match?
   Or reach a hand thro' time to catch
The far-off interest of tears?
 Let Love clasp Grief lest both be drown'd,
   Let darkness keep her raven gloss:
   Ah, sweeter to be drunk with loss,
To dance with death, to beat the ground,
 Than that the victor Hours should scorn
   The long result of love, and boast,
   `Behold the man that loved and lost,
But all he was is overworn.'
 II
Old Yew, which graspest at the stones
   That name the under-lying dead,
   Thy fibres net the dreamless head,
Thy roots are wrapt about the bones.
 The seasons bring the flower again,
   And bring the firstling to the flock;
   And in the dusk of thee, the clock
Beats out the little lives of men.
 O, not for thee the glow, the bloom,
   Who changest not in any gale,
   Nor branding summer suns avail
To touch thy thousand years of gloom:
 And gazing on thee, sullen tree,
   Sick for thy stubborn hardihood,
   I seem to fail from out my blood
And grow incorporate into thee.
 III
O Sorrow, cruel fellowship,
   O Priestess in the vaults of Death,
   O sweet and bitter in a breath,
What whispers from thy lying lip?
 'The stars,' she whispers, `blindly run;
   A web is wov'n across the sky;
   From out waste places comes a cry,
And murmurs from the dying sun:
 'And all the phantom, Nature, stands—
   With all the music in her tone,
   A hollow echo of my own,—
A hollow form with empty hands.'
 And shall I take a thing so blind,
   Embrace her as my natural good;
   Or crush her, like a vice of blood,
Upon the threshold of the mind?
 IV
To Sleep I give my powers away;
   My will is bondsman to the dark;
   I sit within a helmless bark,
And with my heart I muse and say:
 O heart, how fares it with thee now,
   That thou should'st fail from thy desire,
   Who scarcely darest to inquire,
'What is it makes me beat so low?'
 Something it is which thou hast lost,
   Some pleasure from thine early years.
   Break, thou deep vase of chilling tears,
That grief hath shaken into frost!
 Such clouds of nameless trouble cross
   All night below the darken'd eyes;
   With morning wakes the will, and cries, 
'Thou shalt not be the fool of loss.'
 V
I sometimes hold it half a sin
   To put in words the grief I feel;
   For words, like Nature, half reveal
And half conceal the Soul within.
 But, for the unquiet heart and brain,
   A use in measured language lies;
   The sad mechanic exercise,
Like dull narcotics, numbing pain.
 In words, like weeds, I'll wrap me o'er,
   Like coarsest clothes against the cold:
   But that large grief which these enfold
Is given in outline and no more.
 VI
One writes, that `Other friends remain,'
   That `Loss is common to the race'—
   And common is the commonplace,
And vacant chaff well meant for grain.
 That loss is common would not make
   My own less bitter, rather more:
   Too common! Never morning wore
To evening, but some heart did break.
 O father, wheresoe'er thou be,
   Who pledgest now thy gallant son;
   A shot, ere half thy draught be done,
Hath still'd the life that beat from thee.
 O mother, praying God will save
   Thy sailor,—while thy head is bow'd,
   His heavy-shotted hammock-shroud
Drops in his vast and wandering grave.
 Ye know no more than I who wrought
   At that last hour to please him well;
   Who mused on all I had to tell,
And something written, something thought;
 Expecting still his advent home;
   And ever met him on his way
   With wishes, thinking, `here to-day,'
Or `here to-morrow will he come.'
 O somewhere, meek, unconscious dove,
   That sittest ranging golden hair;
   And glad to find thyself so fair,
Poor child, that waitest for thy love!
 For now her father's chimney glows
   In expectation of a guest;
   And thinking `this will please him best,'
She takes a riband or a rose;
 For he will see them on to-night;
   And with the thought her colour burns;
   And, having left the glass, she turns
Once more to set a ringlet right;
 And, even when she turn'd, the curse
   Had fallen, and her future Lord
   Was drown'd in passing thro' the ford,
Or kill'd in falling from his horse.
 O what to her shall be the end?
   And what to me remains of good?
   To her, perpetual maidenhood,
And unto me no second friend.
 VII
Dark house, by which once more I stand
   Here in the long unlovely street,
   Doors, where my heart was used to beat
So quickly, waiting for a hand,
 A hand that can be clasp'd no more—
   Behold me, for I cannot sleep,
   And like a guilty thing I creep
At earliest morning to the door.
 He is not here; but far away
   The noise of life begins again,
   And ghastly thro' the drizzling rain
On the bald street breaks the blank day.
 VIII
A happy lover who has come
   To look on her that loves him well,
   Who 'lights and rings the gateway bell,
And learns her gone and far from home;
 He saddens, all the magic light
   Dies off at once from bower and hall,
   And all the place is dark, and all
The chambers emptied of delight:
 So find I every pleasant spot
   In which we two were wont to meet,
   The field, the chamber, and the street,
For all is dark where thou art not.
 Yet as that other, wandering there
   In those deserted walks, may find
   A flower beat with rain and wind,
Which once she foster'd up with care;
 So seems it in my deep regret,
   O my forsaken heart, with thee
   And this poor flower of poesy
Which little cared for fades not yet.
 But since it pleased a vanish'd eye,
   I go to plant it on his tomb,
   That if it can it there may bloom,
Or, dying, there at least may die.
 IX
Fair ship, that from the Italian shore
   Sailest the placid ocean-plains
   With my lost Arthur's loved remains,
Spread thy full wings, and waft him o'er.
 So draw him home to those that mourn
   In vain; a favourable speed
   Ruffle thy mirror'd mast, and lead
Thro' prosperous floods his holy urn.
 All night no ruder air perplex
   Thy sliding keel, till Phosphor, bright
   As our pure love, thro' early light
Shall glimmer on the dewy decks.
 Sphere all your lights around, above;
   Sleep, gentle heavens, before the prow;
   Sleep, gentle winds, as he sleeps now,
My friend, the brother of my love;
 My Arthur, whom I shall not see
   Till all my widow'd race be run;
   Dear as the mother to the son,
More than my brothers are to me.
 X
I hear the noise about thy keel;
   I hear the bell struck in the night:
   I see the cabin-window bright;
I see the sailor at the wheel.
 Thou bring'st the sailor to his wife,
   And travell'd men from foreign lands;
   And letters unto trembling hands;
And, thy dark freight, a vanish'd life.
 So bring him; we have idle dreams:
   This look of quiet flatters thus
   Our home-bred fancies. O to us,
The fools of habit, sweeter seems
 To rest beneath the clover sod,
   That takes the sunshine and the rains,
   Or where the kneeling hamlet drains
The chalice of the grapes of God;
 Than if with thee the roaring wells
   Should gulf him fathom-deep in brine;
   And hands so often clasp'd in mine,
Should toss with tangle and with shells.
 XI
Calm is the morn without a sound,
   Calm as to suit a calmer grief,
   And only thro' the faded leaf
The chestnut pattering to the ground:
 Calm and deep peace on this high world,
   And on these dews that drench the furze,
   And all the silvery gossamers
That twinkle into green and gold:
 Calm and still light on yon great plain
   That sweeps with all its autumn bowers,
   And crowded farms and lessening towers,
To mingle with the bounding main:
 Calm and deep peace in this wide air,
   These leaves that redden to the fall;
   And in my heart, if calm at all,
If any calm, a calm despair:
 Calm on the seas, and silver sleep,
   And waves that sway themselves in rest,
   And dead calm in that noble breast
Which heaves but with the heaving deep.
 XII
Lo, as a dove when up she springs
   To bear thro' Heaven a tale of woe,
   Some dolorous message knit below
The wild pulsation of her wings;
 Like her I go; I cannot stay;
   I leave this mortal ark behind,
   A weight of nerves without a mind,
And leave the cliffs, and haste away
 O'er ocean-mirrors rounded large,
   And reach the glow of southern skies,
   And see the sails at distance rise,
And linger weeping on the marge,
 And saying; `Comes he thus, my friend?
   Is this the end of all my care?'
   And circle moaning in the air:
'Is this the end? Is this the end?'
 And forward dart again, and play
   About the prow, and back return
   To where the body sits, and learn
That I have been an hour away.
 XIII
Tears of the widower, when he sees
   A late-lost form that sleep reveals,
   And moves his doubtful arms, and feels
Her place is empty, fall like these;
 Which weep a loss for ever new,
   A void where heart on heart reposed;
   And, where warm hands have prest and closed,
Silence, till I be silent too.
 Which weep the comrade of my choice,
   An awful thought, a life removed,
   The human-hearted man I loved,
A Spirit, not a breathing voice.
 Come, Time, and teach me, many years,
   I do not suffer in a dream;
   For now so strange do these things seem,
Mine eyes have leisure for their tears;
 My fancies time to rise on wing,
   And glance about the approaching sails,
   As tho' they brought but merchants' bales,
And not the burthen that they bring.
 XIV
If one should bring me this report,
   That thou hadst touch'd the land to-day,
   And I went down unto the quay,
And found thee lying in the port;
 And standing, muffled round with woe,
   Should see thy passengers in rank
   Come stepping lightly down the plank,
And beckoning unto those they know;
 And if along with these should come
   The man I held as half-divine;
   Should strike a sudden hand in mine,
And ask a thousand things of home;
 And I should tell him all my pain,
   And how my life had droop'd of late,
   And he should sorrow o'er my state
And marvel what possess'd my brain;
 And I perceived no touch of change,
   No hint of death in all his frame,
   But found him all in all the same,
I should not feel it to be strange.
 XV
To-night the winds begin to rise
   And roar from yonder dropping day:
   The last red leaf is whirl'd away,
The rooks are blown about the skies;
 The forest crack'd, the waters curl'd,
   The cattle huddled on the lea;
   And wildly dash'd on tower and tree
The sunbeam strikes along the world:
 And but for fancies, which aver
   That all thy motions gently pass
   Athwart a plane of molten glass,
I scarce could brook the strain and stir
 That makes the barren branches loud;
   And but for fear it is not so,
   The wild unrest that lives in woe
Would dote and pore on yonder cloud
 That rises upward always higher,
   And onward drags a labouring breast,
   And topples round the dreary west,
A looming bastion fringed with fire.
 XVI
What words are these have falle'n from me?
   Can calm despair and wild unrest
   Be tenants of a single breast,
Or sorrow such a changeling be?
 Or cloth she only seem to take
   The touch of change in calm or storm;
   But knows no more of transient form
In her deep self, than some dead lake
 That holds the shadow of a lark
   Hung in the shadow of a heaven?
   Or has the shock, so harshly given,
Confused me like the unhappy bark
 That strikes by night a craggy shelf,
   And staggers blindly ere she sink?
   And stunn'd me from my power to think
And all my knowledge of myself;
 And made me that delirious man
   Whose fancy fuses old and new,
   And flashes into false and true,
And mingles all without a plan?
 XVII
Thou comest, much wept for: such a breeze
   Compell'd thy canvas, and my prayer
   Was as the whisper of an air
To breathe thee over lonely seas.
 For I in spirit saw thee move
   Thro' circles of the bounding sky,
   Week after week: the days go by:
Come quick, thou bringest all I love.
 Henceforth, wherever thou may'st roam,
   My blessing, like a line of light,
   Is on the waters day and night,
And like a beacon guards thee home.
 So may whatever tempest mars
   Mid-ocean, spare thee, sacred bark;
   And balmy drops in summer dark
Slide from the bosom of the stars.
 So kind an office hath been done,
   Such precious relics brought by thee;
   The dust of him I shall not see
Till all my widow'd race be run.
 XVIII
'Tis well; 'tis something; we may stand
   Where he in English earth is laid,
   And from his ashes may be made
The violet of his native land.
 'Tis little; but it looks in truth
   As if the quiet bones were blest
   Among familiar names to rest
And in the places of his youth.
 Come then, pure hands, and bear the head
   That sleeps or wears the mask of sleep,
   And come, whatever loves to weep,
And hear the ritual of the dead.
 Ah yet, ev'n yet, if this might be,
   I, falling on his faithful heart,
   Would breathing thro' his lips impart
The life that almost dies in me;
 That dies not, but endures with pain,
   And slowly forms the firmer mind,
   Treasuring the look it cannot find,
The words that are not heard again.
 XIX
The Danube to the Severn gave
   The darken'd heart that beat no more;
   They laid him by the pleasant shore,
And in the hearing of the wave.
 There twice a day the Severn fills;
   The salt sea-water passes by,
   And hushes half the babbling Wye,
And makes a silence in the hills.
 The Wye is hush'd nor moved along,
   And hush'd my deepest grief of all,
   When fill'd with tears that cannot fall,
I brim with sorrow drowning song.
 The tide flows down, the wave again
   Is vocal in its wooded walls;
   My deeper anguish also falls,
And I can speak a little then.
 XX
The lesser griefs that may be said,
   That breathe a thousand tender vows,
   Are but as servants in a house
Where lies the master newly dead;
 Who speak their feeling as it is,
   And weep the fulness from the mind:
   `It will be hard,' they say, `to find
Another service such as this.'
 My lighter moods are like to these,
   That out of words a comfort win;
   But there are other griefs within,
And tears that at their fountain freeze;
 For by the hearth the children sit
   Cold in that atmosphere of Death,
   And scarce endure to draw the breath,
Or like to noiseless phantoms flit;
 But open converse is there none,
   So much the vital spirits sink
   To see the vacant chair, and think,
'How good! how kind! and he is gone.'
 XXI
I sing to him that rests below,
   And, since the grasses round me wave,
   I take the grasses of the grave,
And make them pipes whereon to blow.
 The traveller hears me now and then,
   And sometimes harshly will he speak:
   `This fellow would make weakness weak,
And melt the waxen hearts of men.'
 Another answers, `Let him be,
   He loves to make parade of pain
   That with his piping he may gain
The praise that comes to constancy.'
 A third is wroth: `Is this an hour
   For private sorrow's barren song,
   When more and more the people throng
The chairs and thrones of civil power?
 'A time to sicken and to swoon,
   When Science reaches forth her arms
   To feel from world to world, and charms
Her secret from the latest moon?'
 Behold, ye speak an idle thing:
   Ye never knew the sacred dust:
   I do but sing because I must,
And pipe but as the linnets sing:
 And one is glad; her note is gay,
   For now her little ones have ranged;
   And one is sad; her note is changed,
Because her brood is stol'n away.
 XXII
The path by which we twain did go,
   Which led by tracts that pleased us well,
   Thro' four sweet years arose and fell,
From flower to flower, from snow to snow:
 And we with singing cheer'd the way,
   And, crown'd with all the season lent,
   From April on to April went,
And glad at heart from May to May:
 But where the path we walk'd began
   To slant the fifth autumnal slope,
   As we descended following Hope,
There sat the Shadow fear'd of man;
 Who broke our fair companionship,
   And spread his mantle dark and cold,
   And wrapt thee formless in the fold,
And dull'd the murmur on thy lip,
 And bore thee where I could not see
   Nor follow, tho' I walk in haste,
   And think, that somewhere in the waste
The Shadow sits and waits for me.
 XXIII
Now, sometimes in my sorrow shut,
   Or breaking into song by fits,
   Alone, alone, to where he sits,
The Shadow cloak'd from head to foot,
 Who keeps the keys of all the creeds,
   I wander, often falling lame,
   And looking back to whence I came,
Or on to where the pathway leads;
 And crying, How changed from where it ran
   Thro' lands where not a leaf was dumb;
   But all the lavish hills would hum
The murmur of a happy Pan:
 When each by turns was guide to each,
   And Fancy light from Fancy caught,
   And Thought leapt out to wed with Thought
Ere Thought could wed itself with Speech;
 And all we met was fair and good,
   And all was good that Time could bring,
   And all the secret of the Spring
Moved in the chambers of the blood;
 And many an old philosophy
   On Argive heights divinely sang,
   And round us all the thicket rang
To many a flute of Arcady.
 XXIV
And was the day of my delight
   As pure and perfect as I say?
   The very source and fount of Day
Is dash'd with wandering isles of night.
 If all was good and fair we met,
   This earth had been the Paradise
   It never look'd to human eyes
Since our first Sun arose and set.
 And is it that the haze of grief
   Makes former gladness loom so great?
   The lowness of the present state,
That sets the past in this relief?
 Or that the past will always win
   A glory from its being far;
   And orb into the perfect star
We saw not, when we moved therein?
 XXV
I know that this was Life,—the track
   Whereon with equal feet we fared;
   And then, as now, the day prepared
The daily burden for the back.
 But this it was that made me move
   As light as carrier-birds in air;
   I loved the weight I had to bear,
Because it needed help of Love:
 Nor could I weary, heart or limb,
   When mighty Love would cleave in twain
   The lading of a single pain,
And part it, giving half to him.
 XXVI
Still onward winds the dreary way;
   I with it; for I long to prove
   No lapse of moons can canker Love,
Whatever fickle tongues may say.
 And if that eye which watches guilt
   And goodness, and hath power to see
   Within the green the moulder'd tree,
And towers fall'n as soon as built—
 Oh, if indeed that eye foresee
   Or see (in Him is no before)
   In more of life true life no more
And Love the indifference to be,
 Then might I find, ere yet the morn
   Breaks hither over Indian seas,
   That Shadow waiting with the keys,
To shroud me from my proper scorn.
 XXVII
I envy not in any moods
   The captive void of noble rage,
   The linnet born within the cage,
That never knew the summer woods:
 I envy not the beast that takes
   His license in the field of time,
   Unfetter'd by the sense of crime,
To whom a conscience never wakes;
 Nor, what may count itself as blest,
   The heart that never plighted troth
   But stagnates in the weeds of sloth;
Nor any want-begotten rest.
 I hold it true, whate'er befall;
   I feel it, when I sorrow most;
   'Tis better to have loved and lost
Than never to have loved at all."
On Friendship,"And a youth said, Speak to us of Friendship.
    And he answered, saying:
    Your friend is your needs answered.
    He is your field which you sow with love and reap with thanksgiving.
    And he is your board and your fireside.
    For you come to him with your hunger, and you seek him for peace.
    When your friend speaks his mind you fear not the “nay” in your own mind, nor do you withhold the “ay.”
    And when he is silent your heart ceases not to listen to his heart;
    For without words, in friendship, all thoughts, all desires, all expectations are born and shared, with joy that is unacclaimed.
    When you part from your friend, you grieve not;
    For that which you love most in him may be clearer in his absence, as the mountain to the climber is clearer from the plain.
    And let there be no purpose in friendship save the deepening of the spirit.
    For love that seeks aught but the disclosure of its own mystery us not love but a net cast forth: and only the unprofitable is caught.
    And let your best be for your friend.
    If he must know the ebb of your tide, let him know its flood also.
    For what is your friend that you should seek him with hours to kill?
    Seek him always with hours to live.
    For it is his to fill your need but not your emptiness.
    And in the sweetness of friendship let there be laughter, and sharing of pleasures.
    For in the dew of little things the heart finds its morning and is refreshed."
Wind and Window Flower,"Lovers, forget your love,
     And list to the love of these,
She a window flower,
     And he a winter breeze.

When the frosty window veil
     Was melted down at noon,
And the cagèd yellow bird
     Hung over her in tune,

He marked her through the pane,
     He could not help but mark,
And only passed her by,
     To come again at dark.

He was a winter wind,
     Concerned with ice and snow,
Dead weeds and unmated birds,
     And little of love could know.

But he sighed upon the sill,
     He gave the sash a shake,
As witness all within
     Who lay that night awake.

Perchance he half prevailed
     To win her for the flight
From the firelit looking-glass
     And warm stove-window light.

But the flower leaned aside
     And thought of naught to say,
And morning found the breeze
     A hundred miles away."
My November Guest,"My sorrow, when she’s here with me,
     Thinks these dark days of autumn rain
Are beautiful as days can be;
She loves the bare, the withered tree;
     She walks the sodden pasture lane.
Her pleasure will not let me stay.
     She talks and I am fain to list:
She’s glad the birds are gone away,
She’s glad her simple worsted grey
     Is silver now with clinging mist.
The desolate, deserted trees,
     The faded earth, the heavy sky,
The beauties she so truly sees,
She thinks I have no eye for these,
     And vexes me for reason why.
Not yesterday I learned to know
     The love of bare November days
Before the coming of the snow,
But it were vain to tell her so,
     And they are better for her praise."
The Bonfire,"“Oh, let’s go up the hill and scare ourselves,
As reckless as the best of them to-night,
By setting fire to all the brush we piled
With pitchy hands to wait for rain or snow.
Oh, let’s not wait for rain to make it safe.
The pile is ours: we dragged it bough on bough
Down dark converging paths between the pines.
Let’s not care what we do with it to-night.
Divide it? No! But burn it as one pile
The way we piled it. And let’s be the talk
Of people brought to windows by a light
Thrown from somewhere against their wall-paper.
Rouse them all, both the free and not so free
With saying what they’d like to do to us
For what they’d better wait till we have done.
Let’s all but bring to life this old volcano,
If that is what the mountain ever was—
And scare ourselves. Let wild fire loose we will….”

“And scare you too?” the children said together.

“Why wouldn’t it scare me to have a fire
Begin in smudge with ropy smoke and know
That still, if I repent, I may recall it,
But in a moment not: a little spurt
Of burning fatness, and then nothing but
The fire itself can put it out, and that
By burning out, and before it burns out
It will have roared first and mixed sparks with stars,
And sweeping round it with a flaming sword,
Made the dim trees stand back in wider circle—
Done so much and I know not how much more
I mean it shall not do if I can bind it.
Well if it doesn’t with its draft bring on
A wind to blow in earnest from some quarter,
As once it did with me upon an April.
The breezes were so spent with winter blowing
They seemed to fail the bluebirds under them
Short of the perch their languid flight was toward;
And my flame made a pinnacle to heaven
As I walked once round it in possession.
But the wind out of doors—you know the saying.
There came a gust. You used to think the trees
Made wind by fanning since you never knew
It blow but that you saw the trees in motion.
Something or someone watching made that gust.
It put the flame tip-down and dabbed the grass
Of over-winter with the least tip-touch
Your tongue gives salt or sugar in your hand.
The place it reached to blackened instantly.
The black was all there was by day-light,
That and the merest curl of cigarette smoke—
And a flame slender as the hepaticas,
Blood-root, and violets so soon to be now.
But the black spread like black death on the ground,
And I think the sky darkened with a cloud
Like winter and evening coming on together.
There were enough things to be thought of then.
Where the field stretches toward the north
And setting sun to Hyla brook, I gave it
To flames without twice thinking, where it verges
Upon the road, to flames too, though in fear
They might find fuel there, in withered brake,
Grass its full length, old silver golden-rod,
And alder and grape vine entanglement,
To leap the dusty deadline. For my own
I took what front there was beside. I knelt
And thrust hands in and held my face away.
Fight such a fire by rubbing not by beating.
A board is the best weapon if you have it.
I had my coat. And oh, I knew, I knew,
And said out loud, I couldn’t bide the smother
And heat so close in; but the thought of all
The woods and town on fire by me, and all
The town turned out to fight for me—that held me.
I trusted the brook barrier, but feared
The road would fail; and on that side the fire
Died not without a noise of crackling wood—
Of something more than tinder-grass and weed—
That brought me to my feet to hold it back
By leaning back myself, as if the reins
Were round my neck and I was at the plough.
I won! But I’m sure no one ever spread
Another color over a tenth the space
That I spread coal-black over in the time
It took me. Neighbors coming home from town
Couldn’t believe that so much black had come there
While they had backs turned, that it hadn’t been there
When they had passed an hour or so before
Going the other way and they not seen it.
They looked about for someone to have done it.
But there was no one. I was somewhere wondering
Where all my weariness had gone and why
I walked so light on air in heavy shoes
In spite of a scorched Fourth-of-July feeling.
Why wouldn’t I be scared remembering that?”

“If it scares you, what will it do to us?”

“Scare you. But if you shrink from being scared,
What would you say to war if it should come?
That’s what for reasons I should like to know—
If you can comfort me by any answer.”

“Oh, but war’s not for children—it’s for men.”

“Now we are digging almost down to China.
My dears, my dears, you thought that—we all thought it.
So your mistake was ours. Haven’t you heard, though,
About the ships where war has found them out
At sea, about the towns where war has come
Through opening clouds at night with droning speed
Further o’erhead than all but stars and angels,—
And children in the ships and in the towns?
Haven’t you heard what we have lived to learn?
Nothing so new—something we had forgotten:
War is for everyone, for children too.
I wasn’t going to tell you and I mustn’t.
The best way is to come up hill with me
And have our fire and laugh and be afraid.”"

Sri Lankan radical women never come alone. 
We have a tradition of coming in groups of three or four, minimum.

Then there’s your sister, your cousin, your great-aunties

We come in packs                       we argue

we love each other very much but can’t stand to be in the same room or  continent for years. 
We do things like, oh, start the first rape crisis center in Jaffna in a war zone
in someone’s living room with no funding. 
When war forces our hands, 
we all move to Australia or London or Thunder Bay together

They ask about steroids and sleep. About asking for help.
About how they will ever possibly convince their friends and family

I am generous—we crips always are. 
They were me. 
They don’t know if they can call themselves that,

Kissing in Vietnamese,"My grandmother kisses
as if bombs are bursting in the backyard,

as if to walk out the door, your torso
would dance from exit wounds.
When my grandmother kisses, there would be
no flashy smooching, no western music
of pursed lips, she kisses as if to breathe
you inside her, nose pressed to cheek
so that your scent is relearned

inside her lungs, as if while she holds you
death also, is clutching your wrist.

Perhaps the World Ends Here,"The world begins at a kitchen table. No matter what, we must eat to live.
The gifts of earth are brought and prepared, set on the table. So it has been since creation, and it will go on.
We chase chickens or dogs away from it. Babies teethe at the corners. They scrape their knees under it.
It is here that children are given instructions on what it means to be human. We make men at it, we make women.
At this table we gossip, recall enemies and the ghosts of lovers.
Our dreams drink coffee with us as they put their arms around our children. They laugh with us at our poor falling-down selves and as we put ourselves back together once again at the table.
This table has been a house in the rain, an umbrella in the sun.
Wars have begun and ended at this table. It is a place to hide in the shadow of terror. A place to celebrate the terrible victory.
We have given birth on this table, and have prepared our parents for burial here.
At this table we sing with joy, with sorrow. We pray of suffering and remorse. We give thanks.

Say we spend our last moments staring

Evangeline: A Tale of Acadie,"Prelude
This is the forest primeval. The murmuring pines and the hemlocks,
Bearded with moss, and in garments green, indistinct in the twilight,
Stand like Druids of eld, with voices sad and prophetic,
Stand like harpers hoar, with beards that rest on their bosoms.
Loud from its rocky caverns, the deep-voiced neighboring ocean
Speaks, and in accents disconsolate answers the wail of the forest.
This is the forest primeval; but where are the hearts that beneath it
Leaped like the roe, when he hears in the woodland the voice of the huntsman
Where is the thatch-roofed village, the home of Acadian farmers,
Men whose lives glided on like rivers that water the woodlands,
Darkened by shadows of earth, but reflecting an image of heaven?
Waste are those pleasant farms, and the farmers forever departed!
Scattered like dust and leaves, when the mighty blasts of October
Seize them, and whirl them aloft, and sprinkle them far o'er the ocean
Naught but tradition remains of the beautiful village of Grand-Pré.
Ye who believe in affection that hopes, and endures, and is patient,
Ye who believe in the beauty and strength of woman's devotion,
List to the mournful tradition still sung by the pines of the forest;
List to a Tale of Love in Acadie, home of the happy.
Part the First
Canto I
In the Acadian land, on the shores of the Basin of Minas,
Distant, secluded, still, the little village of Grand-Pré
Lay in the fruitful valley. Vast meadows stretched to the eastward,
Giving the village its name, and pasture to flocks without number.
Dikes, that the hands of the farmers had raised with labor incessant,
Shut out the turbulent tides; but at stated seasons the flood-gates
Opened, and welcomed the sea to wander at will o'er the meadows.
West and south there were fields of flax, and orchards and cornfields
Spreading afar and unfenced o'er the plain; and away to the northward
Blomidon rose, and the forests old, and aloft on the mountains
Sea-fogs pitched their tents, and mists from the mighty Atlantic
Looked on the happy valley, but ne'er from their station descended
There, in the midst of its farms, reposed the Acadian village.
Strongly built were the houses, with frames of oak and of hemlock,
Such as the peasants of Normandy built in the reign of the Henries.
Thatched were the roofs, with dormer-windows; and gables projecting
Over the basement below protected and shaded the doorway.
There in the tranquil evenings of summer, when brightly the sunset
Lighted the village street and gilded the vanes on the chimneys,
Matrons and maidens sat in snow-white caps and in kirtles
Scarlet and blue and green, with distaffs spinning the golden
Flax for the gossiping looms, whose noisy shuttles within doors
Mingled their sound with the whir of the wheels and the songs of the maidens,
Solemnly down the street came the parish priest, and the children
Paused in their play to kiss the hand he extended to bless them.
Reverend walked he among them; and up rose matrons and maidens,
Hailing his slow approach with words of affectionate welcome.
Then came the laborers home from the field, and serenely the sun sank
Down to his rest, and twilight prevailed. Anon from the belfry
Softly the Angelus sounded, and over the roofs of the village
Columns of pale blue smoke, like clouds of incense ascending,
Rose from a hundred hearths, the homes of peace and contentment.
Thus dwelt together in love these simple Acadian farmers,—
Dwelt in the love of God and of man. Alike were they free from
Fear, that reigns with the tyrant, and envy, the vice of republics.
Neither locks had they to their doors, nor bars to their windows;
But their dwellings were open as day and the hearts of their owners;
There the richest was poor, and the poorest lived in abundance.
Somewhat apart from the village, and nearer the Basin of Minas,
Benedict Bellefontaine, the wealthiest farmer of Grand-Pré,
Dwelt on his goodly acres: and with him, directing his household,
Gentle Evangeline lived, his child, and the pride of the village.
Stalworth and stately in form was the man of seventy winters;
Hearty and hale was he, an oak that is covered with snow-flakes;
White as the snow were his locks, and his cheeks as brown as the oak-leaves.
Fair was she to behold, that maiden of seventeen summers.
Black were her eyes as the berry that grows on the thorn by the wayside,
Black, yet how softly they gleamed beneath the brown shade of her tresses!
Sweet was her breath as the breath of kine that feed in the meadows.
When in the harvest heat she bore to the reapers at noontide
Flagons of home-brewed ale, ah! fair in sooth was the maiden,
Fairer was she when, on Sunday morn, while the bell from its turret
Sprinkled with holy sounds the air, as the priest with his hyssop
Sprinkles the congregation, and scatters blessings upon them,
Down the long street she passed, with her chaplet of beads and her missal,
Wearing her Norman cap and her kirtle of blue, and the ear-rings,
Brought in the olden time from France, and since, as an heirloom,
Handed down from mother to child, through long generations.
But a celestial brightness—a more ethereal beauty—
Shone on her face and encircled her form, when, after confession,
Homeward serenely she walked with God's benediction upon her.
When she had passed, it seemed like the ceasing of exquisite music.
Firmly builded with rafters of oak, the house of the farmer
Stood on the side of a hill commanding the sea; and a shady
Sycamore grew by the door, with a woodbine wreathing around it.
Rudely carved was the porch, with seats beneath; and a footpath
Led through an orchard wide, and disappeared in the meadow.
Under the Sycamore-tree were hives overhung by a penthouse,
Such as the traveller sees in regions remote by the roadside,
Built o'er a box for the poor, or the blessed image of Mary.
Farther down, on the slope of the hill, was the well with its moss-grown
Bucket, fastened with iron, and near it a trough for the horses.
Shielding the house from storms, on the north, were the barns and the farm-yard,
There stood the broad-wheeled wains and the antique ploughs and the harrows;
There were the folds for the sheep; and there, in his feathered seraglio,
Strutted the lordly turkey, and crowed the cock, with the selfsame
Voice that in ages of old had startled the penitent Peter.
Bursting with hay were the barns, themselves a village. In each one
Far o'er the gable projected a roof of thatch; and a staircase,
Under the sheltering eaves, led up to the odorous corn-loft.
There too the dove-cot stood, with its meek and innocent inmates
Murmuring ever of love; while above in the variant breezes
Numberless noisy weathercocks rattled and sang of mutation.
Thus, at peace with God and the world, the farmer of Grand-Pré
Lived on his sunny farm, and Evangeline governed his household.
Many a youth, as he knelt in the church and opened his missal,
Fixed his eyes upon her as the saint of his deepest devotion;
Happy was he who might touch her hand or the hem of her garment!
Many a suitor came to her door, by the darkness befriended,
And, as he knocked and waited to hear the sound of her footsteps,
Knew not which beat the louder, his heart or the knocker of iron;
Or at the joyous feast of the Patron Saint of the village,
Bolder grew, and pressed her hand in the dance as he whispered
Hurried words of love, that seemed a part of the music.
But, among all who came, young Gabriel only was welcome;
Gabriel Lajeunesse, the son of Basil the blacksmith,
Who was a mighty man in the village, and honored of all men;
For, since the birth of time, throughout all ages and nations,
Has the craft of the smith been held in repute by the people.
Basil was Benedict's friend. Their children from earliest childhood
Grew up together as brother and sister; and Father Felician,
Priest and pedagogue both in the village, had taught them their letters
Out of the selfsame book, with the hymns of the church and the plain-song.
But when the hymn was sung, and the daily lesson completed,
Swiftly they hurried away to the forge of Basil the blacksmith.
There at the door they stood, with wondering eyes to behold him
Take in his leathern lap the hoof of the horse as a plaything,
Nailing the shoe in its place; while near him the tire of the cart-wheel
Lay like a fiery snake, coiled round in a circle of cinders.
Oft on autumnal eves, when without in the gathering darkness
Bursting with light seemed the smithy, through every cranny and crevice,
Warm by the forge within they watched the laboring bellows,
And as its panting ceased, and the sparks expired in the ashes,
Merrily laughed, and said they were nuns going into the chapel.
Oft on sledges in winter, as swift as the swoop of the eagle,
Down the hillside hounding, they glided away o'er the meadow.
Oft in the barns they climbed to the populous nests on the rafters,
Seeking with eager eyes that wondrous stone, which the swallow

Brings from the shore of the sea to restore the sight of its fledglings;
Lucky was he who found that stone in the nest of the swallow!
Thus passed a few swift years, and they no longer were children.
He was a valiant youth, and his face, like the face of the morning,
Gladdened the earth with its light, and ripened thought into action.
She was a woman now, with the heart and hopes of a woman.
""Sunshine of Saint Eulalie"" was she called; for that was the sunshine
Which, as the farmers believed, would load their orchards with apples
She, too, would bring to her husband's house delight and abundance,
Filling it full of love and the ruddy faces of children.
Canto II
Now had the season returned, when the nights grow colder and longer,
And the retreating sun the sign of the Scorpion enters.
Birds of passage sailed through the leaden air, from the ice-bound,
Desolate northern bays to the shores of tropical islands,
Harvests were gathered in; and wild with the winds of September
Wrestled the trees of the forest, as Jacob of old with the angel.
All the signs foretold a winter long and inclement.
Bees, with prophetic instinct of want, had hoarded their honey
Till the hives overflowed; and the Indian hunters asserted
Cold would the winter be, for thick was the fur of the foxes.
Such was the advent of autumn. Then followed that beautiful season,
Called by the pious Acadian peasants the Summer of All-Saints!
Filled was the air with a dreamy and magical light; and the landscape
Lay as if new-created in all the freshness of childhood.
Peace seemed to reign upon earth, and the restless heart of the ocean
Was for a moment consoled. All sounds were in harmony blended.
Voices of children at play, the crowing of cocks in the farm-yards,
Whir of wings in the drowsy air, and the cooing of pigeons,
All were subdued and low as the murmurs of love, and the great sun
Looked with the eye of love through the golden vapors around him;
While arrayed in its robes of russet and scarlet and yellow,
Bright with the sheen of the dew, each glittering tree of the forest
Flashed like the plane-tree the Persian adorned with mantles and jewels.
Now recommenced the reign of rest and affection and stillness.
Day with its burden and heat had departed, and twilight descending
Brought back the evening star to the sky, and the herds to the homestead.
Pawing the ground they came, and resting their necks on each other,
And with their nostrils distended inhaling the freshness of evening.
Foremost, bearing the bell, Evangeline's beautiful heifer,
Proud of her snow-white hide, and the ribbon that waved from her collar,
Quietly paced and slow, as if conscious of human affection.
Then came the shepherd back with his bleating flocks from the seaside,
Where was their favorite pasture. Behind them followed the watch-dog,
Patient, full of importance, and grand in the pride of his instinct,
Walking from side to side with a lordly air, and superbly
Waving his bushy tail, and urging forward the stragglers;
Regent of flocks was he when the shepherd slept; their protector,
When from the forest at night, through the starry silence, the wolves howled.
Late, with the rising moon, returned the wains from the marshes,
Laden with briny hay, that filled the air with its odor.
Cheerily neighed the steeds, with dew on their manes and their fetlocks,
While aloft on their shoulders the wooden and ponderous saddles,
Painted with brilliant dyes, and adorned with tassels of crimson,
Nodded in bright array, like hollyhocks heavy with blossoms.
Patiently stood the cows meanwhile, and yielded their udders
Unto the milkmaid's hand; whilst loud and in regular cadence
Into the sounding pails the foaming streamlets descended.
Lowing of cattle and peals of laughter were heard in the farm-yard,
Echoed back by the barns. Anon they sank into stillness;
Heavily closed, with a jarring sound, the valves of the barn-doors,
Rattled the wooden bars, and all for a season was silent.
In-doors, warm by the wide-mouthed fireplace, idly the farmer
Sat in his elbow-chair, and watched how the flames and the smoke-wreaths
Struggled together like foes in a burning city. Behind him,
Nodding and mocking along the wall, with gestures fantastic,
Darted his own huge shadow, and vanished away into darkness.
Faces, clumsily carved in oak, on the back of his arm-chair
Laughed in the flickering light, and the pewter plates on the dresser
Caught and reflected the flame, as shields of armies the sunshine.
Fragments of song the old man sang, and carols of Christmas,
Such as at home, in the olden time, his fathers before him
Sang in their Norman orchards and bright Burgundian vineyards.
Close at her father's side was the gentle Evangeline seated,
Spinning flax for the loom, that stood in the corner behind her.
Silent awhile were its treadles, at rest was its diligent shuttle,
While the monotonous drone of the wheel, like the drone of a bagpipe,
Followed the old man's songs and united the fragments together.
As in a church, when the chant of the choir at intervals ceases,
Footfalls are heard in the aisles, or words of the priest at the altar,
So, in each pause of the song, with measured motion the clock clicked.
Thus as they sat, there were footsteps heard, and, suddenly lifted,
Sounded the wooden latch, and the door swung back on its hinges.
Benedict knew by the hob-nailed shoes it was Basil the blacksmith,
And by her beating heart Evangeline knew who was with him.
""Welcome!"" the farmer exclaimed, as their footsteps paused on the threshold.
""Welcome, Basil, my friend! Come, take thy place on the settle
Close by the chimney-side, which is always empty without thee;
Take from the shelf overhead thy pipe and the box of tobacco;
Never so much thyself art thou as when through the curling
Smoke of the pipe or the forge thy friendly and jovial face gleams
Round and red as the harvest moon through the mist of the marshes.""
Then, with a smile of content, thus answered Basil the blacksmith,
Taking with easy air the accustomed seat by the fireside:—
""Benedict Bellefontaine, thou hast ever thy jest and thy ballad!
Ever in cheerfullest mood art thou, when others are filled with
Gloomy forebodings of ill, and see only ruin before them.
Happy art thou, as if every day thou hadst picked up a horseshoe.""
Pausing a moment, to take the pipe that Evangeline brought him,
And with a coal from the embers had lighted, he slowly continued:—
""Four days now are passed since the English ships at their anchors
Ride in the Gaspereau's mouth, with their cannon pointed against us.
What their design may be is unknown; but all are commanded
On the morrow to meet in the church, where his Majesty's mandate
Will be proclaimed as law in the land. Alas! in the mean time
Many surmises of evil alarm the hearts of the people.""
Then made answer the farmer:—""Perhaps some friendlier purpose
Brings these ships to our shores. Perhaps the harvests in England
By untimely rains or untimelier heat have been blighted,
And from our bursting barns they would feed their cattle and children.""
""Not so thinketh the folk in the village,"" said, warmly, the blacksmith,
Shaking his head, as in doubt; then, heaving a sigh, he continued:—
""Louisburg is not forgotten, nor Beau Sejour, nor Port Royal.
Many already have fled to the forest, and lurk on its outskirts,
Waiting with anxious hearts the dubious fate of to-morrow.
Arms have been taken from us, and warlike weapons of all kinds;
Nothing is left but the blacksmith's sledge and the scythe of the mower.""
Then with a pleasant smile made answer the jovial farmer:—
""Safer are we unarmed, in the midst of our flocks and our cornfields,
Safer within these peaceful dikes, besieged by the ocean,
Than our fathers in forts, besieged by the enemy's cannon.
Fear no evil, my friend, and to-night may no shadow of sorrow
Fall on this house and hearth; for this is the night of the contract.
Built are the house and the barn. The merry lads of the village
Strongly have built them and well; and, breaking the glebe round about them,
Filled the barn with hay, and the house with food for a twelvemonth.
Rene Leblanc will be here anon, with his papers and inkhorn.
Shall we not then be glad, and rejoice in the joy of our children?""
As apart by the window she stood, with her hand in her lover's,
Blushing Evangeline heard the words that her father had spoken,
And, as they died on his lips, the worthy notary entered.
Canto III
Bent like a laboring oar, that toils in the surf of the ocean,
Bent, but not broken, by age was the form of the notary public;
Shocks of yellow hair, like the silken floss of the maize, hung
Over his shoulders; his forehead was high; and glasses with horn bows
Sat astride on his nose, with a look of wisdom supernal.
Father of twenty children was he, and more than a hundred
Children's children rode on his knee, and heard his great watch tick.
Four long years in the times of the war had he languished a captive,
Suffering much in an old French fort as the friend of the English.
Now, though warier grown, without all guile or suspicion,
Ripe in wisdom was he, but patient, and simple, and childlike.
He was beloved by all, and most of all by the children;
For he told them tales of the Loup-garou in the forest,
And of the goblin that came in the night to water the horses,
And of the white Letiche, the ghost of a child who unchristened
Died, and was doomed to haunt unseen the chambers of children;
And how on Christmas eve the oxen talked in the stable,
And how the fever was cured by a spider shut up in a nutshell,
And of the marvellous powers of four-leaved clover and horseshoes,
With whatsoever else was writ in the lore of the village.
Then up rose from his seat by the fireside Basil the blacksmith,
Knocked from his pipe the ashes, and slowly extending his right hand,
""Father Leblanc,"" he exclaimed, ""thou hast heard the talk in the village,
And, perchance, canst tell us some news of these ships and their errand.""
Then with modest demeanor made answer the notary public,—
""Gossip enough have I heard, in sooth, yet am never the wiser;
And what their errand may be I know not better than others.
Yet am I not of those who imagine some evil intention
Brings them here, for we are at peace; and why then molest us?""
""God's name!"" shouted the hasty and somewhat irascible blacksmith;
""Must we in all things look for the how, and the why, and the wherefore?
Daily injustice is done, and might is the right of the strongest!""
But, without heeding his warmth, continued the notary public,—
""Man is unjust, but God is just; and finally justice
Triumphs; and well I remember a story, that often consoled me,
When as a captive I lay in the old French fort at Port Royal.""
This was the old man's favorite tale, and he loved to repeat it
When his neighbors complained that any injustice was done them.
""Once in an ancient city, whose name I no longer remember,
Raised aloft on a column, a brazen statue of Justice
Stood in the public square, upholding the scales in its left hand,
And in its right a sword, as an emblem that justice presided
Over the laws of the land, and the hearts and homes of the people.
Even the birds had built their nests in the scales of the balance,
Having no fear of the sword that flashed in the sunshine above them.
But in the course of time the laws of the land were corrupted;
Might took the place of right, and the weak were oppressed, and the mighty
Ruled with an iron rod. Then it chanced in a nobleman's palace
That a necklace of pearls was lost, and erelong a suspicion
Fell on an orphan girl who lived as maid in the household.
She, after form of trial condemned to die on the scaffold,
Patiently met her doom at the foot of the statue of Justice.
As to her Father in heaven her innocent spirit ascended,
Lo! o'er the city a tempest rose; and the bolts of the thunder
Smote the statue of bronze, and hurled in wrath from its left hand
Down on the pavement below the clattering scales of the balance,
And in the hollow thereof was found the nest of a magpie,
Into whose clay-built walls the necklace of pearls was inwoven.""
Silenced, but not convinced, when the story was ended, the blacksmith
Stood like a man who fain would speak, but findeth no language;
All his thoughts were congealed into lines on his face, as the vapors
Freeze in fantastic shapes on the window-panes in the winter.
Then Evangeline lighted the brazen lamp on the table,
Filled, till it overflowed, the pewter tankard with home-brewed
Nut-brown ale, that was famed for its strength in the village of Grand-Pré;
While from his pocket the notary drew his papers and inkhorn,
Wrote with a steady hand the date and the age of the parties,
Naming the dower of the bride in flocks of sheep and in cattle.
Orderly all things proceeded, and duly and well were completed,
And the great seal of the law was set like a sun on the margin.
Then from his leathern pouch the farmer threw on the table
Three times the old man's fee in solid pieces of silver;
And the notary rising, and blessing the bride and the bridegroom,
Lifted aloft the tankard of ale and drank to their welfare.
Wiping the foam from his lip, he solemnly bowed and departed,
While in silence the others sat and mused by the fireside,
Till Evangeline brought the draught-board out of its corner.
Soon was the game begun. In friendly contention the old men
Laughed at each lucky hit, or unsuccessful manoeuver,
Laughed when a man was crowned, or a breach was made in the king-row
Meanwhile apart, in the twilight gloom of a window's embrasure,
Sat the lovers, and whispered together, beholding the moon rise
Over the pallid sea and the silvery mist of the meadows.
Silently one by one, in the infinite meadows of heaven,
Blossomed the lovely stars, the forget-me-nots of the angels.
Thus was the evening passed. Anon the bell from the belfry
Rang out the hour of nine, the village curfew, and straightway
Rose the guests and departed; and silence reigned in the household.
Many a farewell word and sweet good-night on the door-step
Lingered long in Evangeline's heart, and filled it with gladness.
Carefully then were covered the embers that glowed on the hearth-stone,
And on the oaken stairs resounded the tread of the farmer.
Soon with a soundless step the foot of Evangeline followed.
Up the staircase moved a luminous space in the darkness,
Lighted less by the lamp than the shining face of the maiden.
Silent she passed the hall, and entered the door of her chamber.
Simple that chamber was, with its curtains of white, and its clothes-press
Ample and high, on whose spacious shelves were carefully folded
Linen and woollen stuffs, by the hand of Evangeline woven.
This was the precious dower she would bring to her husband in marriage,
Better than flocks and herds, being proofs of her skill as a housewife.
Soon she extinguished her lamp, for the mellow and radiant moonlight
Streamed through the windows, and lighted the room, till the heart of the maiden
Swelled and obeyed its power, like the tremulous tides of the ocean.
Ah! she was fair, exceeding fair to behold, as she stood with
Naked snow-white feet on the gleaming floor of her chamber!
Little she dreamed that below, among the trees of the orchard,
Waited her lover and watched for the gleam of her lamp and her shadow.
Yet were her thoughts of him, and at times a feeling of sadness
Passed o'er her soul, as the sailing shade of clouds in the moonlight
Flitted across the floor and darkened the room for a moment.
And, as she gazed from the window, she saw serenely the moon pass
Forth from the folds of a cloud, and one star follow her footsteps,
As out of Abraham's tent young Ishmael wandered with Hagar!
Canto IV
Pleasantly rose next morn the sun on the village of Grand-Pré.
Pleasantly gleamed in the soft, sweet air the Basin of Minas,
the ships, with their wavering shadows, were riding at anchor.
Life had long been astir in the village, and clamorous labor
Knocked with its hundred hands at the golden gates of the morning.
Now from the country around, from the farms and neighboring hamlets,
Came in their holiday dresses the blithe Acadian peasants.
Many a glad good-morrow and jocund laugh from the young folk
Made the bright air brighter, as up from the numerous meadows,
Where no path could be seen but the track of wheels in the greensward,
Group after group appeared, and joined, or passed on the highway.
Long ere noon, in the village all sounds of labor were silenced.
Thronged were the streets with people; and noisy groups at the house-doors
Sat in the cheerful sun, and rejoiced and gossiped together.
Every house was an inn, where all were welcomed and feasted;
For with this simple people, who lived like brothers together,
All things were held in common, and what one had was another's.
Yet under Benedict's roof hospitality seemed more abundant:
For Evangeline stood among the guests of her father;
Bright was her face with smiles, and words of welcome and gladness
Fell from her beautiful lips, and blessed the cup as she gave it.
Under the open sky, in the odorous air of the orchard,
Stript of its golden fruit, was spread the feast of betrothal.
There in the shade of the porch were the priest and the notary seated;
There good Benedict sat, and sturdy Basil the blacksmith.
Not far withdrawn from these, by the cider-press and the beehives,
Michael the fiddler was placed, with the gayest of hearts and of waistcoats.
Shadow and light from the leaves alternately played on his snow-white
Hair, as it waved in the wind; and the jolly face of the fiddler
Glowed like a living coal when the ashes are blown from the embers.
Gayly the old man sang to the vibrant sound of his fiddle,
Tous les Bourgeois de Chartres, and Le Carillon de Dunkerque,
And anon with his wooden shoes beat time to the music.
Merrily, merrily whirled the wheels of the dizzying dances
Under the orchard-trees and down the path to the meadows;
Old folk and young together, and children mingled among them.
Fairest of all the maids was Evangeline, Benedict's daughter!
Noblest of all the youths was Gabriel, son of the blacksmith!
So passed the morning away. And lo! with a summons sonorous
Sounded the bell from its tower, and over the meadows a drum beat.
Thronged erelong was the church with men. Without, in the churchyard,
Waited the women. They stood by the graves, and hung on the headstones
Garlands of autumn-leaves and evergreens fresh from the forest.
Then came the guard from the ships, and marching proudly among them
Entered the sacred portal. With loud and dissonant clangor
Echoed the sound of their brazen drums from ceiling and casement,—
Echoed a moment only, and slowly the ponderous portal
Closed, and in silence the crowd awaited the will of the soldiers.
Then uprose their commander, and spoke from the steps of the altar,
Holding aloft in his hands, with its seals, the royal commission.
""You are convened this day,"" he said, ""by his Majesty's orders.
Clement and kind has he been; but how you have answered his kindness,
Let your own hearts reply! To my natural make and my temper
Painful the task is I do, which to you I know must be grievous.
Yet must I bow and obey, and deliver the will of our monarch;
Namely, that all your lands, and dwellings, and cattle of all kinds
Forfeited be to the crown; and that you yourselves from this province
Be transported to other lands. God grant you may dwell there
Ever as faithful subjects, a happy and peaceable people!
Prisoners now I declare you; for such is his Majesty's pleasure!""
As, when the air is serene in the sultry solstice of summer,
Suddenly gathers a storm, and the deadly sling of the hailstones
Beats down the farmer's corn in the field and shatters his windows,
Hiding the sun, and strewing the ground with thatch from the house-roofs,
Bellowing fly the herds, and seek to break their enclosures;
So on the hearts of the people descended the words of the speaker.
Silent a moment they stood in speechless wonder, and then rose
Louder and ever louder a wail of sorrow and anger,
And, by one impulse moved, they madly rushed to the door-way.
Vain was the hope of escape; and cries and fierce imprecations
Rang through the house of prayer; and high o'er the heads of the others
Rose, with his arms uplifted, the figure of Basil the blacksmith,
As, on a stormy sea, a spar is tossed by the billows.
Flushed was his face and distorted with passion; and wildly he shouted,—
""Down with the tyrants of England! we never have sworn them allegiance!
Death to these foreign soldiers, who seize on our homes and our harvests!""
More he fain would have said, but the merciless hand of a soldier
Smote him upon the mouth, and dragged him down to the pavement.
In the midst of the strife and tumult of angry contention,
Lo! the door of the chancel opened, and Father Felician
Entered, with serious mien, and ascended the steps of the altar.
Raising his reverend hand, with a gesture he awed into silence
All that clamorous throng; and thus he spake to his people;
Deep were his tones and solemn; in accents measured and mournful
Spake he, as, after the tocsin's alarum, distinctly the clock strikes.
""What is this that ye do, my children? what madness has seized you?
Forty years of my life have I labored among you, and taught you,
Not in word alone, but in deed, to love one another!
Is this the fruit of my toils, of my vigils and prayers and privations?
Have you so soon forgotten all lessons of love and forgiveness?
This is the house of the Prince of Peace, and would you profane it
Thus with violent deeds and hearts overflowing with hatred?
Lo! where the crucified Christ from his cross is gazing upon you!
See! in those sorrowful eyes what meekness and holy compassion!
Hark! how those lips still repeat the prayer, 'O Father, forgive them!'
Let us repeat that prayer in the hour when the wicked assail us,
Let us repeat it now, and say, 'O Father, forgive them!'""
Few were his words of rebuke, but deep in the hearts of his people
Sank they, and sobs of contrition succeeded the passionate outbreak,
While they repeated his prayer, and said, ""O Father, forgive them!""
Then came the evening service. The tapers gleamed from the altar.
Fervent and deep was the voice of the priest and the people responded,
Not with their lips alone, but their hearts; and the Ave Maria
Sang they, and fell on their knees, and their souls, with devotion translated,
Rose on the ardor of prayer, like Elijah ascending to heaven.
Meanwhile had spread in the village the tidings of ill, and on all sides
Wandered, wailing, from house to house the women and children.
Long at her father's door Evangeline stood, with her right hand
Shielding her eyes from the level rays of the sun, that, descending,
Lighted the village street with mysterious splendor, and roofed each
Peasant's cottage with golden thatch, and emblazoned its windows.
Long within had been spread the snow-white cloth on the table;
There stood the wheaten loaf, and the honey fragrant with wild-flowers;
There stood the tankard of ale, and the cheese fresh brought from the dairy;
And, at the head of the board, the great arm-chair of the farmer.
Thus did Evangeline wait at her father's door, as the sunset
Threw the long shadows of trees o'er the broad ambrosial meadows.
Ah! on her spirit within a deeper shadow had fallen,
And from the fields of her soul a fragrance celestial ascended,—
Charity, meekness, love, and hope, and forgiveness, and patience!
Then, all-forgetful of self, she wandered into the village,
Cheering with looks and words the mournful hearts of the women,
As o'er the darkening fields with lingering steps they departed,
Urged by their household cares, and the weary feet of their children.
Down sank the great red sun, and in golden, glimmering vapors
Veiled the light of his face, like the Prophet descending from Sinai.
Sweetly over the village the bell of the Angelus sounded.
Meanwhile, amid the gloom, by the church Evangeline lingered.
All was silent within; and in vain at the door and the windows
Stood she, and listened and looked, till, overcome by emotion,
""Gabriel!"" cried she aloud with tremulous voice; but no answer
Came from the graves of the dead, nor the gloomier grave of the living.
Slowly at length she returned to the tenantless house of her father.
Smouldered the fire on the hearth, on the board was the supper untasted,
Empty and drear was each room, and haunted with phantoms of terror.
Sadly echoed her step on the stair and the floor of her chamber.
In the dead of the night she heard the disconsolate rain fall
Loud on the withered leaves of the sycamore-tree by the window.
Keenly the lightning flashed; and the voice of the echoing thunder
Told her that God was in heaven, and governed the world he created!
Then she remembered the tale she had heard of the justice of Heaven;
Soothed was her troubled soul, and she peacefully slumbered till morning.
Canto V
Four times the sun had risen and set; and now on the fifth day
Cheerily called the cock to the sleeping maids of the farm-house.
Soon o'er the yellow fields, in silent and mournful procession,
Came from the neighboring hamlets and farms the Acadian women,
Driving in ponderous wains their household goods to the sea-shore,
Pausing and looking back to gaze once more on their dwellings,
Ere they were shut from sight by the winding road and the woodland.
Close at their sides their children ran, and urged on the oxen,
While in their little hands they clasped some fragments of playthings.
Thus to the Gaspereau's mouth they hurried; and there on the sea-beach
Piled in confusion lay the household goods of the peasants.
All day long between the shore and the ships did the boats ply;
All day long the wains came laboring down from the village.
Late in the afternoon, when the sun was near to his setting,
Echoed far o'er the fields came the roll of drums from the churchyard.
Thither the women and children thronged. On a sudden the church-doors
Opened, and forth came the guard, and marching in gloomy procession
Followed the long-imprisoned, but patient, Acadian farmers.
Even as pilgrims, who journey afar from their homes and their country,
Sing as they go, and in singing forget they are weary and wayworn,
So with songs on their lips the Acadian peasants descended
Down from the church to the shore, amid their wives and their daughters.
Foremost the young men came; and, raising together their voices,
Sang with tremulous lips a chant of the Catholic Missions:—
""Sacred heart of the Saviour! O inexhaustible fountain!
Fill our hearts this day with strength and submission and patience!""
Then the old men, as they marched, and the women that stood by the wayside
Joined in the sacred psalm, and the birds in the sunshine above them
Mingled their notes therewith, like voices of spirits departed.
Half-way down to the shore Evangeline waited in silence,
Not overcome with grief, but strong in the hour of affliction,—
Calmly and sadly she waited, until the procession approached her,
And she beheld the face of Gabriel pale with emotion.
Tears then filled her eyes, and, eagerly running to meet him,
Clasped she his hands, and laid her head on his shoulder, and whispered,—
""Gabriel! be of good cheer! for if we love one another
Nothing, in truth, can harm us, whatever mischances may happen!""
Smiling she spake these words; then suddenly paused, for her father
Saw she slowly advancing. Alas! how changed was his aspect!
Gone was the glow from his cheek, and the fire from his eye, and his footstep
Heavier seemed with the weight of the heavy heart in his bosom.
But with a smile and a sigh, she clasped his neck and embraced him,
Speaking words of endearment where words of comfort availed not.
Thus to the Gaspereau's mouth moved on that mournful procession.
There disorder prevailed, and the tumult and stir of embarking.
Busily plied the freighted boats; and in the confusion
Wives were torn from their husbands, and mothers, too late, saw their children
Left on the land, extending their arms, with wildest entreaties.
So unto separate ships were Basil and Gabriel carried,
While in despair on the shore Evangeline stood with her father.
Half the task was not done when the sun went down, and the twilight
Deepened and darkened around; and in haste the refluent ocean
Fled away from the shore, and left the line of the sand-beach
Covered with waifs of the tide, with kelp and the slippery sea-weed.
Farther back in the midst of the household goods and the wagons,
Like to a gypsy camp, or a leaguer after a battle,
All escape cut off by the sea, and the sentinels near them,
Lay encamped for the night the houseless Acadian farmers.
Back to its nethermost caves retreated the bellowing ocean,
Dragging adown the beach the rattling pebbles, and leaving
Inland and far up the shore the stranded boats of the sailors.
Then, as the night descended, the herds returned from their pastures;
Sweet was the moist still air with the odor of milk from their udders;
Lowing they waited, and long, at the well-known bars of the farm-yard,—
Waited and looked in vain for the voice and the hand of the milkmaid.
Silence reigned in the streets; from the church no Angelus sounded,
Rose no smoke from the roofs, and gleamed no lights from the windows.
But on the shores meanwhile the evening fires had been kindled,
Built of the drift-wood thrown on the sands from wrecks in the tempest.
Round them shapes of gloom and sorrowful faces were gathered,
Voices of women were heard, and of men, and the crying of children.
Onward from fire to fire, as from hearth to hearth in his parish,
Wandered the faithful priest, consoling and blessing and cheering,
Like unto shipwrecked Paul on Melita's desolate sea-shore.
Thus he approached the place where Evangeline sat with her father,
And in the flickering light beheld the face of the old man,
Haggard and hollow and wan, and without either thought or emotion,
E'en as the face of a clock from which the hands have been taken.
Vainly Evangeline strove with words and caresses to cheer him,
Vainly offered him food; yet he moved not, he looked not, he spake not
But, with a vacant stare, ever gazed at the flickering fire-light.
""Benedicite!"" murmured the priest, in tones of compassion.
More he fain would have said, but his heart was full, and his accents
Faltered and paused on his lips, as the feet of a child on a threshold,
Hushed by the scene he beholds, and the awful presence of sorrow.
Silently, therefore, he laid his hand on the head of the maiden,
Raising his tearful eyes to the silent stars that above them
Moved on their way, unperturbed by the wrongs and sorrows of mortals.
Then sat he down at her side, and they wept together in silence.
Suddenly rose from the south a light, as in autumn the blood-red
Moon climbs the crystal walls of heaven, and o'er the horizon
Titan-like stretches its hundred hands upon mountain and meadow,
Seizing the rocks and the rivers, and piling huge shadows together.
Broader and ever broader it gleamed on the roofs of the village,
Gleamed on the sky and the sea, and the ships that lay in the roadstead.
Columns of shining smoke uprose, and flashes of flame were
Thrust through their folds and withdrawn, like the quivering hands of a martyr.
Then as the wind seized the gleeds and the burning thatch, and, uplifting,
Whirled them aloft through the air, at once from a hundred house-tops
Started the sheeted smoke with flashes of flame intermingled.
These things beheld in dismay the crowd on the shore and on shipboard.
Speechless at first they stood, then cried aloud in their anguish,
""We shall behold no more our homes in the village of Grand-Pré!""
Loud on a sudden the cocks began to crow in the farm-yards,
Thinking the day had dawned; and anon the lowing of cattle
Came on the evening breeze, by the barking of dogs interrupted.
Then rose a sound of dread, such as startles the sleeping encampments
Far in the western prairies or forests that skirt the Nebraska,
When the wild horses affrighted sweep by with the speed of the whirlwind,
Or the loud bellowing herds of buffaloes rush to the river.
Such was the sound that arose on the night, as the herds and the horses
Broke through their folds and fences, and madly rushed o'er the meadows.
Overwhelmed with the sight, yet speechless, the priest and the maiden
Gazed on the scene of terror that reddened and widened before them;
And as they turned at length to speak to their silent companion,
Lo! from his seat he had fallen, and stretched abroad on the sea-shore
Motionless lay his form, from which the soul had departed.
Slowly the priest uplifted the lifeless head, and the maiden
Knelt at her father's side, and wailed aloud in her terror.
Then in a swoon she sank, and lay with her head on his bosom.
Through the long night she lay in deep, oblivious slumber;
And when she woke from the trance, she beheld a multitude near her.
Faces of friends she beheld, that were mournfully gazing upon her,
Pallid, with tearful eyes, and looks of saddest compassion.
Still the blaze of the burning village illumined the landscape,
Reddened the sky overhead, and gleamed on the faces around her,
And like the day of doom it seemed to her wavering senses.
Then a familiar voice she heard, as it said to the people,—
""Let us bury him here by the sea. When a happier season
Brings us again to our homes from the unknown land of our exile,
Then shall his sacred dust be piously laid in the churchyard.""
Such were the words of the priest. And there in haste by the sea-side,
Having the glare of the burning village for funeral torches,
But without bell or book, they buried the farmer of Grand-Pré.
And as the voice of the priest repeated the service of sorrow,
Lo! with a mournful sound, like the voice of a vast congregation,
Solemnly answered the sea, and mingled its roar with the dirges.
'T was the returning tide, that afar from the waste of the ocean,
With the first dawn of the day, came heaving and hurrying landward.
Then recommenced once more the stir and noise of embarking;
And with the ebb of the tide the ships sailed out of the harbor,
Leaving behind them the dead on the shore, and the village in ruins.
Part the Second
Canto I
Many a weary year had passed since the burning of Grand-Pré,
When on the falling tide the freighted vessels departed,
Bearing a nation, with all its household gods, into exile.
Exile without an end, and without an example in story.
Far asunder, on separate coasts, the Acadians landed;
Scattered were they, like flakes of snow, when the wind from the northeast
Strikes aslant through the fogs that darken the Banks of Newfoundland.
Friendless, homeless, hopeless, they wandered from city to city,
From the cold lakes of the North to sultry Southern savannas,—
From the bleak shores of the sea to the lands where the Father of Waters
Seizes the hills in his hands, and drags them down to the ocean,
Deep in their sands to bury the scattered bones of the mammoth.
Friends they sought and homes; and many, despairing, heart-broken,
Asked of the earth but a grave, and no longer a friend nor a fireside.
Written their history stands on tablets of stone in the churchyards.
Long among them was seen a maiden who waited and wandered,
Lowly and meek in spirit, and patiently suffering all things.
Fair was she and young; but, alas! before her extended,
Dreary and vast and silent, the desert of life, with its pathway
Marked by the graves of those who had sorrowed and suffered before her,
Passions long extinguished, and hopes long dead and abandoned,
As the emigrant's way o'er the Western desert is marked by
Camp-fires long consumed, and bones that bleach in the sunshine.
Something there was in her life incomplete, imperfect, unfinished;
As if a morning of June, with all its music and sunshine,
Suddenly paused in the sky, and, fading, slowly descended
Into the east again, from whence it late had arisen.
Sometimes she lingered in towns, till, urged by the fever within her,
Urged by a restless longing, the hunger and thirst of the spirit,
She would commence again her endless search and endeavor;
Sometimes in churchyards strayed, and gazed on the crosses and tombstones,
Sat by some nameless grave, and thought that perhaps in its bosom
He was already at rest, and she longed to slumber beside him.
Sometimes a rumor, a hearsay, an inarticulate whisper,
Came with its airy hand to point and beckon her forward.
Sometimes she spake with those who had seen her beloved and known him,
But it was long ago, in some far-off place or forgotten.
""Gabriel Lajeunesse!"" they said; yes! we have seen him.
He was with Basil the blacksmith, and both have gone to the prairies;
Coureurs-des-Bois are they, and famous hunters and trappers.""
""Gabriel Lajeunesse!"" said others; ""O yes! we have seen him.
He is a Voyageur in the lowlands of Louisiana.""
Then would they say,—""Dear child! why dream and wait for him longer?
Are there not other youths as fair as Gabriel? others
Who have hearts as tender and true, and spirits as loyal?
Here is Baptiste Leblanc, the notary's son, who has loved thee
Many a tedious year; come, give him thy hand and be happy!
Thou art too fair to be left to braid St. Catherine's tresses.""
Then would Evangeline answer, serenely but sadly, ""I cannot!—
Whither my heart has gone, there follows my hand, and not elsewhere.
For when the heart goes before, like a lamp, and illumines the pathway,
Many things are made clear, that else lie hidden in darkness.""
Thereupon the priest, her friend and father-confessor,
Said, with a smile,—""O daughter! thy God thus speaketh within thee!
Talk not of wasted affection, affection never was wasted;
If it enrich not the heart of another, its waters, returning
Back to their springs, like the rain, shall fill them full of refreshment;
That which the fountain sends forth returns again to the fountain.
Patience; accomplish thy labor; accomplish thy work of affection!
Sorrow and silence are strong, and patient endurance is godlike.
Therefore accomplish thy labor of love, till the heart is made godlike,
Purified, strengthened, perfected, and rendered more worthy of heaven!""
Cheered by the good man's words, Evangeline labored and waited.
Still in her heart she heard the funeral dirge of the ocean,
But with its sound there was mingled a voice that whispered, ""Despair not!""
Thus did that poor soul wander in want and cheerless discomfort
Bleeding, barefooted, over the shards and thorns of existence.
Let me essay, O Muse! to follow the wanderer's footsteps;—
Not through each devious path, each changeful year of existence;
But as a traveller follows a streamlet's course through the valley:
Far from its margin at times, and seeing the gleam of its water
Here and there, in some open space, and at intervals only;
Then drawing nearer its banks, through sylvan glooms that conceal it,
Though he behold it not, he can hear its continuous murmur;
Happy, at length, if he find the spot where it reaches an outlet.
Canto II
It was the month of May. Far down the Beautiful River,
Past the Ohio shore and past the mouth of the Wabash,
Into the golden stream of the broad and swift Mississippi,
Floated a cumbrous boat, that was rowed by Acadian boatmen.
It was a band of exiles: a raft, as it were, from the shipwrecked
Nation, scattered along the coast, now floating together,
Bound by the bonds of a common belief and a common misfortune;
Men and women and children, who, guided by hope or by hearsay,
Sought for their kith and their kin among the few-acred farmers
On the Acadian coast, and the prairies of fair Opelousas.
With them Evangeline went, and her guide, the Father Felician.
Onward o'er sunken sands, through a wilderness sombre with forests,
Day after day they glided adown the turbulent river;
Night after night, by their blazing fires, encamped on its borders.
Now through rushing chutes, among green islands, where plumelike
Cotton-trees nodded their shadowy crests, they swept with the current,
Then emerged into broad lagoons, where silvery sand-bars
Lay in the stream, and along the wimpling waves of their margin,
Shining with snow-white plumes, large flocks of pelicans waded.
Level the landscape grew, and along the shores of the river,
Shaded by china-trees, in the midst of luxuriant gardens,
Stood the houses of planters, with negro-cabins and dove-cots.
They were approaching the region where reigns perpetual summer,
Where through the Golden Coast, and groves of orange and citron,
Sweeps with majestic curve the river away to the eastward.
They, too, swerved from their course; and, entering the Bayou of Plaquemine,
Soon were lost in a maze of sluggish and devious waters,
Which, like a network of steel, extended in every direction.
Over their heads the towering and tenebrous boughs of the cypress
Met in a dusky arch, and trailing mosses in mid-air
Waved like banners that hang on the walls of ancient cathedrals.
Deathlike the silence seemed, and unbroken, save by the herons
Home to their roosts in the cedar-trees returning at sunset,
Or by the owl, as he greeted the moon with demoniac laughter.
Lovely the moonlight was as it glanced and gleamed on the water,
Gleamed on the columns of cypress and cedar sustaining the arches,
Down through whose broken vaults it fell as through chinks in a ruin.
Dreamlike, and indistinct, and strange were all things around them;
And o'er their spirits there came a feeling of wonder and sadness,—
Strange forebodings of ill, unseen and that cannot be compassed.
As, at the tramp of a horse's hoof on the turf of the prairies,
Far in advance are closed the leaves of the shrinking mimosa,
So, at the hoof-beats of fate, with sad forebodings of evil,
Shrinks and closes the heart, ere the stroke of doom has attained it.
But Evangeline's heart was sustained by a vision, that faintly
Floated before her eyes, and beckoned her on through the moonlight.
It was the thought of her brain that assumed the shape of a phantom.
Through those shadowy aisles had Gabriel wandered before her,
And every stroke of the oar now brought him nearer and nearer.
Then in his place, at the prow of the boat, rose one of the oarsmen,
And, as a signal sound, if others like them peradventure
Sailed on those gloomy and midnight streams, blew a blast on his bugle.
Wild through the dark colonnades and corridors leafy the blast rang,
Breaking the seal of silence, and giving tongues to the forest.
Soundless above them the banners of moss just stirred to the music.
Multitudinous echoes awoke and died in the distance,
Over the watery floor, and beneath the reverberant branches;
But not a voice replied; no answer came from the darkness;
And, when the echoes had ceased, like a sense of pain was the silence.
Then Evangeline slept; but the boatmen rowed through the midnight,
Silent at times, then singing familiar Canadian boat-songs,
Such as they sang of old on their own Acadian rivers,
While through the night were heard the mysterious sounds of the desert,
Far off,—indistinct,—as of wave or wind in the forest,
Mixed with the whoop of the crane and the roar of the grim alligator.
Thus ere another noon they emerged from the shades; and before them
Lay, in the golden sun, the lakes of the Atchafalaya.
Water-lilies in myriads rocked on the slight undulations
Made by the passing oars, and, resplendent in beauty, the lotus
Lifted her golden crown above the heads of the boatmen.
Faint was the air with the odorous breath of magnolia blossoms,
And with the heat of noon; and numberless sylvan islands,
Fragrant and thickly embowered with blossoming hedges of roses,
Near to whose shores they glided along, invited to slumber.
Soon by the fairest of these their weary oars were suspended.
Under the boughs of Wachita willows, that grew by the margin,
Safely their boat was moored; and scattered about on the greensward,
Tired with their midnight toil, the weary travellers slumbered.
Over them vast and high extended the cope of a cedar.
Swinging from its great arms, the trumpet-flower and the grapevine
Hung their ladder of ropes aloft like the ladder of Jacob,
On whose pendulous stairs the angels ascending, descending,
Were the swift humming-birds, that flitted from blossom to blossom.
Such was the vision Evangeline saw as she slumbered beneath it.
Filled was her heart with love, and the dawn of an opening heaven
Lighted her soul in sleep with the glory of regions celestial.
Nearer, ever nearer, among the numberless islands,
Darted a light, swift boat, that sped away o'er the water,
Urged on its course by the sinewy arms of hunters and trappers.
Northward its prow was turned, to the land of the bison and beaver.
At the helm sat a youth, with countenance thoughtful and careworn.
Dark and neglected locks overshadowed his brow, and a sadness
Somewhat beyond his years on his face was legibly written.
Gabriel was it, who, weary with waiting, unhappy and restless,
Sought in the Western wilds oblivion of self and of sorrow.
Swiftly they glided along, close under the lee of the island,
But by the opposite bank, and behind a screen of palmettos,
So that they saw not the boat, where it lay concealed in the willows,
All undisturbed by the dash of their oars, and unseen, were the sleepers,
Angel of God was there none to awaken the slumbering maiden.
Swiftly they glided away, like the shade of a cloud on the prairie.
After the sound of their oars on the tholes had died in the distance,
As from a magic trance the sleepers awoke, and the maiden
Said with a sigh to the friendly priest,—""O Father Felician!
Something says in my heart that near me Gabriel wanders.
Is it a foolish dream, an idle and vague superstition?
Or has an angel passed, and revealed the truth to my spirit?""
Then, with a blush, she added,—""Alas for my credulous fancy!
Unto ears like thine such words as these have no meaning.""
But made answer the reverend man, and he smiled as he answered,—
""Daughter, thy words are not idle; nor are they to me without meaning.
Feeling is deep and still; and the word that floats on the surface
Is as the tossing buoy, that betrays where the anchor is hidden.
Therefore trust to thy heart, and to what the world calls illusions.
Gabriel truly is near thee; for not far away to the southward,
On the banks of the Teche, are the towns of St. Maur and St. Martin.
There the long-wandering bride shall be given again to her bridegroom,
There the long-absent pastor regain his flock and his sheepfold.
Beautiful is the land, with its prairies and forests of fruit-trees;
Under the feet a garden of flowers, and the bluest of heavens
Bending above, and resting its dome on the walls of the forest.
They who dwell there have named it the Eden of Louisiana.""
With these words of cheer they arose and continued their journey.
Softly the evening came. The sun from the western horizon
Like a magician extended his golden wand o'er the landscape;
Twinkling vapors arose; and sky and water and forest
Seemed all on fire at the touch, and melted and mingled together.
Hanging between two skies, a cloud with edges of silver,
Floated the boat, with its dripping oars, on the motionless water.
Filled was Evangeline's heart with inexpressible sweetness.
Touched by the magic spell, the sacred fountains of feeling
Glowed with the light of love, as the skies and waters around her.
Then from a neighboring thicket the mocking-bird, wildest of singers,
Swinging aloft on a willow spray that hung o'er the water,
Shook from his little throat such floods of delirious music,
That the whole air and the woods and the waves seemed silent to listen.
Plaintive at first were the tones and sad; then soaring to madness
Seemed they to follow or guide the revel of frenzied Bacchantes.
Single notes were then heard, in sorrowful, low lamentation;
Till, having gathered them all, he flung them abroad in derision,
As when, after a storm, a gust of wind through the tree-tops
Shakes down the rattling rain in a crystal shower on the branches.
With such a prelude as this, and hearts that throbbed with emotion,
Slowly they entered the Teche, where it flows through the green Opelousas,
And, through the amber air, above the crest of the woodland,
Saw the column of smoke that arose from a neighboring dwelling;—
Sounds of a horn they heard, and the distant lowing of cattle.
Canto III
Near to the bank of the river, o'ershadowed by oaks, from whose branches
Garlands of Spanish moss and of mystic mistletoe flaunted,
Such as the Druids cut down with golden hatchets at Yule-tide,
Stood, secluded and still, the house of the herdsman. A garden
Girded it round about with a belt of luxuriant blossoms,
Filling the air with fragrance. The house itself was of timbers
Hewn from the cypress-tree, and carefully fitted together.
Large and low was the roof; and on slender columns supported,
Rose-wreathed, vine-encircled, a broad and spacious veranda,
Haunt of the humming-bird and the bee, extended around it.
At each end of the house, amid the flowers of the garden,
Stationed the dove-cots were, as love's perpetual symbol,
Scenes of endless wooing, and endless contentions of rivals.
Silence reigned o'er the place. The line of shadow and sunshine
Ran near the tops of the trees; but the house itself was in shadow,
And from its chimney-top, ascending and slowly expanding
Into the evening air, a thin blue column of smoke rose.
In the rear of the house, from the garden gate, ran a pathway
Through the great groves of oak to the skirts of the limitless prairie,
Into whose sea of flowers the sun was slowly descending.
Full in his track of light, like ships with shadowy canvas
Hanging loose from their spars in a motionless calm in the tropics,
Stood a cluster of trees, with tangled cordage of grapevines.
Just where the woodlands met the flowery surf of the prairie,
Mounted upon his horse, with Spanish saddle and stirrups,
Sat a herdsman, arrayed in gaiters and doublet of deerskin.
Broad and brown was the face that from under the Spanish sombrero
Gazed on the peaceful scene, with the lordly look of its master.
Round about him were numberless herds of kine, that were grazing
Quietly in the meadows, and breathing the vapory freshness
That uprose from the river, and spread itself over the landscape.
Slowly lifting the horn that hung at his side, and expanding
Fully his broad, deep chest, he blew a blast, that resounded
Wildly and sweet and far, through the still damp air of the evening.
Suddenly out of the grass the long white horns of the cattle
Rose like flakes of foam on the adverse currents of ocean.
Silent a moment they gazed, then bellowing rushed o'er the prairie,
And the whole mass became a cloud, a shade in the distance.
Then, as the herdsman turned to the house, through the gate of the garden
Saw he the forms of the priest and the maiden advancing to meet him.
Suddenly down from his horse he sprang in amazement, and forward
Rushed with extended arms and exclamations of wonder;
When they beheld his face, they recognized Basil the blacksmith.
Hearty his welcome was, as he led his guests to the garden.
There in an arbor of roses with endless question and answer
Gave they vent to their hearts, and renewed their friendly embraces,
Laughing and weeping by turns, or sitting silent and thoughtful.
Thoughtful, for Gabriel came not; and now dark doubts and misgivings
Stole o'er the maiden's heart; and Basil, somewhat embarrassed,
Broke the silence and said,—""If you came by the Atchafalaya,
How have you nowhere encountered my Gabriel's boat on the bayous?""
Over Evangeline's face at the words of Basil a shade passed.
Tears came into her eyes, and she said, with a tremulous accent,—
""Gone? is Gabriel gone?"" and, concealing her face on his shoulder,
All her o'erburdened heart gave way, and she wept and lamented.
Then the good Basil said,—and his voice grew blithe as he said it,—
""Be of good cheer, my child; it is only to-day he departed.
Foolish boy! he has left me alone with my herds and my horses.
Moody and restless grown, and tried and troubled, his spirit
Could no longer endure the calm of this quiet existence.
Thinking ever of thee, uncertain and sorrowful ever,
Ever silent, or speaking only of thee and his troubles,
He at length had become so tedious to men and to maidens,
Tedious even to me, that at length I bethought me, and sent him
Unto the town of Adayes to trade for mules with the Spaniards.
Thence he will follow the Indian trails to the Ozark Mountains,
Hunting for furs in the forests, on rivers trapping the beaver.
Therefore be of good cheer; we will follow the fugitive lover;
He is not far on his way, and the Fates and the streams are against him.
Up and away to-morrow, and through the red dew of the morning
We will follow him fast, and bring him back to his prison.""
Then glad voices were heard, and up from the banks of the river,
Borne aloft on his comrades' arms, came Michael the fiddler.
Long under Basil's roof had he lived like a god on Olympus,
Having no other care than dispensing music to mortals.
Far renowned was he for his silver locks and his fiddle.
""Long live Michael,"" they cried, ""our brave Acadian minstrel!""
As they bore him aloft in triumphal procession; and straightway
Father Felician advanced with Evangeline, greeting the old man
Kindly and oft, and recalling the past, while Basil, enraptured,
Hailed with hilarious joy his old companions and gossips,
Laughing loud and long, and embracing mothers and daughters.
Much they marvelled to see the wealth of the cidevant blacksmith,
All his domains and his herds, and his patriarchal demeanor;
Much they marvelled to hear his tales of the soil and the climate,
And of the prairie; whose numberless herds were his who would take them;
Each one thought in his heart, that he, too, would go and do likewise.
Thus they ascended the steps, and, crossing the breezy veranda,
Entered the hall of the house, where already the supper of Basil
Waited his late return; and they rested and feasted together.
Over the joyous feast the sudden darkness descended.
All was silent without, and, illuming the landscape with silver,
Fair rose the dewy moon and the myriad stars; but within doors,
Brighter than these, shone the faces of friends in the glimmering lamplight.
Then from his station aloft, at the head of the table, the herdsman
Poured forth his heart and his wine together in endless profusion.
Lighting his pipe, that was filled with sweet Natchitoches tobacco,
Thus he spake to his guests, who listened, and smiled as they listened:—
""Welcome once more, my friends, who long have been friendless and homeless,
Welcome once more to a home, that is better perchance than the old one!
Here no hungry winter congeals our blood like the rivers;
Here no stony ground provokes the wrath of the farmer.
Smoothly the ploughshare runs through the soil, as a keel through the water.
All the year round the orange-groves are in blossom; and grass grows
More in a single night than a whole Canadian summer.
Here, too, numberless herds run wild and unclaimed in the prairies;
Here, too, lands may be had for the asking, and forests of timber
With a few blows of the axe are hewn and framed into houses.
After your houses are built, and your fields are yellow with harvests,
No King George of England shall drive you away from your homesteads,
Burning your dwellings and barns, and stealing your farms and your cattle.""
Speaking these words, he blew a wrathful cloud from his nostrils,
While his huge, brown hand came thundering down on the table,
So that the guests all started; and Father Felician, astounded,
Suddenly paused, with a pinch of snuff half-way to his nostrils.
But the brave Basil resumed, and his words were milder and gayer:—
""Only beware of the fever, my friends, beware of the fever!
For it is not like that of our cold Acadian climate,
Cured by wearing a spider hung round one's neck in a nutshell!""
Then there were voices heard at the door, and footsteps approaching
Sounded upon the stairs and the floor of the breezy veranda.
It was the neighboring Creoles and small Acadian planters,
Who had been summoned all to the house of Basil the Herdsman.
Merry the meeting was of ancient comrades and neighbors:
Friend clasped friend in his arms; and they who before were as strangers,
Meeting in exile, became straightway as friends to each other,
Drawn by the gentle bond of a common country together.
But in the neighboring hall a strain of music, proceeding
From the accordant strings of Michael's melodious fiddle,
Broke up all further speech. Away, like children delighted,
All things forgotten beside, they gave themselves to the maddening
Whirl of the dizzy dance, as it swept and swayed to the music,
Dreamlike, with beaming eyes and the rush of fluttering garments.
Meanwhile, apart, at the head of the hall, the priest and the herdsman
Sat, conversing together of past and present and future;
While Evangeline stood like one entranced, for within her
Olden memories rose, and loud in the midst of the music
Heard she the sound of the sea, and an irrepressible sadness
Came o'er her heart, and unseen she stole forth into the garden.
Beautiful was the night. Behind the black wall of the forest,
Tipping its summit with silver, arose the moon. On the river
Fell here and there through the branches a tremulous gleam of the moonlight,
Like the sweet thoughts of love on a darkened and devious spirit.
Nearer and round about her, the manifold flowers of the garden
Poured out their souls in odors, that were their prayers and confessions
Unto the night, as it went its way, like a silent Carthusian.
Fuller of fragrance than they, and as heavy with shadows and night-dews,
Hung the heart of the maiden. The calm and the magical moonlight
Seemed to inundate her soul with indefinable longing;
As, through the garden gate, and beneath the shade of the oak-trees,
Passed she along the path to the edge of the measureless prairie.
Silent it lay, with a silvery haze upon it, and fire-flies
Gleaming and floating away in mingled and infinite numbers.
Over her head the stars, the thoughts of God in the heavens,
Shone on the eyes of man who had ceased to marvel and worship,
Save when a blazing comet was seen on the walls of that temple,
As if a hand had appeared and written upon them, ""Upharsin.""
And the soul of the maiden, between the stars and the fire-flies,
Wandered alone, and she cried,—""O Gabriel! O my beloved!
Art thou so near unto me, and yet I cannot behold thee?
Art thou so near unto me, and yet thy voice does not reach me?
Ah! how often thy feet have trod this path to the prairie!
Ah! how often thine eyes have looked on the woodlands around me!
Ah! how often beneath this oak, returning from labor,
Thou hast lain down to rest and to dream of me in thy slumbers!
When shall these eyes behold, these arms be folded about thee?""
Loud and sudden and near the note of a whippoorwill sounded
Like a flute in the woods; and anon, through the neighboring thickets,
Farther and farther away it floated and dropped into silence.
""Patience!"" whispered the oaks from oracular caverns of darkness:
And, from the moonlit meadow, a sigh responded, ""To-morrow!""
Bright rose the sun next day; and all the flowers of the garden
Bathed his shining feet with their tears, and anointed his tresses
With the delicious balm that they bore in their vases of crystal.
""Farewell!"" said the priest, as he stood at the shadowy threshold;
""See that you bring us the Prodigal Son from his fasting and famine,
And, too, the Foolish Virgin, who slept when the bridegroom was coming.""
""Farewell!"" answered the maiden, and, smiling, with Basil descended
Down to the river's brink, where the boatmen already were waiting.
Thus beginning their journey with morning, and sunshine, and gladness,
Swiftly they followed the flight of him who was speeding before them,
Blown by the blast of fate like a dead leaf over the desert.
Not that day, nor the next, nor yet the day that succeeded,
Found they trace of his course, in lake or forest or river,
Nor, after many days, had they found him; but vague and uncertain
Rumors alone were their guides through a wild and desolate Country;
Till, at the little inn of the Spanish town of Adayes,
Weary and worn, they alighted, and learned from the garrulous landlord,
That on the day before, with horses and guides and companions,
Gabriel left the village, and took the road of the prairies.
Canto IV
Far in the West there lies a desert land, where the mountains
Lift, through perpetual snows, their lofty and luminous summits.
Down from their jagged, deep ravines, where the gorge, like a gateway,
Opens a passage rude to the wheels of the emigrant's wagon,
Westward the Oregon flows and the Walleway and Owyhee.
Eastward, with devious course, among the Wind-river Mountains,
Through the Sweet-water Valley precipitate leaps the Nebraska;
And to the south, from Fontaine-qui-bout and the Spanish sierras,
Fretted with sands and rocks, and swept by the wind of the desert,
Numberless torrents, with ceaseless sound, descend to the ocean,
Like the great chords of a harp, in loud and solemn vibrations.
Spreading between these streams are the wondrous, beautiful prairies,
Billowy bays of grass ever rolling in shadow and sunshine,
Bright with luxuriant clusters of roses and purple amorphas.
Over them wandered the buffalo herds, and the elk and the roebuck;
Over them wandered the wolves, and herds of riderless horses;
Fires that blast and blight, and winds that are weary with travel;
Over them wander the scattered tribes of Ishmael's children,
Staining the desert with blood; and above their terrible war-trails
Circles and sails aloft, on pinions majestic, the vulture,
Like the implacable soul of a chieftain slaughtered in battle,
By invisible stairs ascending and scaling the heavens.
Here and there rise smokes from the camps of these savage marauders;
Here and there rise groves from the margins of swift-running rivers;
And the grim, taciturn bear, the anchorite monk of the desert,
Climbs down their dark ravines to dig for roots by the brook-side,
And over all is the sky, the clear and crystalline heaven,
Like the protecting hand of God inverted above them.
Into this wonderful land, at the base of the Ozark Mountains,
Gabriel far had entered, with hunters and trappers behind him.
Day after day, with their Indian guides, the maiden and Basil
Followed his flying steps, and thought each day to o'ertake him.
Sometimes they saw, or thought they saw, the smoke of his camp-fire
Rise in the morning air from the distant plain; but at nightfall,
When they had reached the place, they found only embers and ashes.
And, though their hearts were sad at times and their bodies were weary,
Hope still guided them on, as the magic Fata Morgana
Showed them her lakes of light, that retreated and vanished before them.
Once, as they sat by their evening fire, there silently entered
Into the little camp an Indian woman, whose features
Wore deep traces of sorrow, and patience as great as her sorrow.
She was a Shawnee woman returning home to her people,
From the far-off hunting-grounds of the cruel Camanches,
Where her Canadian husband, a Coureur-des-Bois, had been murdered.
Touched were their hearts at her story, and warmest and friendliest welcome
Gave they, with words of cheer, and she sat and feasted among them
On the buffalo-meat and the venison cooked on the embers.
But when their meal was done, and Basil and all his companions,
Worn with the long day's march and the chase of the deer and the bison,
Stretched themselves on the ground, and slept where the quivering fire-light
Flashed on their swarthy cheeks, and their forms wrapped up in their blankets
Then at the door of Evangeline's tent she sat and repeated
Slowly, with soft, low voice, and the charm of her Indian accent,
All the tale of her love, with its pleasures, and pains, and reverses.
Much Evangeline wept at the tale, and to know that another
Hapless heart like her own had loved and had been disappointed.
Moved to the depths of her soul by pity and woman's compassion,
Yet in her sorrow pleased that one who had suffered was near her,
She in turn related her love and all its disasters.
Mute with wonder the Shawnee sat, and when she had ended
Still was mute; but at length, as if a mysterious horror
Passed through her brain, she spake, and repeated the tale of the Mowis;
Mowis, the bridegroom of snow, who won and wedded a maiden,
But, when the morning came, arose and passed from the wigwam,
Fading and melting away and dissolving into the sunshine,
Till she beheld him no more, though she followed far into the forest.
Then, in those sweet, low tones, that seemed like a weird incantation,
Told she the tale of the fair Lilinau, who was wooed by a phantom,
That, through the pines o'er her father's lodge, in the hush of the twilight,
Breathed like the evening wind, and whispered love to the maiden,
Till she followed his green and waving plume through the forest,
And nevermore returned, nor was seen again by her people.
Silent with wonder and strange surprise, Evangeline listened
To the soft flow of her magical words, till the region around her
Seemed like enchanted ground, and her swarthy guest the enchantress.
Slowly over the tops of the Ozark Mountains the moon rose,
Lighting the little tent, and with a mysterious splendor
Touching the sombre leaves, and embracing and filling the woodland.
With a delicious sound the brook rushed by, and the branches
Swayed and sighed overhead in scarcely audible whispers.
Filled with the thoughts of love was Evangeline's heart, but a secret,
Subtile sense crept in of pain and indefinite terror,
As the cold, poisonous snake creeps into the nest of the swallow.
It was no earthly fear. A breath from the region of spirits
Seemed to float in the air of night; and she felt for a moment
That, like the Indian maid, she, too, was pursuing a phantom.
With this thought she slept, and the fear and the phantom had vanished.
Early upon the morrow the march was resumed; and the Shawnee
Said, as they journeyed along,—""On the western slope of these mountains
Dwells in his little village the Black Robe chief of the Mission.
Much he teaches the people, and tells them of Mary and Jesus;
Loud laugh their hearts with joy, and weep with pain, as they hear him.""
Then, with a sudden and secret emotion, Evangeline answered,—
""Let us go to the Mission, for there good tidings await us!""
Thither they turned their steeds; and behind a spur of the mountains,
Just as the sun went down, they heard a murmur of voices,
And in a meadow green and broad, by the bank of a river,
Saw the tents of the Christians, the tents of the Jesuit Mission.
Under a towering oak, that stood in the midst of the village,
Knelt the Black Robe chief with his children. A crucifix fastened
High on the trunk of the tree, and overshadowed by grapevines,
Looked with its agonized face on the multitude kneeling beneath it.
This was their rural chapel. Aloft, through the intricate arches
Of its aerial roof, arose the chant of their vespers,
Mingling its notes with the soft susurrus and sighs of the branches.
Silent, with heads uncovered, the travellers, nearer approaching,
Knelt on the swarded floor, and joined in the evening devotions.
But when the service was done, and the benediction had fallen
Forth from the hands of the priest, like seed from the hands of the sower,
Slowly the reverend man advanced to the strangers, and bade them
Welcome; and when they replied, he smiled with benignant expression,
Hearing the homelike sounds of his mother-tongue in the forest,
And, with words of kindness, conducted them into his wigwam.
There upon mats and skins they reposed, and on cakes of the maize-ear
Feasted, and slaked their thirst from the water-gourd of the teacher.
Soon was their story told; and the priest with solemnity answered:—
""Not six suns have risen and set since Gabriel, seated
On this mat by my side, where now the maiden reposes,
Told me this same sad tale then arose and continued his journey!""
Soft was the voice of the priest, and he spake with an accent of kindness;
But on Evangeline's heart fell his words as in winter the snow-flakes
Fall into some lone nest from which the birds have departed.
""Far to the north he has gone,"" continued the priest; ""but in autumn,
When the chase is done, will return again to the Mission.""
Then Evangeline said, and her voice was meek and submissive,—
""Let me remain with thee, for my soul is sad and afflicted.""
So seemed it wise and well unto all; and betimes on the morrow,
Mounting his Mexican steed, with his Indian guides and companions.
Homeward Basil returned, and Evangeline stayed at the Mission.
  Slowly, slowly, slowly the days succeeded each other,
Days and weeks and months; and the fields of maize that were springing
Green from the ground when a stranger she came, now waving above her,
Lifted their slender shafts, with leaves interlacing, and forming
Cloisters for mendicant crows and granaries pillaged by squirrels.
Then in the golden weather the maize was husked, and the maidens
Blushed at each blood-red ear, for that betokened a lover,
But at the crooked laughed, and called it a thief in the corn-field.
Even the blood-red ear to Evangeline brought not her lover.
""Patience!"" the priest would say; ""have faith, and thy prayer will be answered!
Look at this vigorous plant that lifts its head from the meadow,
See how its leaves are turned to the north, as true as the magnet;
This is the compass-flower, that the finger of God has planted
Here in the houseless wild, to direct the traveller's journey
Over the sea-like, pathless, limitless waste of the desert.
Such in the soul of man is faith. The blossoms of passion,
Gay and luxuriant flowers, are brighter and fuller of fragrance,
But they beguile us, and lead us astray, and their odor is deadly.
Only this humble plant can guide us here, and hereafter
Crown us with asphodel flowers, that are wet with the dews of nepenthe.""
  So came the autumn, and passed, and the winter,—yet Gabriel came not;
Blossomed the opening spring, and the notes of the robin and bluebird
Sounded sweet upon wold and in wood, yet Gabriel came not.
But on the breath of the summer winds a rumor was wafted
Sweeter than song of bird, or hue or odor of blossom.
Far to the north and east, it said, in the Michigan forests,
Gabriel had his lodge by the banks of the Saginaw River,
And, with returning guides, that sought the lakes of St. Lawrence,
Saying a sad farewell, Evangeline went from the Mission.
When over weary ways, by long and perilous marches,
She had attained at length the depths of the Michigan forests,
Found she the hunter's lodge deserted and fallen to ruin!
Thus did the long sad years glide on, and in seasons and places
Divers and distant far was seen the wandering maiden;—
Now in the Tents of Grace of the meek Moravian Missions,
Now in the noisy camps and the battle-fields of the army,
Now in secluded hamlets, in towns and populous cities.
Like a phantom she came, and passed away unremembered.
Fair was she and young, when in hope began the long journey;
Faded was she and old, when in disappointment it ended.
Each succeeding year stole something away from her beauty,
Leaving behind it, broader and deeper, the gloom and the shadow.
Then there appeared and spread faint streaks of gray o'er her forehead,
Dawn of another life, that broke o'er her earthy horizon,
As in the eastern sky the first faint streaks of the morning.
Canto V
In that delightful land which is washed by the Delaware's waters,
Guarding in sylvan shades the name of Penn the apostle,
Stands on the banks of its beautiful stream the city he founded.
There all the air is balm, and the peach is the emblem of beauty,
And the streets still re-echo the names of the trees of the forest,
As if they fain would appease the Dryads whose haunts they molested.
There from the troubled sea had Evangeline landed, an exile,
Finding among the children of Penn a home and a country.
There old Rene Leblanc had died; and when he departed,
Saw at his side only one of all his hundred descendants.
Something at least there was in the friendly streets of the city,
Something that spake to her heart, and made her no longer a stranger;
And her ear was pleased with the Thee and Thou of the Quakers,
For it recalled the past, the old Acadian country,
Where all men were equal, and all were brothers and sisters.
So, when the fruitless search, the disappointed endeavor,
Ended, to recommence no more upon earth, uncomplaining,
Thither, as leaves to the light, were turned her thoughts and her footsteps.
As from a mountain's top the rainy mists of the morning
Roll away, and afar we behold the landscape below us,
Sun-illumined, with shining rivers and cities and hamlets,
So fell the mists from her mind, and she saw the world far below her,
Dark no longer, but all illumined with love; and the pathway
Which she had climbed so far, lying smooth and fair in the distance.
Gabriel was not forgotten. Within her heart was his image,
Clothed in the beauty of love and youth, as last she beheld him,
Only more beautiful made by his deathlike silence and absence.
Into her thoughts of him time entered not, for it was not.
Over him years had no power; he was not changed, but transfigured;
He had become to her heart as one who is dead, and not absent;
Patience and abnegation of self, and devotion to others,
This was the lesson a life of trial and sorrow had taught her.
So was her love diffused, but, like to some odorous spices,
Suffered no waste nor loss, though filling the air with aroma.
Other hope had she none, nor wish in life, but to follow
Meekly, with reverent steps, the sacred feet of her Saviour.
Thus many years she lived as a Sister of Mercy; frequenting
Lonely and wretched roofs in the crowded lanes of the city,
Where distress and want concealed themselves from the sunlight,
Where disease and sorrow in garrets languished neglected.
Night after night, when the world was asleep, as the watchman repeated
Loud, through the gusty streets, that all was well in the city,
High at some lonely window he saw the light of her taper.
Day after day, in the gray of the dawn, as slow through the suburbs
Plodded the German farmer, with flowers and fruits for the market,
Met he that meek, pale face, returning home from its watchings.
Then it came to pass that a pestilence fell on the city,
Presaged by wondrous signs, and mostly by flocks of wild pigeons,
Darkening the sun in their flight, with naught in their craws but an acorn.
And, as the tides of the sea arise in the month of September,
Flooding some silver stream, till it spreads to a lake in the meadow,
So death flooded life, and, o'erflowing its natural margin,
Spread to a brackish lake, the silver stream of existence.
Wealth had no power to bribe, nor beauty to charm, the oppressor;
But all perished alike beneath the scourge of his anger;—
Only, alas! the poor, who had neither friends nor attendants,
Crept away to die in the almshouse, home of the homeless.
Then in the suburbs it stood, in the midst of meadows and woodlands;—
Now the city surrounds it; but still, with its gateway and wicket
Meek, in the midst of splendor, its humble walls seem to echo
Softly the words of the Lord:—""The poor ye always have with you.""
Thither, by night and by day, came the Sister of Mercy. The dying
Looked up into her face, and thought, indeed, to behold there
Gleams of celestial light encircle her forehead with splendor,
Such as the artist paints o'er the brows of saints and apostles,
Or such as hangs by night o'er a city seen at a distance.
Unto their eyes it seemed the lamps of the city celestial,
Into whose shining gates erelong their spirits would enter.
Thus, on a Sabbath morn, through the streets, deserted and silent,
Wending her quiet way, she entered the door of the almshouse.
Sweet on the summer air was the odor of flowers in the garden;
And she paused on her way to gather the fairest among them,
That the dying once more might rejoice in their fragrance and beauty.
Then, as she mounted the stairs to the corridors, cooled by the east-wind,
Distant and soft on her ear fell the chimes from the belfry of Christ Church,
While, intermingled with these, across the meadows were wafted
Sounds of psalms, that were sung by the Swedes in their church at Wicaco.
Soft as descending wings fell the calm of the hour on her spirit;
Something within her said,—""At length thy trials are ended"";
And, with light in her looks, she entered the chambers of sickness.
Noiselessly moved about the assiduous, careful attendants,
Moistening the feverish lip, and the aching brow, and in silence
Closing the sightless eyes of the dead, and concealing their faces,
Where on their pallets they lay, like drifts of snow by the roadside.
Many a languid head, upraised as Evangeline entered,
Turned on its pillow of pain to gaze while she passed, for her presence
Fell on their hearts like a ray of the sun on the walls of a prison.
And, as she looked around, she saw how Death, the consoler,
Laying his hand upon many a heart, had healed it forever.
Many familiar forms had disappeared in the night time;
Vacant their places were, or filled already by strangers.
Suddenly, as if arrested by fear or a feeling of wonder,
Still she stood, with her colorless lips apart, while a shudder
Ran through her frame, and, forgotten, the flowerets dropped from her fingers,
And from her eyes and cheeks the light and bloom of the morning.
Then there escaped from her lips a cry of such terrible anguish,
That the dying heard it, and started up from their pillows.
On the pallet before her was stretched the form of an old man.
Long, and thin, and gray were the locks that shaded his temples;
But, as he lay in the in morning light, his face for a moment
Seemed to assume once more the forms of its earlier manhood;
So are wont to be changed the faces of those who are dying.
Hot and red on his lips still burned the flush of the fever,
As if life, like the Hebrew, with blood had besprinkled its portals,
That the Angel of Death might see the sign, and pass over.
Motionless, senseless, dying, he lay, and his spirit exhausted
Seemed to be sinking down through infinite depths in the darkness,
Darkness of slumber and death, forever sinking and sinking.
Then through those realms of shade, in multiplied reverberations,
Heard he that cry of pain, and through the hush that succeeded
Whispered a gentle voice, in accents tender and saint-like,
""Gabriel! O my beloved!"" and died away into silence.
Then he beheld, in a dream, once more the home of his childhood;
Green Acadian meadows, with sylvan rivers among them,
Village, and mountain, and woodlands; and, walking under their shadow,
As in the days of her youth, Evangeline rose in his vision.
Tears came into his eyes; and as slowly he lifted his eyelids,
Vanished the vision away, but Evangeline knelt by his bedside.
Vainly he strove to whisper her name, for the accents unuttered
Died on his lips, and their motion revealed what his tongue would have spoken.
Vainly he strove to rise; and Evangeline, kneeling beside him,
Kissed his dying lips, and laid his head on her bosom.
Sweet was the light of his eyes; but it suddenly sank into darkness,
As when a lamp is blown out by a gust of wind at a casement.
All was ended now, the hope, and the fear, and the sorrow,
All the aching of heart, the restless, unsatisfied longing,
All the dull, deep pain, and constant anguish of patience!
And, as she pressed once more the lifeless head to her bosom,
Meekly she bowed her own, and murmured, ""Father, I thank thee!""
Still stands the forest primeval; but far away from its shadow,
Side by side, in their nameless graves, the lovers are sleeping.
Under the humble walls of the little Catholic churchyard,
In the heart of the city, they lie, unknown and unnoticed.
Daily the tides of life go ebbing and flowing beside them,
Thousands of throbbing hearts, where theirs are at rest and forever,
Thousands of aching brains, where theirs no longer are busy,
Thousands of toiling hands, where theirs have ceased from their labors,
Thousands of weary feet, where theirs have completed their journey!
Still stands the forest primeval; but under the shade of its branches
Dwells another race, with other customs and language.
Only along the shore of the mournful and misty Atlantic
Linger a few Acadian peasants, whose fathers from exile
Wandered back to their native land to die in its bosom.
In the fisherman's cot the wheel and the loom are still busy;
Maidens still wear their Norman caps and their kirtles of homespun,
And by the evening fire repeat Evangeline's story,
While from its rocky caverns the deep-voiced, neighboring ocean
Speaks, and in accents disconsolate answers the wail of the forest."
Silence,"My father used to say,
""Superior people never make long visits,
have to be shown Longfellow's grave
or the glass flowers at Harvard.
Self-reliant like the cat—
that takes its prey to privacy,
the mouse's limp tail hanging like a shoelace from its mouth—
they sometimes enjoy solitude,
and can be robbed of speech
by speech which has delighted them.
The deepest feeling always shows itself in silence;
not in silence, but restraint.""
Nor was he insincere in saying, ""Make my house your inn.""
Inns are not residences."
Having a Coke with You,"is even more fun than going to San Sebastian, Irún, Hendaye, Biarritz, Bayonne
or being sick to my stomach on the Travesera de Gracia in Barcelona
partly because in your orange shirt you look like a better happier St. Sebastian
partly because of my love for you, partly because of your love for yoghurt
partly because of the fluorescent orange tulips around the birches
partly because of the secrecy our smiles take on before people and statuary
it is hard to believe when I’m with you that there can be anything as still
as solemn as unpleasantly definitive as statuary when right in front of it
in the warm New York 4 o’clock light we are drifting back and forth
between each other like a tree breathing through its spectacles
and the portrait show seems to have no faces in it at all, just paint
you suddenly wonder why in the world anyone ever did them
                                                                                                              I look
at you and I would rather look at you than all the portraits in the world
except possibly for the Polish Rider occasionally and anyway it’s in the Frick
which thank heavens you haven’t gone to yet so we can go together for the first time
and the fact that you move so beautifully more or less takes care of Futurism
just as at home I never think of the Nude Descending a Staircase or
at a rehearsal a single drawing of Leonardo or Michelangelo that used to wow me
and what good does all the research of the Impressionists do them
when they never got the right person to stand near the tree when the sun sank
or for that matter Marino Marini when he didn’t pick the rider as carefully
as the horse
                               it seems they were all cheated of some marvelous experience
which is not going to go wasted on me which is why I’m telling you about it"
The Change,"The season turned like the page of a glossy fashion magazine. 
In the park the daffodils came up 
and in the parking lot, the new car models were on parade.

Sometimes I think that nothing really changes—

The young girls show the latest crop of tummies, 
        and the new president proves that he's a dummy.

But remember the tennis match we watched that year? 
Right before our eyes

some tough little European blonde 
pitted against that big black girl from Alabama, 
cornrowed hair and Zulu bangles on her arms, 
some outrageous name like Vondella Aphrodite—

We were just walking past the lounge 
     and got sucked in by the screen above the bar, 
and pretty soon 
we started to care about who won,

putting ourselves into each whacked return 
as the volleys went back and forth and back 
like some contest between 
the old world and the new,

and you loved her complicated hair 
and her to-hell-with-everybody stare, 
and I, 
         I couldn't help wanting
the white girl to come out on top, 
because she was one of my kind, my tribe, 
with her pale eyes and thin lips

and because the black girl was so big 
and so black, 
                        so unintimidated,

hitting the ball like she was driving the Emancipation Proclamation 
down Abraham Lincoln's throat, 
like she wasn't asking anyone's permission.

There are moments when history 
passes you so close 
                you can smell its breath, 
you can reach your hand out 
                                    and touch it on its flank,

and I don't watch all that much Masterpiece Theatre, 
but I could feel the end of an era there

in front of those bleachers full of people 
in their Sunday tennis-watching clothes

as that black girl wore down her opponent 
then kicked her ass good 
then thumped her once more for good measure

and stood up on the red clay court 
holding her racket over her head like a guitar.

And the little pink judge 
                          had to climb up on a box 
to put the ribbon on her neck, 
still managing to smile into the camera flash, 
even though everything was changing

and in fact, everything had already changed—

Poof, remember? It was the twentieth century almost gone, 
we were there,

and when we went to put it back where it belonged, 
it was past us 
and we were changed.
  Listen to Claudia Rankine respond to Hoagland's poem >"
Antigonish [I met a man who wasn't there],"Yesterday, upon the stair,
I met a man who wasn't there
He wasn't there again today
I wish, I wish he'd go away...
When I came home last night at three
The man was waiting there for me
But when I looked around the hall
I couldn't see him there at all!
Go away, go away, don't you come back any more!
Go away, go away, and please don't slam the door... (slam!)
Last night I saw upon the stair
A little man who wasn't there
He wasn't there again today
Oh, how I wish he'd go away..."
Besides the Autumn poets sing (131),"Besides the Autumn poets sing, 
A few prosaic days

Sharks in the Rivers,"We'll say unbelievable things 
to each other in the early morning— 
  
our blue coming up from our roots, 
our water rising in our extraordinary limbs. 
  
All night I dreamt of bonfires and burn piles 
and ghosts of men, and spirits 
behind those birds of flame. 
  
I cannot tell anymore when a door opens or closes, 
I can only hear the frame saying, Walk through. 
  
It is a short walkway— 
into another bedroom. 
  
Consider the handle. Consider the key. 
  
I say to a friend, how scared I am of sharks. 
  
How I thought I saw them in the creek 
across from my street. 
  
I once watched for them, holding a bundle 
of rattlesnake grass in my hand, 
shaking like a weak-leaf girl. 
  
She sends me an article from a recent National Geographic that says, 
  
Sharks bite fewer people each year than 
New Yorkers do, according to Health Department records. 
  
Then she sends me on my way. Into the City of Sharks. 
  
Through another doorway, I walk to the East River saying, 
  
Sharks are people too. 
Sharks are people too. 
Sharks are people too. 
  
I write all the things I need on the bottom 
of my tennis shoes. I say, Let's walk together. 
  
The sun behind me is like a fire. 
Tiny flames in the river's ripples. 
  
I say something to God, but he's not a living thing, 
so I say it to the river, I say, 
  
I want to walk through this doorway 
But without all those ghosts on the edge, 
I want them to stay here. 
I want them to go on without me. 
  
I want them to burn in the water."
"Romeo and Juliet, Act III, Scene II [Gallop apace, you fiery-footed steeds]","Juliet waits for nightfall when Romeo will return.

Juliet: Gallop apace, you fiery-footed steeds,
Towards Phoebus' lodging: such a waggoner
As Phaethon would whip you to the west,
And bring in cloudy night immediately.
Spread thy close curtain, love-performing night,
That runaway's eyes may wink and Romeo
Leap to these arms, untalk'd of and unseen.
Lovers can see to do their amorous rites
By their own beauties; or, if love be blind,
It best agrees with night. Come, civil night,
Thou sober-suited matron, all in black,
And learn me how to lose a winning match,
Play'd for a pair of stainless maidenhoods.
Hood my unmann'd blood bating in my cheeks
With thy black mantle, till strange love grown bold
Think true love acted simple modesty.
Come, night, come, Romeo, come, thou day in night;
For thou wilt lie upon the wings of night
Whiter than new snow on a raven's back.
Come, gentle night, come, loving, black-brow'd night,
Give me my Romeo; and, when he shall die,
Take him and cut him out in little stars,
And he will make the face of heaven so fine
That all the world will be in love with night
And pay no worship to the garish sun.
O, I have bought the mansion of a love,
But not possess'd it, and, though I am sold,
Not yet enjoy'd: so tedious is this day
As is the night before some festival
To an impatient child that hath new robes
And may not wear them. O, here comes my nurse,
And she brings news, and every tongue that speaks
But Romeo's name speaks heavenly eloquence."
The Fish,"wade
through black jade.
       Of the crow-blue mussel-shells, one keeps
       adjusting the ash-heaps;
              opening and shutting itself like
an
injured fan.
       The barnacles which encrust the side
       of the wave, cannot hide
              there for the submerged shafts of the
sun,
split like spun
       glass, move themselves with spotlight swiftness
       into the crevices—
              in and out, illuminating
the
turquoise sea
       of bodies. The water drives a wedge
       of iron through the iron edge
              of the cliff; whereupon the stars,
pink
rice-grains, ink-
       bespattered jelly fish, crabs like green
       lilies, and submarine
              toadstools, slide each on the other.
All
external
       marks of abuse are present on this
       defiant edifice—
              all the physical features of
ac-

       of cornice, dynamite grooves, burns, and
       hatchet strokes, these things stand
              out on it; the chasm-side is
dead.
Repeated
       evidence has proved that it can live
       on what can not revive
              its youth. The sea grows old in it."
Dream-Land,"By a route obscure and lonely,
Haunted by ill angels only,
Where an Eidolon, named NIGHT,
On a black throne reigns upright,
I have reached these lands but newly
From an ultimate dim Thule—
From a wild clime that lieth, sublime,
            Out of SPACE— out of TIME.

Bottomless vales and boundless floods,
And chasms, and caves, and Titan woods,
With forms that no man can discover
For the tears that drip all over;
Mountains toppling evermore
Into seas without a shore;
Seas that restlessly aspire,
Surging, unto skies of fire;
Lakes that endlessly outspread
Their lone waters— lone and dead,—
Their still waters— still and chilly
With the snows of the lolling lily.

By the lakes that thus outspread
Their lone waters, lone and dead,—
Their sad waters, sad and chilly
With the snows of the lolling lily,—
By the mountains— near the river
Murmuring lowly, murmuring ever,—
By the grey woods,— by the swamp
Where the toad and the newt encamp—
By the dismal tarns and pools


     Where dwell the Ghouls,—
By each spot the most unholy—
In each nook most melancholy—
There the traveller meets aghast
Sheeted Memories of the Past—
Shrouded forms that start and sigh
As they pass the wanderer by—
White—robed forms of friends long given,
In agony, to the Earth— and Heaven.

For the heart whose woes are legion
'Tis a peaceful, soothing region—
For the spirit that walks in shadow
'Tis— oh, 'tis an Eldorado!
But the traveller, travelling through it,
May not— dare not openly view it!
Never its mysteries are exposed
To the weak human eye unclosed;
So wills its King, who hath forbid
The uplifting of the fringed lid;
And thus the sad Soul that here passes
Beholds it but through darkened glasses.

By a route obscure and lonely,
Haunted by ill angels only,
Where an Eidolon, named NIGHT,
On a black throne reigns upright,
I have wandered home but newly
From this ultimate dim Thule."
Childe Harold's Pilgrimage [There is a pleasure in the pathless woods],"   There is a pleasure in the pathless woods,
   There is a rapture on the lonely shore,
   There is society where none intrudes,
   By the deep Sea, and music in its roar:
   I love not Man the less, but Nature more,
   From these our interviews, in which I steal
   From all I may be, or have been before,
   To mingle with the Universe, and feel
What I can ne'er express, yet cannot all conceal.
   Roll on, thou deep and dark blue Ocean--roll!
   Ten thousand fleets sweep over thee in vain;
   Man marks the earth with ruin--his control
   Stops with the shore;--upon the watery plain
   The wrecks are all thy deed, nor doth remain
   A shadow of man's ravage, save his own,
   When for a moment, like a drop of rain,
   He sinks into thy depths with bubbling groan,
Without a grave, unknelled, uncoffined, and unknown.
   His steps are not upon thy paths,--thy fields
   Are not a spoil for him,--thou dost arise
   And shake him from thee; the vile strength he wields
   For earth's destruction thou dost all despise,
   Spurning him from thy bosom to the skies,
   And send'st him, shivering in thy playful spray
   And howling, to his gods, where haply lies
   His petty hope in some near port or bay,
And dashest him again to earth: —there let him lay."
Such Is the Sickness of Many a Good Thing,"Was he then Adam of the Burning Way? 
hid away in the heat like wrath 
        conceald in Love’s face, 
or the seed, Eris in Eros, 
        key and lock 
of what I was?        I could not speak 
        the releasing 
word.        For into a dark 
        matter he came 
and askt me to say what 
        I could not say.        ""I .."" 


All the flame in me stopt 
        against my tongue. 
My heart was a stone, a dumb 
        unmanageable thing in me, 
a darkness that stood athwart 
        his need 
for the enlightening, the 
        ""I love you"" that has 
only this one quick in time, 
        this one start 
when its moment is true. 


Such is the sickness of many a good thing 
that now into my life from long ago this 
refusing to say I love you has bound 
the weeping, the yielding, the 
        yearning to be taken again, 
into a knot, a waiting, a string 


so taut it taunts the song, 
it resists the touch. It grows dark 
to draw down the lover’s hand 
from its lightness to what’s 
        underground."
The Charge of the Light Brigade,"Half a league, half a league,
Half a league onward,
All in the valley of Death
Rode the six hundred.
""Forward, the Light Brigade!
Charge for the guns!"" he said:
Into the valley of Death
Rode the six hundred.

""Forward, the Light Brigade!""
Was there a man dismay’d?
Not tho’ the soldier knew
Some one had blunder’d:
Theirs not to make reply,
Theirs not to reason why,
Theirs but to do and die:
Into the valley of Death
Rode the six hundred.

Cannon to right of them,
Cannon to left of them,
Cannon in front of them
Volley’d and thunder’d;
Storm’d at with shot and shell,
Boldly they rode and well,
Into the jaws of Death,
Into the mouth of Hell
Rode the six hundred.

Flash’d all their sabres bare,
Flash’d as they turn’d in air
Sabring the gunners there,
Charging an army, while
All the world wonder’d:
Plunged in the battery-smoke
Right thro’ the line they broke;
Cossack and Russian
Reel’d from the sabre-stroke
Shatter’d and sunder’d.
Then they rode back, but not
Not the six hundred.

Cannon to right of them,
Cannon to left of them,
Cannon behind them
Volley’d and thunder’d;
Storm’d at with shot and shell,
While horse and hero fell,
They that had fought so well
Came thro’ the jaws of Death,
Back from the mouth of Hell,
All that was left of them,
Left of six hundred.

When can their glory fade?
O the wild charge they made!
All the world wonder’d.
Honor the charge they made!
Honor the Light Brigade,
Noble six hundred!"
If—,"If you can keep your head when all about you
   Are losing theirs and blaming it on you;
If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you,
   But make allowance for their doubting too;
If you can wait and not be tired by waiting,
   Or, being lied about, don’t deal in lies,
Or, being hated, don’t give way to hating,
   And yet don’t look too good, nor talk too wise;
If you can dream—and not make dreams your master;
   If you can think—and not make thoughts your aim;
If you can meet with triumph and disaster
   And treat those two impostors just the same;
If you can bear to hear the truth you’ve spoken
   Twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools,
Or watch the things you gave your life to broken,
   And stoop and build ’em up with wornout tools;
If you can make one heap of all your winnings
   And risk it on one turn of pitch-and-toss,
And lose, and start again at your beginnings
   And never breathe a word about your loss;
If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew
   To serve your turn long after they are gone,
And so hold on when there is nothing in you
   Except the Will which says to them: “Hold on”;
If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue,
   Or walk with kings—nor lose the common touch;
If neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you;
   If all men count with you, but none too much;
If you can fill the unforgiving minute
With sixty seconds’ worth of distance run—
   Yours is the Earth and everything that’s in it,
And—which is more—you’ll be a Man, my son!"
Do not go gentle into that good night,"Do not go gentle into that good night,
Old age should burn and rave at close of day;
Rage, rage against the dying of the light.

Though wise men at their end know dark is right,
Because their words had forked no lightning they
Do not go gentle into that good night.

Good men, the last wave by, crying how bright
Their frail deeds might have danced in a green bay,
Rage, rage against the dying of the light.

Wild men who caught and sang the sun in flight,
And learn, too late, they grieved it on its way,
Do not go gentle into that good night.

Grave men, near death, who see with blinding sight
Blind eyes could blaze like meteors and be gay,
Rage, rage against the dying of the light.

And you, my father, there on the sad height,
Curse, bless, me now with your fierce tears, I pray.
Do not go gentle into that good night.
Rage, rage against the dying of the light."
This Is Just To Say,"I have eaten
the plums
that were in
the icebox
and which
you were probably
saving
for breakfast
Forgive me
they were delicious
so sweet
and so cold"
Her Kind,"I have gone out, a possessed witch,
haunting the black air, braver at night;
dreaming evil, I have done my hitch
over the plain houses, light by light:
lonely thing, twelve-fingered, out of mind.
A woman like that is not a woman, quite.
I have been her kind.
I have found the warm caves in the woods,
filled them with skillets, carvings, shelves,
closets, silks, innumerable goods;
fixed the suppers for the worms and the elves:
whining, rearranging the disaligned.
A woman like that is misunderstood.
I have been her kind.
I have ridden in your cart, driver,
waved my nude arms at villages going by,
learning the last bright routes, survivor
where your flames still bite my thigh
and my ribs crack where your wheels wind.
A woman like that is not ashamed to die.
I have been her kind."
Because I could not stop for Death (479),"Because I could not stop for Death—
He kindly stopped for me—
The Carriage held but just Ourselves— 
And Immortality.
We slowly drove—He knew no haste
And I had put away
My labor and my leisure too,
For His Civility—
We passed the School, where Children strove
At Recess—in the Ring—
We passed the Fields of Gazing Grain—
We passed the Setting Sun—
Or rather—He passed us—
The Dews drew quivering and chill—
For only Gossamer, my Gown—
My Tippet—only Tulle—
We paused before a House that seemed
A Swelling of the Ground—
The Roof was scarcely visible—
The Cornice—in the Ground—
Since then—’tis Centuries—and yet
Feels shorter than the Day
I first surmised the Horses’ Heads
Were toward Eternity—"
Ode to the West Wind,"  I
  O wild West Wind, thou breath of Autumn’s being,
Thou, from whose unseen presence the leaves dead
Are driven, like ghosts from an enchanter fleeing,
  Yellow, and black, and pale, and hectic red,
Pestilence-stricken multitudes: O thou,
Who chariotest to their dark wintry bed
The wingèd seeds, where they lie cold and low,
Each like a corpse within its grave, until
Thine azure sister of the Spring shall blow
Her clarion o’er the dreaming earth, and fill
(Driving sweet buds like flocks to feed in air)
With living hues and odours plain and hill:
Wild Spirit, which art moving everywhere;
Destroyer and Preserver; hear, O hear!
  II
  Thou on whose stream, ‘mid the steep sky’s commotion,
Loose clouds like Earth’s decaying leaves are shed,
Shook from the tangled boughs of Heaven and Ocean,
  Angels of rain and lightning: there are spread
On the blue surface of thine airy surge,
Like the bright hair uplifted from the head
Of some fierce Maenad, even from the dim verge
Of the horizon to the zenith’s height,
The locks of the approaching storm. Thou dirge
Of the dying year, to which this closing night
Will be the dome of a vast sepulchre
Vaulted with all thy congregated might
Of vapours, from whose solid atmosphere
Black rain, and fire, and hail will burst: O hear!
  III
  Thou who didst waken from his summer dreams
The blue Mediterranean, where he lay,
Lulled by the coil of his crystalline streams,
  Beside a pumice isle in Baiae’s bay,
And saw in sleep old palaces and towers
Quivering within the wave's intenser day,
All overgrown with azure moss and flowers
So sweet, the sense faints picturing them! Thou
For whose path the Atlantic’s level powers
Cleave themselves into chasms, while far below
The sea-blooms and the oozy woods which wear
The sapless foliage of the ocean, know
Thy voice, and suddenly grow grey with fear,
And tremble and despoil themselves: O hear!
  IV
  If I were a dead leaf thou mightest bear;
If I were a swift cloud to fly with thee;
A wave to pant beneath thy power, and share
  The impulse of thy strength, only less free
Than thou, O Uncontrollable! If even
I were as in my boyhood, and could be
The comrade of thy wanderings over Heaven,
As then, when to outstrip thy skiey speed
Scarce seemed a vision; I would ne’er have striven
As thus with thee in prayer in my sore need.
Oh! lift me as a wave, a leaf, a cloud!
I fall upon the thorns of life! I bleed!
A heavy weight of hours has chained and bowed
One too like thee: tameless, and swift, and proud.
  V
  Make me thy lyre, even as the forest is:
What if my leaves are falling like its own!
The tumult of thy mighty harmonies
  Will take from both a deep, autumnal tone,
Sweet though in sadness. Be thou, Spirit fierce,
My spirit! Be thou me, impetuous one!
Drive my dead thoughts over the universe
Like withered leaves to quicken a new birth!
And, by the incantation of this verse,
Scatter, as from an unextinguished hearth
Ashes and sparks, my words among mankind!
Be through my lips to unawakened Earth
The trumpet of a prophecy! O Wind,
If Winter comes, can Spring be far behind?"
Wanting to Die,"Since you ask, most days I cannot remember.
I walk in my clothing, unmarked by that voyage.
Then the almost unnameable lust returns.
Even then I have nothing against life.
I know well the grass blades you mention,
the furniture you have placed under the sun.
But suicides have a special language.
Like carpenters they want to know which tools.
They never ask why build.
Twice I have so simply declared myself,
have possessed the enemy, eaten the enemy,
have taken on his craft, his magic.
In this way, heavy and thoughtful,
warmer than oil or water,
I have rested, drooling at the mouth-hole.
I did not think of my body at needle point.
Even the cornea and the leftover urine were gone.
Suicides have already betrayed the body.
Still-born, they don't always die,
but dazzled, they can't forget a drug so sweet
that even children would look on and smile.
To thrust all that life under your tongue!--
that, all by itself, becomes a passion.
Death's a sad Bone; bruised, you'd say,
and yet she waits for me, year after year,
to so delicately undo an old wound,
to empty my breath from its bad prison.
Balanced there, suicides sometimes meet,
raging at the fruit, a pumped-up moon,
leaving the bread they mistook for a kiss,
leaving the page of the book carelessly open,
something unsaid, the phone off the hook
and the love, whatever it was, an infection."
How Do I Love Thee? (Sonnet 43),"How do I love thee? Let me count the ways.
I love thee to the depth and breadth and height
My soul can reach, when feeling out of sight
For the ends of being and ideal grace.
I love thee to the level of every day’s
Most quiet need, by sun and candle-light.
I love thee freely, as men strive for right.
I love thee purely, as they turn from praise.
I love thee with the passion put to use
In my old griefs, and with my childhood’s faith.
I love thee with a love I seemed to lose
With my lost saints. I love thee with the breath,
Smiles, tears, of all my life; and, if God choose,
I shall but love thee better after death."
Casey at the Bat,"The outlook wasn't brilliant for the Mudville nine that day:
The score stood four to two, with but one inning more to play,
And then when Cooney died at first, and Barrows did the same,
A pall-like silence fell upon the patrons of the game.
A straggling few got up to go in deep despair. The rest
Clung to the hope which springs eternal in the human breast;
They thought, ""If only Casey could but get a whack at that—
We'd put up even money now, with Casey at the bat.""
But Flynn preceded Casey, as did also Jimmy Blake,
And the former was a hoodoo, while the latter was a cake;
So upon that stricken multitude grim melancholy sat,
For there seemed but little chance of Casey getting to the bat.
But Flynn let drive a single, to the wonderment of all,
And Blake, the much despisèd, tore the cover off the ball;
And when the dust had lifted, and men saw what had occurred,
There was Jimmy safe at second and Flynn a-hugging third.
Then from five thousand throats and more there rose a lusty yell;
It rumbled through the valley, it rattled in the dell;
It pounded on the mountain and recoiled upon the flat,
For Casey, mighty Casey, was advancing to the bat.
There was ease in Casey's manner as he stepped into his place;
There was pride in Casey's bearing and a smile lit Casey's face.
And when, responding to the cheers, he lightly doffed his hat,
No stranger in the crowd could doubt 'twas Casey at the bat.
Ten thousand eyes were on him as he rubbed his hands with dirt;
Five thousand tongues applauded when he wiped them on his shirt;
Then while the writhing pitcher ground the ball into his hip,
Defiance flashed in Casey's eye, a sneer curled Casey's lip.
And now the leather-covered sphere came hurtling through the air,
And Casey stood a-watching it in haughty grandeur there.
Close by the sturdy batsman the ball unheeded sped—
""That ain't my style,"" said Casey. ""Strike one!"" the umpire said.
From the benches, black with people, there went up a muffled roar,
Like the beating of the storm-waves on a stern and distant shore;
""Kill him! Kill the umpire!"" shouted someone on the stand;
And it's likely they'd have killed him had not Casey raised his hand.
With a smile of Christian charity great Casey's visage shone;
He stilled the rising tumult; he bade the game go on;
He signaled to the pitcher, and once more the dun sphere flew;
But Casey still ignored it and the umpire said, ""Strike two!""
""Fraud!"" cried the maddened thousands, and echo answered ""Fraud!""
But one scornful look from Casey and the audience was awed.
They saw his face grow stern and cold, they saw his muscles strain,
And they knew that Casey wouldn't let that ball go by again.
The sneer is gone from Casey's lip, his teeth are clenched in hate,
He pounds with cruel violence his bat upon the plate;
And now the pitcher holds the ball, and now he lets it go,
And now the air is shattered by the force of Casey's blow.
Oh, somewhere in this favoured land the sun is shining bright,
The band is playing somewhere, and somewhere hearts are light;
And somewhere men are laughing, and somewhere children shout,
But there is no joy in Mudville—mighty Casey has struck out."
As I Walked Out One Evening,"As I walked out one evening,
   Walking down Bristol Street,
The crowds upon the pavement
   Were fields of harvest wheat.
And down by the brimming river
   I heard a lover sing
Under an arch of the railway:
   ‘Love has no ending.
‘I’ll love you, dear, I’ll love you
   Till China and Africa meet,
And the river jumps over the mountain
   And the salmon sing in the street,
‘I’ll love you till the ocean
   Is folded and hung up to dry
And the seven stars go squawking
   Like geese about the sky.
‘The years shall run like rabbits,
   For in my arms I hold
The Flower of the Ages,
   And the first love of the world.’
But all the clocks in the city
   Began to whirr and chime:
‘O let not Time deceive you,
   You cannot conquer Time.
‘In the burrows of the Nightmare
   Where Justice naked is,
Time watches from the shadow
   And coughs when you would kiss.
‘In headaches and in worry
   Vaguely life leaks away,
And Time will have his fancy
   To-morrow or to-day.
‘Into many a green valley
   Drifts the appalling snow;
Time breaks the threaded dances
   And the diver’s brilliant bow.
‘O plunge your hands in water,
   Plunge them in up to the wrist;
Stare, stare in the basin
   And wonder what you’ve missed.
‘The glacier knocks in the cupboard,
   The desert sighs in the bed,
And the crack in the tea-cup opens
   A lane to the land of the dead.
‘Where the beggars raffle the banknotes
   And the Giant is enchanting to Jack,
And the Lily-white Boy is a Roarer,
   And Jill goes down on her back.
‘O look, look in the mirror,
   O look in your distress:
Life remains a blessing
   Although you cannot bless.
‘O stand, stand at the window
   As the tears scald and start;
You shall love your crooked neighbour
   With your crooked heart.’
It was late, late in the evening,
   The lovers they were gone;
The clocks had ceased their chiming,
   And the deep river ran on."
On the Circuit,"Among pelagian travelers,
Lost on their lewd conceited way
To Massachusetts, Michigan,
Miami or L.A.,

An airborne instrument I sit,
Predestined nightly to fulfill
Columbia-Giesen-Management's
Unfathomable will,

By whose election justified,
I bring my gospel of the Muse
To fundamentalists, to nuns,
to Gentiles and to Jews,

And daily, seven days a week,
Before a local sense has jelled,
From talking-site to talking-site
Am jet-or-prop-propelled.

Though warm my welcome everywhere,
I shift so frequently, so fast,
I cannot now say where I was 
The evening before last,

Unless some singular event
Should intervene to save the place,
A truly asinine remark,
A soul-bewitching face,

Or blessed encounter, full of joy,
Unscheduled on the Giesen Plan,
With, here, an addict of Tolkien,
There, a Charles Williams fan.

Since Merit but a dunghill is,
I mount the rostrum unafraid:
Indeed, 'twere damnable to ask
If I am overpaid.

Spirit is willing to repeat
Without a qualm the same old talk,
But Flesh is homesick for our snug
Apartment in New York.

A sulky fifty-six, he finds
A change of mealtime utter hell,
Grown far too crotchety to like
A luxury hotel.

The Bible is a goodly book
I always can peruse with zest,
But really cannot say the same
For Hilton's Be My Guest.

Nor bear with equanimity
The radio in students' cars,
Muzak at breakfast, or--dear God!--
Girl-organists in bars.

Then, worst of all, the anxious thought,
Each time my plane begins to sink
And the No Smoking sign comes on:
What will there be to drink?

Is this a milieu where I must
How grahamgreeneish!  How infra dig!
Snatch from the bottle in my bag 
An analeptic swig?

Another morning comes: I see,
Dwindling below me on the plane,
The roofs of one more audience
I shall not see again.

God bless the lot of them, although
I don't remember which was which:
God bless the U.S.A., so large,
So friendly, and so rich."
Even the Rain,"What will suffice for a true-love knot? Even the rain?
But he has bought grief’s lottery, bought even the rain.
“Our glosses / wanting in this world”—“Can you remember?”
Anyone!—“when we thought / the poets taught” even the rain?
After we died—That was it!—God left us in the dark.
And as we forgot the dark, we forgot even the rain.
Drought was over. Where was I? Drinks were on the house.
For mixers, my love, you’d poured—what?—even the rain.
Of this pear-shaped orange’s perfumed twist, I will say:
Extract Vermouth from the bergamot, even the rain.
How did the Enemy love you—with earth? air? and fire?
He held just one thing back till he got even: the rain.
This is God’s site for a new house of executions?
You swear by the Bible, Despot, even the rain?
After the bones—those flowers—this was found in the urn:
The lost river, ashes from the ghat, even the rain.
What was I to prophesy if not the end of the world?
A salt pillar for the lonely lot, even the rain.
How the air raged, desperate, streaming the earth with flames—
To help burn down my house, Fire sought even the rain.
He would raze the mountains, he would level the waves;
he would, to smooth his epic plot, even the rain.
New York belongs at daybreak to only me, just me—
To make this claim Memory’s brought even the rain.
They’ve found the knife that killed you, but whose prints are these?
No one has such small hands, Shahid, not even the rain."
Out of the Cradle Endlessly Rocking,"Out of the cradle endlessly rocking,
Out of the mocking-bird’s throat, the musical shuttle,
Out of the Ninth-month midnight,
Over the sterile sands and the fields beyond, where the child leaving his bed wander’d alone, bareheaded, barefoot,
Down from the shower’d halo,
Up from the mystic play of shadows twining and twisting as if they were alive,
Out from the patches of briers and blackberries,
From the memories of the bird that chanted to me,
From your memories sad brother, from the fitful risings and fallings I heard,
From under that yellow half-moon late-risen and swollen as if with tears,
From those beginning notes of yearning and love there in the mist,
From the thousand responses of my heart never to cease,
From the myriad thence-arous’d words,
From the word stronger and more delicious than any,
From such as now they start the scene revisiting,
As a flock, twittering, rising, or overhead passing,
Borne hither, ere all eludes me, hurriedly,
A man, yet by these tears a little boy again,
Throwing myself on the sand, confronting the waves,
I, chanter of pains and joys, uniter of here and hereafter,
Taking all hints to use them, but swiftly leaping beyond them,
A reminiscence sing.
Once Paumanok,
When the lilac-scent was in the air and Fifth-month grass was growing,
Up this seashore in some briers,
Two feather’d guests from Alabama, two together,
And their nest, and four light-green eggs spotted with brown,
And every day the he-bird to and fro near at hand,
And every day the she-bird crouch’d on her nest, silent, with bright eyes,
And every day I, a curious boy, never too close, never disturbing them,
Cautiously peering, absorbing, translating.
Shine! shine! shine!
Pour down your warmth, great sun!
While we bask, we two together.
Two together!
Winds blow south, or winds blow north,
Day come white, or niqht come black,
Home, or rivers and mountains from home,
Singing all time, minding no time,
While we two keep together.
Till of a sudden,
May-be kill’d, unknown to her mate,
One forenoon the she-bird crouch’d not on the nest,
Nor return’d that afternoon, nor the next,
Nor ever appear’d again.
And thenceforward all summer in the sound of the sea,
And at night under the full of the moon in calmer weather,
Over the hoarse surging of the sea,
Or flitting from brier to brier by day,
I saw, I heard at intervals the remaining one, the he-bird,
The solitary guest from Alabama.
Blow! blow! blow!
Blow up sea-winds along Paumanok’s shore;
I wait and I wait till you blow my mate to me.
Yes, when the stars glisten’d,
All night long on the prong of a moss-scallop’d stake,
Down almost amid the slapping waves,
Sat the lone singer wonderful causing tears.
He call’d on his mate,
He pour’d forth the meanings which I of all men know.
Yes my brother I know,         
The rest might not, but I have treasur’d every note,
For more than once dimly down to the beach gliding,
Silent, avoiding the moonbeams, blending myself with the
shadows,
Recalling now the obscure shapes, the echoes, the sounds
and sights after their sorts,
The white arms out in the breakers tirelessly tossing,
I, with bare feet, a child, the wind wafting my hair,
Listen’d long and long.
Listen’d to keep, to sing, now translating the notes,
Following you my brother.
Soothe! soothe! soothe!
Close on its wave soothes the wave behind,  
And again another behind embracing and lapping, every one close,
But my love soothes not me, not me.  
Low hangs the moon, it rose late,
It is lagging—O I think it is heavy with love, with love.
O madly the sea pushes upon the land,
With love, with love.
O night! do I not see my love fluttering out among the breakers?
What is that little black thing I see there in the white?
Loud! loud! loud!
Loud I call to you, my love!
Hiqh and clear I shoot my voice over the waves,
Surely you must know who is here, is here,
You must know who I am, my love.
Low-hanging moon!
What is that dusky spot in your brown yellow?
O it is the shape, the shape of my mate!
O moon do not keep her from me any longer.
Land! land! O land!
Whichever way I turn, O I think you could give me my mate back again if you only would,
For I am almost sure I see her dimly whichever way I look.
O rising stars!
Perhaps the one I want so much will rise, will rise with some of you.
O throat! O trembling throat!
Sound clearer through the atmosphere!
Pierce the woods, the earth,
Somewhere listening to catch you must be the one I want.
Shake out carols!
Solitary here, the niqht’s carols!
Carols of lonesome love! death’s carols!
Carols under that lagging, yellow, waning moon!
O under that moon where she droops almost down into the sea!
O reckless despairing carols.
But soft! sink low!
Soft! let me just murmur,
And do you wait a moment you husky-nois'd sea,
For somewhere I believe I heard my mate responding to me,
So faint, I must be still, be still to listen,
But not altogether still, for then she might not come immediately to me.
Hither my love!
Here I am! here!
With this just-sustain’d note I announce myself to you,
This gentle call is for you my love, for you.
Do not be decoy’d elsewhere,
That is the whistle of the wind, it is not my voice,
That is the fluttering, the fluttering of the spray,
Those are the shadows of leaves.
O darkness! O in vain!
O I am very sick and sorrowful.
O brown halo in the sky near the moon, drooping upon the sea!
O troubled reflection in the sea!        
O throat! O throbbing heart!
And I singing uselessly, uselessly all the night.         
O past! O happy life! O songs of joy!
In the air, in the woods, over fields,
Loved! loved! loved! loved! loved!
But my mate no more, no more with me!
We two together no more.
The aria sinking,
All else continuing, the stars shining,
The winds blowing, the notes of the bird continuous echoing,
With angry moans the fierce old mother incessantly moaning,
On the sands of Paumanok’s shore gray and rustling,
The yellow half-moon enlarged, sagging down, drooping, the face of the sea almost touching,
The boy ecstatic, with his bare feet the waves, with his hair the atmosphere dallying,
The love in the heart long pent, now loose, now at last tumultuously bursting,
The aria’s meaning, the ears, the soul, swiftly depositing,
The strange tears down the cheeks coursing,
The colloquy there, the trio, each uttering,
The undertone, the savage old mother incessantly crying,
To the boy’s soul’s questions sullenly timing, some drown’d secret hissing,
To the outsetting bard.
Demon or bird! (said the boy’s soul,)
Is it indeed toward your mate you sing? or is it really to me?
For I, that was a child, my tongue’s use sleeping, now I have heard you,
Now in a moment I know what I am for, I awake,
And already a thousand singers, a thousand songs, clearer, louder and more sorrowful than yours,
A thousand warbling echoes have started to life within me, never to die.
O you singer solitary, singing by yourself, projecting me,
O solitary me listening, never more shall I cease perpetuating you,
Never more shall I escape, never more the reverberations,
Never more the cries of unsatisfied love be absent from me,
Never again leave me to be the peaceful child I was before what there in the night,
By the sea under the yellow and sagging moon,
The messenger there arous’d, the fire, the sweet hell within,
The unknown want, the destiny of me.
O give me the clew! (it lurks in the night here somewhere,)
O if I am to have so much, let me have more!
A word then, (for I will conquer it,)
The word final, superior to all,
Subtle, sent up—what is it?—I listen;
Are you whispering it, and have been all the time, you sea-waves?
Is that it from your liquid rims and wet sands?
Whereto answering, the sea,
Delaying not, hurrying not,
Whisper’d me through the night, and very plainly before daybreak,
Lisp’d to me the low and delicious word death,
And again death, death, death, death,
Hissing melodious, neither like the bird nor like my arous’d child’s heart,
But edging near as privately for me rustling at my feet,
Creeping thence steadily up to my ears and laving me softly all over,
Death, death, death, death, death.
Which I do not forget,
But fuse the song of my dusky demon and brother,
That he sang to me in the moonlight on Paumanok’s gray beach,
With the thousand responsive songs at random,
My own songs awaked from that hour,
And with them the key, the word up from the waves,
The word of the sweetest song and all songs,
That strong and delicious word which, creeping to my feet,
(Or like some old crone rocking the cradle, swathed in sweet garments, bending aside,)
The sea whisper’d me."
I’m Nobody! Who are you? (260),"I’m Nobody! Who are you?
Are you – Nobody – too?
Then there’s a pair of us!
Don't tell! they'd advertise – you know!
How dreary – to be – Somebody!
How public – like a Frog –
To tell one’s name – the livelong June –
To an admiring Bog!"
Lift Every Voice and Sing,"Lift every voice and sing,
Till earth and heaven ring,
Ring with the harmonies of Liberty;
Let our rejoicing rise
High as the list'ning skies,
Let it resound loud as the rolling sea.
Sing a song full of the faith that the dark past has taught us,
Sing a song full of the hope that the present has brought us;
Facing the rising sun of our new day begun,
Let us march on till victory is won.
Stony the road we trod,
Bitter the chast'ning rod,
Felt in the days when hope unborn had died;
Yet with a steady beat,
Have not our weary feet
Come to the place for which our fathers sighed?
We have come over a way that with tears has been watered.
We have come, treading our path through the blood of the slaughtered,
Out from the gloomy past,
Till now we stand at last
Where the white gleam of our bright star is cast.
God of our weary years,
God of our silent tears,
Thou who hast brought us thus far on the way;
Thou who hast by Thy might,
Led us into the light,
Keep us forever in the path, we pray.
Lest our feet stray from the places, our God, where we met Thee,
Lest our hearts, drunk with the wine of the world, we forget Thee;
Shadowed beneath Thy hand,
May we forever stand,
True to our God,
True to our native land."
The Second Coming,"Turning and turning in the widening gyre
The falcon cannot hear the falconer;
Things fall apart; the centre cannot hold;
Mere anarchy is loosed upon the world,
The blood-dimmed tide is loosed, and everywhere
The ceremony of innocence is drowned;
The best lack all conviction, while the worst
Are full of passionate intensity.
Surely some revelation is at hand;
Surely the Second Coming is at hand.
The Second Coming! Hardly are those words out
When a vast image out of Spiritus Mundi
Troubles my sight: somewhere in sands of the desert
A shape with lion body and the head of a man,
A gaze blank and pitiless as the sun,
Is moving its slow thighs, while all about it
Reel shadows of the indignant desert birds.
The darkness drops again; but now I know
That twenty centuries of stony sleep
Were vexed to nightmare by a rocking cradle,
And what rough beast, its hour come round at last,
Slouches towards Bethlehem to be born?"
Stanzas,"Often rebuked, yet always back returning
    To those first feelings that were born with me,
And leaving busy chase of wealth and learning
    For idle dreams of things that cannot be:

To-day, I will seek not the shadowy region;
    Its unsustaining vastness waxes drear;
And visions rising, legion after legion,
    Bring the unreal world too strangely near.

I'll walk, but not in old heroic traces,
    And not in paths of high morality,
And not among the half-distinguished faces,
    The clouded forms of long-past history.

I'll walk where my own nature would be leading:
    It vexes me to choose another guide:
Where the gray flocks in ferny glens are feeding;
    Where the wild wind blows on the mountain side.

What have those lonely mountains worth revealing?
    More glory and more grief than I can tell:
The earth that wakes one human heart to feeling
    Can centre both the worlds of Heaven and Hell."
"Adonais, 49-52, [Go thou to Rome]","                  49

    Go thou to Rome,—at once the Paradise,
    The grave, the city, and the wilderness;
    And where its wrecks like shattered mountains rise,
    And flowering weeds, and fragrant copses dress
    The bones of Desolation's nakedness
    Pass, till the spirit of the spot shall lead
    Thy footsteps to a slope of green access
    Where, like an infant's smile, over the dead
A light of laughing flowers along the grass is spread;

                  50
      
    And gray walls moulder round, on which dull Time
    Feeds, like slow fire upon a hoary brand;
    And one keen pyramid with wedge sublime,
    Pavilioning the dust of him who planned
    This refuge for his memory, doth stand
    Like flame transformed to marble; and beneath,
    A field is spread, on which a newer band
    Have pitched in Heaven's smile their camp of death,
Welcoming him we lose with scarce extinguished breath.

                  51
      
    Here pause: these graves are all too young as yet
    To have outgrown the sorrow which consigned
    Its charge to each; and if the seal is set,
    Here, on one fountain of a mourning mind,
    Break it not thou! too surely shalt thou find
    Thine own well full, if thou returnest home,
    Of tears and gall. From the world's bitter wind
    Seek shelter in the shadow of the tomb.
What Adonais is, why fear we to become?

                  52
      
    The One remains, the many change and pass;
    Heaven's light forever shines, Earth's shadows fly;
    Life, like a dome of many-coloured glass,
    Stains the white radiance of Eternity,
    Until Death tramples it to fragments.—Die,
    If thou wouldst be with that which thou dost seek!
    Follow where all is fled!—Rome's azure sky,
    Flowers, ruins, statues, music, words, are weak
The glory they transfuse with fitting truth to speak."
"September 1, 1939","I sit in one of the dives
On Fifty-second Street
Uncertain and afraid
As the clever hopes expire
Of a low dishonest decade:
Waves of anger and fear
Circulate over the bright
And darkened lands of the earth,
Obsessing our private lives;
The unmentionable odour of death
Offends the September night.
Accurate scholarship can
Unearth the whole offence
From Luther until now
That has driven a culture mad,
Find what occurred at Linz,
What huge imago made
A psychopathic god:
I and the public know
What all schoolchildren learn,
Those to whom evil is done
Do evil in return.
Exiled Thucydides knew
All that a speech can say
About Democracy,
And what dictators do,
The elderly rubbish they talk
To an apathetic grave;
Analysed all in his book,
The enlightenment driven away,
The habit-forming pain,
Mismanagement and grief:
We must suffer them all again.
Into this neutral air
Where blind skyscrapers use
Their full height to proclaim
The strength of Collective Man,
Each language pours its vain
Competitive excuse:
But who can live for long
In an euphoric dream;
Out of the mirror they stare,
Imperialism's face
And the international wrong.
Faces along the bar
Cling to their average day:
The lights must never go out,
The music must always play,
All the conventions conspire
To make this fort assume
The furniture of home;
Lest we should see where we are,
Lost in a haunted wood,
Children afraid of the night
Who have never been happy or good.
The windiest militant trash
Important Persons shout
Is not so crude as our wish:
What mad Nijinsky wrote
About Diaghilev
Is true of the normal heart;
For the error bred in the bone
Of each woman and each man
Craves what it cannot have,
Not universal love
But to be loved alone.
From the conservative dark
Into the ethical life
The dense commuters come,
Repeating their morning vow;
""I will be true to the wife,
I'll concentrate more on my work,""
And helpless governors wake
To resume their compulsory game:
Who can release them now,
Who can reach the deaf,
Who can speak for the dumb?
All I have is a voice
To undo the folded lie,
The romantic lie in the brain
Of the sensual man-in-the-street
And the lie of Authority
Whose buildings grope the sky:
There is no such thing as the State
And no one exists alone;
Hunger allows no choice
To the citizen or the police;
We must love one another or die.
Defenceless under the night
Our world in stupor lies;
Yet, dotted everywhere,
Ironic points of light
Flash out wherever the Just
Exchange their messages:
May I, composed like them
Of Eros and of dust,
Beleaguered by the same
Negation and despair,
Show an affirming flame."
The Raven,"Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and weary,
Over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore—
While I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping,
As of some one gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door—
""'Tis some visitor,"" I muttered, ""tapping at my chamber door—
               Only this and nothing more.""
Ah, distinctly I remember it was in the bleak December;
And each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor.
Eagerly I wished the morrow;—vainly I had sought to borrow
From my books surcease of sorrow—sorrow for the lost Lenore—
For the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore—
               Nameless here for evermore.
And the silken, sad, uncertain rustling of each purple curtain
Thrilled me—filled me with fantastic terrors never felt before;
So that now, to still the beating of my heart, I stood repeating,
""'Tis some visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door—
Some late visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door;—
               This it is and nothing more.""
Presently my soul grew stronger; hesitating then no longer,
""Sir,"" said I, ""or Madam, truly your forgiveness I implore;
But the fact is I was napping, and so gently you came rapping,
And so faintly you came tapping, tapping at my chamber door,
That I scarce was sure I heard you""—here I opened wide the door;—
               Darkness there and nothing more.
Deep into that darkness peering, long I stood there wondering, fearing,
Doubting, dreaming dreams no mortal ever dared to dream before;
But the silence was unbroken, and the stillness gave no token,
And the only word there spoken was the whispered word, ""Lenore?""
This I whispered, and an echo murmured back the word, ""Lenore!""—
               Merely this and nothing more.
Back into the chamber turning, all my soul within me burning,
Soon again I heard a tapping somewhat louder than before.
""Surely,"" said I, ""surely that is something at my window lattice;
Let me see, then, what thereat is, and this mystery explore—
Let my heart be still a moment and this mystery explore;—
               'Tis the wind and nothing more!""
Open here I flung the shutter, when, with many a flirt and flutter,
In there stepped a stately Raven of the saintly days of yore;
Not the least obeisance made he; not a minute stopped or stayed he;
But, with mien of lord or lady, perched above my chamber door—
Perched upon a bust of Pallas just above my chamber door—
               Perched, and sat, and nothing more.
Then this ebony bird beguiling my sad fancy into smiling,
By the grave and stern decorum of the countenance it wore,
""Though thy crest be shorn and shaven, thou,"" I said, ""art sure no craven,
Ghastly grim and ancient Raven wandering from the Nightly shore—
Tell me what thy lordly name is on the Night's Plutonian shore!""
               Quoth the Raven ""Nevermore.""
Much I marvelled this ungainly fowl to hear discourse so plainly,
Though its answer little meaning—little relevancy bore;
For we cannot help agreeing that no living human being
Ever yet was blest with seeing bird above his chamber door—
Bird or beast upon the sculptured bust above his chamber door,
               With such name as ""Nevermore.""
But the Raven, sitting lonely on the placid bust, spoke only
That one word, as if his soul in that one word he did outpour.
Nothing further then he uttered—not a feather then he fluttered—
Till I scarcely more than muttered ""Other friends have flown before—
On the morrow he will leave me, as my hopes have flown before.""
               Then the bird said ""Nevermore.""
Startled at the stillness broken by reply so aptly spoken,
""Doubtless,"" said I, ""what it utters is its only stock and store
Caught from some unhappy master whom unmerciful Disaster
Followed fast and followed faster till his songs one burden bore—
Till the dirges of his Hope that melancholy burden bore
               Of 'Never—nevermore.'""
But the Raven still beguiling my sad fancy into smiling,
Straight I wheeled a cushioned seat in front of bird, and bust and door;
Then, upon the velvet sinking, I betook myself to linking
Fancy unto fancy, thinking what this ominous bird of yore—
What this grim, ungainly, ghastly, gaunt and ominous bird of yore
               Meant in croaking ""Nevermore.""
This I sat engaged in guessing, but no syllable expressing
To the fowl whose fiery eyes now burned into my bosom's core;
This and more I sat divining, with my head at ease reclining
On the cushion's velvet lining that the lamp-light gloated o'er,
But whose velvet violet lining with the lamp-light gloating o'er,
               She shall press, ah, nevermore!
Then, methought, the air grew denser, perfumed from an unseen censer
Swung by Seraphim whose foot-falls tinkled on the tufted floor.
""Wretch,"" I cried, ""thy God hath lent thee—by these angels he hath sent thee
Respite—respite and nepenthe, from thy memories of Lenore;
Quaff, oh quaff this kind nepenthe and forget this lost Lenore!""
               Quoth the Raven ""Nevermore.""
""Prophet!"" said I, ""thing of evil!—prophet still, if bird or devil!—
Whether Tempter sent, or whether tempest tossed thee here ashore,
Desolate yet all undaunted, on this desert land enchanted—
On this home by Horror haunted—tell me truly, I implore—
Is there—is there balm in Gilead?—tell me—tell me, I implore!""
               Quoth the Raven ""Nevermore.""
""Prophet!"" said I, ""thing of evil—prophet still, if bird or devil!
By that Heaven that bends above us—by that God we both adore—
Tell this soul with sorrow laden if, within the distant Aidenn,
It shall clasp a sainted maiden whom the angels name Lenore—
Clasp a rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore.""
               Quoth the Raven ""Nevermore.""
""Be that word our sign in parting, bird or fiend!"" I shrieked, upstarting—
""Get thee back into the tempest and the Night's Plutonian shore!
Leave no black plume as a token of that lie thy soul hath spoken!
Leave my loneliness unbroken!—quit the bust above my door!
Take thy beak from out my heart, and take thy form from off my door!""
               Quoth the Raven ""Nevermore.""
And the Raven, never flitting, still is sitting, still is sitting
On the pallid bust of Pallas just above my chamber door;
And his eyes have all the seeming of a demon's that is dreaming,
And the lamp-light o'er him streaming throws his shadow on the floor;
And my soul from out that shadow that lies floating on the floor
               Shall be lifted—nevermore!"
Landscape with the Fall of Icarus,"According to Brueghel
when Icarus fell
it was spring
a farmer was ploughing
his field
the whole pageantry
of the year was
awake tingling
near
the edge of the sea
concerned
with itself
sweating in the sun
that melted
the wings' wax
unsignificantly
off the coast
there was
a splash quite unnoticed
this was
Icarus drowning"
London,"I wander thro’ each charter’d street,
Near where the charter’d Thames does flow,
And mark in every face I meet
Marks of weakness, marks of woe.
In every cry of every man,
In every Infant’s cry of fear,
In every voice, in every ban,
The mind-forg’d manacles I hear.
How the Chimney-sweeper’s cry
Every blackning Church appalls;
And the hapless Soldier’s sigh
Runs in blood down Palace walls.
But most thro’ midnight streets I hear
How the youthful Harlot’s curse
Blasts the new-born Infant’s tear,
And blights with plagues the Marriage hearse."
Stone Anatomies,"We must be lost in stone
       in water
       into stone
       be quenched 
       in fire, dissolved and stoned
       in fire

We must be numbed
       in stone
       to wood, in wood’s
       stone jelly boned
       be whet
       in air, in air’s fierce
       drownings fired

Our beauties must be charred in wood
       through stone, through cutting water
       leafed

We must descend through stone’s
       soft foot, through sear and atom honed
       of nothing, out of nothing stained
       to stone

Our hands must sprout
       from starfish stone, from rain
       our fingers and from rain
       and stone’s dissolve of air
       our breathing
       and blood’s breathing
       beat to hair
From leaf and water seal
       to wood
       in bone, in bone’s
       red leafing
       fire
       the nostril into brain

The eye must beat
       in lizard light, in stone
       into the head’s webbed bone

That stone enough be loss to start the lung."
The Innocents,"To forego the prodigy of verse
That each speaking thing
Might utter itself only,
Its hapless uncompounded sense.
That each air’s wand
In the element of its happening
Unawaitedly cover
And draw unmournably off:
That naming was the terrible power
Gathering the last
Against its time,
The Midas miracle.
Till the entrusted ones,
The obliterators,
Absolved their sentence also—
The salt of itself singing."
"Day, Daylong","Day, daylong, how the soul goes staring 
At its shoes, expanse that widens nakedly 
To world
                 where each is poised
Assassin, suicide, to wrest
Redemption of the other in its choice: yours 
The helpless span narration cannot close.
Route nor spectacle will not go blind
Nor bind their broken conscience to a page: 
Learn to be No-one in the voice of none, 
Friend in that friendless element forever 
Unbegun, a sea, a body, a remorse—
Take up this leaf: what do the dead, 
The unborn defend? Your living syllable 
Too mute, too loyal to its desuetude 
To enter speech that does not speak 
Consent, and claim, and failure to conclude."
The Palace of Forty Pillars,"Isfahan is half the world
I
Twenty pillars drip into the pool
their likenesses, where the likeness of a boy
wavers among the clouds, eyeing the boy
who’s waiting for another. All is dual:
two rows of roses frame the pool, in twos
the swans glide, each on another’s breast, then fuse
in a headless embrace. All is dissolved:
the boy outside the water is no more
a boy inside the water—his no more
the face defaced by its own lines on shattered
waves overlapping like a rose, the tattered
pillars strewn like petals. All is halved,
severed, like home and school, like love and being
loved—the boy no more than a way of seeing."
Swan Song,"after the Persian of Mehdi Hamidi Shirazi
They say when the time comes for a swan to die,
it goes where other swans have gone to die.
They say as the last night begins to fall,
it trails behind the setting sun to die.
And it sings ghazals, as though it wished between
the pages of its own divan to die.
They say a swan loves only once and will
return to where its love was won to die.
Making its deathbed where it first made love,
it can forget it has withdrawn to die.
Are these tales true? In the desert, where I live,
no swan has come, not a single one, to die.
But then they say that swans return to water,
in whose embrace life was begun, to die.
Open your arms, my dear, and slake my thirst:
the time has come for one more swan to die."
The Yellow Swan,"I love the black swan.
—James Merrill, “The Black Swan”
At noon the pedaled swans afloat midstream
                 or parked at the water’s rim
find the boy first in line or there before
there is a line, and always the nice boatman
lets him mount his favorite ride, whose name 
                defies all rust and wear.
        He whispers, I love the yellow swan,
a secret he knows better than to share
                 save in the hollow ear-
like curve of that arched neck whose mirror image
breaks on rings of water as he climbs
between the wings and pedals from the pier, 
                a trail of molted plumage
         shuddering in his wake. The river foams,
churned by the paddle wheel and changed to ocean,
                 its surface cut by the question
mark of the swan—no, dragon!—gliding on
the hissing bloodstained waters as he turns
fire on darkness, almost wins his mission
                 while his parents chat in the sun,
         unaware of all that burns
down on the other bank. But like most love 
                the swan-ride is cut off.
The stroke of one o’clock returns the beast
to boat, the boat to boatman. He hates the boatman.
He hates his parents, whom he won’t forgive. 
                He hates the girl who’s next.
         Poor boy, he hates the yellow swan."
Coming Out of the Shower,"I shut my eyes under the scalding stream, 
                scrubbing off last night’s dream,
when suddenly I hear your voice again 
         as though it caught in the clogged drain
and was sent bubbling back up from the other 
                world where you’re not my mother.
This time, it’s really you. I’m really here. 
        I blink. We do not disappear.
Dad left, you say, to shower at the shop 
                so I don’t need to stop
just yet—and yet I do, unable to
         resume old customs, unlike you.
In a one-bath four-person household, we 
                learn what we mustn’t see,
growing, in time, so coolly intimate 
        with one another’s silhouette
behind the opaque frosted shower screen 
                that once more stands between
us two. While at the mirror you apply 
        foundation and concealer, I
wash out my hair with rosewater shampoo, 
                which means I’ll smell like you
all day. Mama, I shout, I’m coming out,
        and as you look away I knot
around me tight your lavender robe de chambre, 
                cinching my waist, and clamber
out of the tub, taking care not to step
         outside the cotton mat and drip
on the cracked floor you’ve polished with such zeal 
                we’re mirrored in each tile.
Yet, you’d forgive the spillage, or forget. 
        What else will you love me despite?"
Stare at the Sea,"Stare at the sea, the sea is blind.
The sea gives back your theme—
The sea that is not like, that cannot lack 
A thing
              —you have heard this sea intoned 
To every shock of chaos and of calm, 
As though soul’s torn two intellects 
Would marry in that hollow heave 
The harm they cannot fatalize, the thing 
A stonier dumb charm would weave 
Out of its own locked raging tides: 
The sea holds nothing it can hide.
Teach the sea to sing, the soul 
To drink its own imagining.
 "
Pilgrim Heights,"Something, something, the heart here 
Misses, something it knows it needs 
Unable to bless—the wind passes; 
A swifter shadow sweeps the reeds, 
The heart a colder contrast brushes.
So this fool, face-forward, belly 
Pressed among the rushes, plays out 
His pulse to the dune’s long slant 
Down from blue to bluer element, 
The bold encompassing drink of air
And namelessness, a length compound
Of want and oneness the shore’s mumbling 
Distantly tells—something a wing’s 
Dry pivot stresses, carved 
Through barrens of stillness and glare:
The naked close of light in light,
Light’s spare embrace of blade and tremor 
Stealing the generous eye’s plunder 
Like a breathing banished from the lung’s 
Fever, lost in parenthetic air.
Raiding these nude recesses, the hawk 
Resumes his yielding balance, his shadow 
Swims the field, the sands beyond, 
The narrow edges fed out to light, 
To the sea’s eternal licking monochrome.
The foolish hip, the elbow bruise
Upright from the dampening mat, 
The twisted grasses turn, unthatch, 
Light-headed blood renews its stammer—
Apart, below, the dazed eye catches
A darkened figure abruptly measured 
Where folding breakers lay their whites; 
The heart from its height starts downward, 
Swum in that perfect pleasure 
It knows it needs, unable to bless."

"This Time, Not an Intruder","Kids’ Club After-School Program, The Gray House, March 2015
Fear made me block the side door with the chain.
A woman, glassy-eyed, rang the bell as if on fire.
Say “stranger” and the kids’ heads pop up like lemmings,
the memory of an intruder in our program last year,
that snarling voice that is mine yet not mine—a live
current under their skin. Rushed to the front door,
kids are matched to names to faces to signatures
and the side bell rings again. This time, I open
that door wide to confront a woman dark-lit by the sun,
words tangling like brambles in her mouth.
Photographing the homeless? None here.
I wave her down the ramp, trash bags
in one hand, rush to lock up the house,
feel my energy ebb. Second trash run.
She’s still there, turning the air
above the steering wheel. Then slumps.
Tell me how an angel feels. Not this panic.
I run in and dial. A cop raps on the car window
she forgets how to open. 25—the blood sugar
level she shouldn’t have, if she wants to live.
 "
This Too Shall Pass,"was no consolation to the woman
whose husband was strung out on opioids.
Gone to a better place: useless and suspect intel
for the couple at their daughter’s funeral
though there are better places to be
than a freezing church in February, standing
before a casket with a princess motif. 
Some moments can’t be eased
and it’s no good offering clichés like stale
meat to a tiger with a taste for human suffering.
When I hear the word miracle I want to throw up
on a platter of deviled eggs. Everything happens
for a reason: more good tidings someone will try
to trepan your skull to insert. When fire
inhales your house, you don’t care what the haiku says
about seeing the rising moon. You want
an avalanche to bury you. You want to lie down
under a slab of snow, dumb as a jarred
sideshow embryo. What a circus.
The tents dismantled, the train moving on,
always moving, starting slow and gaining speed,
taking you where you never wanted to go."
You’re the Top,"Last night I get all the way to Ocean Street Extension, squinting through the windshield, wipers smearing the rain, lights of the oncoming cars half-blinding me. The baby’s in her seat in the back singing the first three words of You’re the Top. Not softly and sweetly the way she did when she woke in her crib, but belting it out like Ethel Merman. I don’t drive much at night anymore. And then the rain and the bad wipers. But I tell myself it’s too soon to give it up. Though the dark seems darker than I ever remember. And as I make the turn and head uphill, I can’t find the lines on the road. I start to panic. No! Yes—the lights! I flick them on and the world resolves. My god, I could have killed her. And I’ll think about that more later. But right now new galaxies are being birthed in my chest. There are no gods, but not everyone is cursed every moment. There are minutes, hours, sometimes even whole days when the earth is spinning 1.6 million miles around the sun and nothing tragic happens to you. I do not have to enter the land of everlasting sorrow. Every mistake I’ve made, every terrible decision—how I married the wrong man, hurt my child, didn’t go to Florence when she was dying—I take it all because the baby is commanding, “Sing, Nana.” And I sing, You’re the top. You’re the Coliseum, and the baby comes in right on cue."

living on marble street in the ’70s,"in a home with no books in spanish or english, papi’s tongue lashes the air

en español, they swallow their “esses,” leave syllables dangling pa’ ná’
    their rush to speak making words rise like mami’s incense 
        rising & slipping up through the kitchen fan
the rounded countertop radio out of my reach hurls spanish bolts of words
    too quick for me to catch and color with crayons I hide 
        from little brothers who stuff anything into their mouths
at five, i see & listen to sesame street, sound out slowly the muppets’ english
    with no “esses,” no broken words, letters slow enough
        for me to trace on the TV’s fat bubble screen

in preschool with no books in spanish, i learn my abc’s with no “esses,” no 
    broken words, no spanish rs for my first or last names
my american preschool teacher holds my right fist around crayon, shapes
    my first letters only in english, makes me mimic her voice 
        only in english, the only language that counts
            for me to survive"
The Alpine Sheep,"When on my ear your loss was knelled,
    And tender sympathy upburst, 
A little spring from memory welled,
    Which once had quenched my bitter thirst.
And I was fain to bear to you
    A portion of its mild relief, 
That it might be as healing dew,
    To steal some fever from your grief.
After our child’s untroubled breath
    Up to the Father took its way, 
And on our home the shade of Death
    Like a long twilight haunting lay,
And friends came round, with us to weep
    Her little spirit’s swift remove, 
The story of the Alpine sheep
    Was told to us by one we love.
They, in the valley’s sheltering care, 
    Soon crop the meadow’s tender prime,
And when the sod grows brown and bare, 
    The shepherd strives to make them climb
To airy shelves of pasture green, 
    That hang along the mountain’s side,
Where grass and flowers together lean, 
    And down through mist the sunbeams slide.
But naught can tempt the timid things 
    The steep and rugged paths to try,
Though sweet the shepherd calls and sings, 
    And seared below the pastures lie,
Till in his arms their lambs he takes,
    Along the dizzy verge to go; 
Then, heedless of the rifts and breaks,
    They follow on, o’er rock and snow.
And in those pastures, lifted fair, 
    More dewy-soft than lowland mead,
The shepherd drops his tender care, 
    And sheep and lambs together feed.
This parable, by Nature breathed, 
    Blew on me as the south-wind free
O’er frozen brooks, that flow unsheathed 
    From icy thraldom to the sea.
A blissful vision, through the night, 
    Would all my happy senses sway,
Of the good Shepherd on the height, 
    Or climbing up the starry way,
Holding our little lamb asleep,— 
    While, like the murmur of the sea,
Sounded that voice along the deep,
    Saying, “Arise and follow me!”"
"The Flag is Bleeding, 2019","after Faith Ringgold’s painting, The Flag is Bleeding (1997)
Twenty-one stars pin this mother’s grief
to royal blue, the sclera of her eyes, scarlet.
She can no longer see, no longer count.
Her hands press against her Sunday dress
her remaining son, her remaining daughter
—still wet from the bath—still safe
in their unknowing. They stand on tiptoe,
one on each of her broad brown feet, to keep
her from falling, from reading with her fingertips
the blooming glyphs of blood, names
of massacred in this country
she’s still afraid to call home. "
A Southern Night,"The sandy spits, the shore-lock’d lakes, 
   Melt into open, moonlit sea; 
The soft Mediterranean breaks 
            At my feet, free. 
Dotting the fields of corn and vine 
   Like ghosts, the huge, gnarl’d olives stand;
Behind, that lovely mountain-line! 
            While by the strand 
Cette, with its glistening houses white, 
   Curves with the curving beach away
To where the lighthouse beacons bright 
            Far in the bay.
Ah, such a night, so soft, so lone, 
   So moonlit, saw me once of yore 
Wander unquiet, and my own
            Vext heart deplore! 
The murmur of this Midland deep 
   Is heard to-night around thy grave 
There where Gibraltar’s cannon’d steep
            O’erfrowns the wave. 
In cities should we English lie, 
   Where cries are rising ever new, 
And men’s incessant stream goes by;
            We who pursue 
Our business with unslackening stride, 
   Traverse in troops, with care-fill’d breast, 
The soft Mediterranean side, 
            The Nile, the East, 
And see all sights from pole to pole, 
   And glance, and nod, and bustle by; 
And never once possess our soul 
            Before we die. 
Not by those hoary Indian hills, 
   Not by this gracious Midland sea
Whose floor to-night sweet moonshine fills, 
            Should our graves be! 
Some sage, to whom the world was dead,
   And men were specks, and life a play;
Who made the roots of trees his bed, 
            And once a day 
With staff and gourd his way did bend
   To villages and homes of man, 
For food to keep him till he end 
            His mortal span, 
And the pure goal of Being reach;
   Grey-headed, wrinkled, clad in white, 
Without companion, without speech, 
            By day and night 
Pondering God’s mysteries untold,
   And tranquil as the glacier snows––
He by those Indian mountains old 
            Might well repose!
Some grey crusading knight austere 
   Who bore Saint Louis company 
And came home hurt to death and here 
            Landed to die;
Some youthful troubadour whose tongue 
   Fill’d Europe once with his love-pain, 
Who here outwearied sunk, and sung
            His dying strain;
Some girl who here from castle-bower,
   With furtive step and cheek of flame,
’Twixt myrtle-hedges all in flower 
            By moonlight came 
To meet her pirate-lover’s ship, 
   And from the wave-kiss’d marble stair 
Beckon’d him on, with quivering lip 
            And unbound hair, 
And lived some moons in happy trance, 
   Then learnt his death, and pined away––
Such by these waters of romance
            ’Twas meet to lay! 
But you––a grave for knight or sage, 
   Romantic, solitary, still, 
O spent ones of a work-day age!
            Befits you ill. 
So sang I; but the midnight breeze 
   Down to the brimm’d moon-charmed main
Comes softly through the olive-trees,
            And checks my strain. 
I think of her, whose gentle tongue 
   All plaint in her own cause controll’d;
Of thee I think, my brother! young 
            In heart, high-soul’d;
That comely face, that cluster’d brow,
   That cordial hand, that bearing free, 
I see them still, I see them now, 
            Shall always see! 
And what but gentleness untired, 
   And what but noble feeling warm, 
Wherever shown, howe’er attired, 
            Is grace, is charm?
What else is all these waters are, 
   What else is steep’d in lucid sheen,
What else is bright, what else is fair, 
            What else serene?
Mild o’er her grave, ye mountains, shine! 
   Gently by his, ye waters, glide! 
To that in you which is divine
            They were allied."
Emesis,"From   her   perch   on  the  docent’s  gloved  wrist,  she
watches   us with the eyes  of any creature handled  too
much:  featherless head a closed door,  body a mask of
silence.   In   the  steep   twilight  descending  like   the
backwards  count of a  nurse’s  voice leading  a patient
into  unconsciousness,   the   handler  explains  to  our
circle   the  generalities    of   the   species—the    turkey
vulture’s    primary    form     of     self-defense   is     the
regurgitation   of   semi-digested    meat    that  is   then
vomited      onto     a       predator’s        face—and     the
particularities of this one, who had come   to them with
a broken wing.  I, too,  have places on my body  knitted
back together by unseen hands,  scars laid while I slept
the   sleep  of  the  unknowing:    one  above  the    belly
button,  and  another  below where   two  fingers   must
have parted the dark hair before shaving a path.   Does
she remember  the first faces to peer toward her  as she
surfaced?  Every time  I try to write  what those   hands
did,  I end   up  plunging  my own   fingers deep   inside
until  I  pull  up the voice  of the surgeon  in post-op:   I
usually have to pay women to take their clothes off for
me.  Oh, the shudder of her black-feathered shoulders.
Oh, the bile rising in her throat"
To the Dandelion,"    Dear common flower, that grow’st beside the way, 
Fringing the dusty road with harmless gold, 
          First pledge of blithesome May, 
Which children pluck, and full of pride, uphold,
   High-hearted buccaneers, o’erjoyed that they
      Eldorado in the grass have found, 
        Which not the rich earth’s ample round 
    May match in wealth, thou art more dear to me
   Than all the prouder summer-blooms may be. 
    Gold such as thine ne’er drew the Spanish prow
Through the primeval hush of Indian seas, 
          Nor wrinkled the lean brow 
Of age, to rob the lover’s heart of ease; 
   ’Tis the Spring’s largess, which she scatters now 
To rich and poor alike, with lavish hand, 
       Though most heart never understand 
    To take it at God’s value, but pass by 
    The offered wealth with unrewarded eye. 
    Thou art my tropics and mine Italy; 
To look at thee unlocks a warmer clime; 
          The eyes thou givest me 
Are in the heart, and heed not space or time:
    Not in mid June the golden-cuirassed bee
Feels a more summer-like warm ravishment 
       In the white lily’s breezy tent,
    His fragrant Sybaris, than I, when first 
    From the dark green thy yellow circles burst. 
    Then think I of deep shadows on the grass, 
Of meadows where in sun the cattle graze, 
          Where, as the breezes pass, 
The gleaming rushes lean a thousand ways, 
   Of leaves that slumber in a cloud mass, 
Or whiten in the wind, of waters blue 
      That from the distance sparkle through 
    Some woodland gap, and of a sky above, 
    Where one white cloud like a stray lamb doth move.
    My childhood’s earliest thoughts are linked with thee;
The sight of thee calls back the robin’s song,
          Who, from the dark old tree 
Beside the door, sang clearly all day long, 
     And I, secure in childish piety, 
Listened as if I heard an angel sing
        With news from heaven, which he could bring 
    Fresh every day to my untainted ears 
    When birds and flowers and I were happy peers. 
    How like a prodigal doth nature seem, 
When thou, for all thy gold, so common art! 
          Thou teachest me to deem
More sacredly of every human heart, 
    Since each reflects in joy its scanty gleam 
Of heaven, and could some wondrous secret show, 
       Did we but pay the love we owe, 
    And with a child’s undoubting wisdom look 
    On all these living pages of God’s book. "
Parable of the South Pole Buddha,"... the most tiny quantity of reality 
ever imagined by a human being

A physicist is stuck in a bunker at the South Pole, 
freezing his burrito off, and trying to detect the rare light
given off by one in six billion neutrinos streaking through 
the glacial ice, and it turns out he’s a guy I like 
talking poetry with sometimes and before he zooms 
to the white continent he tries to explain neutrinos to me 
like a priest describing the progress of the spirit to a child. 
  No, they’re not that three-piece punk band
from Philadelphia, making dancers oscillate in clubs
then fall into each other like so much dark matter.
Like most of us, they have a mean life and a half life.
Like most of us they decay too fast. But here’s the wonder:
these particles are so tiny, so unaffected, they shoot 
right through the planet and through us without so much 
as setting an electron quivering like a dragonfly’s wing. 
I wish I could do that, instead of lying in bed, 
feeling gravity glue me to the indentation in the mattress,
wish I could jet right through the world
like cosmic rain, a flight of neutrinos shaped like a poet 
and riding on the magic carpet of a weightless bed.
No tax forms, no lawyers, no dentists to drill 
through the crown to the rot and murder the root—
just stick my face in the pillow and jellyfish through.
I try to let go of my body, to drop without a parachute, 
a little Buddha, neither hot nor cold, but I can’t lift off 
like my friend who’s gone to glacial nowhere
and who sets up his machines while the unseen wind 
whishes by into the heart of cold, thinking 
he can measure the invisible, thinking he might actually 
understand what distinguishes us from nothing."
Lobster,"At Shaw’s Market the lobster tank sits
to the right of the fish counter, just left 
of the freezer with the fish sticks and frozen 
perch. Therein lie the lobsters, stacked like 
so many traps, brackish and silent, their pincers 
rendered useless, wrapped shut tight in yellow 
plastic. Scuttled into these briny and light-dulled 
shallows, they hulk like the wrecks of some 
forgotten sea floor. One evening, uneasy, 
I went home to read what I could: phylum, 
arthropoda – cousins to trilobites, crabs, insects, 
spiders. I studied the neurobiology, learned 
lobsters have hundreds of eyes but do not see, 
not exactly, and I thought of one I judged 
somnolent flinching his taped pincers at my 
reflection looming like an eclipse, my domestic-
ated glimpse into the deep, what terror
he must have felt coupled with an absence 
of sediment that must have felt like, well, 
nothing. Six hundred million years, I thought 
of him there, sedated, stunned by the salt light. 
The next day I returned intending to purchase 
several and set them free; failing, I drove by 
myself to the beach where I stared at the sea. 
Lobsters once ruled all I could see, their armored 
carapaces inviolable, feeding on anything that 
might be. Lords of the Cambrian prehistory, 
they crawled out of time and into the late 
Quaternary, which is to say, us, left to rule 
the world as we must. What thief waits for 
me, I can’t help but think, as I leave the store
with my groceries, feel my way through the lot
looking for my lost sedan, crawling with unease
through the summer dark and soft salt-breeze?"
Personal,"I am who I am
younger than you
might think though
older than I
thought possible
Like everybody
I like sunsets
hiking, baseball
and movies; also
were the Lord
in His wisdom
to bless me
with a sailboat
I am sure I would
enjoy sailing. I like
to see myself in my
mind lying on a
sailboat gazing
at the stars. I like
to see myself
as adventurous
a rebel and a dreamer
someone willing
to take chances
I am nice looking
and intelligent, honest
shy, caring, sensitive
and open-minded
Nothing to write home
about, though
you would not
be embarrassed
or ashamed
to take me home
to your mother
or your apartment
I am not opposed
to children, yours
or ours. I am
who I am
which is to say
because you are
reading this
you"

Blackbird,"(Miles Davis, 1926–1991)
This is what heroin must feel like—
Miles Davis exacting
his way through “Autumn Leaves”—
pretty and cold, a slowly spreading frost
along synapses and veins,
mapping interstellar darkness
one blue note at a time. Sometimes you could hear
him thinking through the changes
like he was hunting himself, relentless
and without mercy, then a burst of blue
flame, squeezing the Harmon mute like a man screaming
from the bottom of a mine shaft—
but however brightly the darkness glows,
it is still darkness, and Miles was a blackbird
on a field of snow, beautiful, distant, quiet—
and however many steps you take to meet him he flies
ten more feet away."
Epithalamium,"And it came to him that the question was loneliness-
when he grit his teeth, rearranging
his bones
                and self in an easy
chair, which would,
                                      as he thought, trigger
the worry he might dial her in the middle
of the night
                    only to hang up before she answers.
Then there were the variations: the loneliness
he wore with— no, like-
               a good sweater— while he sat in restaurants
reading magazines; while he explained
his life to people he met on airplanes; what made him
stand at the window thinking, without irony,
the private autumnal heart
is the last leaf to fall …
what resolved into a fugue
of silence, counterpoint
                                                 of all he would
never fully describe. As in the night he said
he loved her: billowing stars; black leaves;
berceuse wind. A sky
of stars, leaves, and wind. He remembered
thinking, with her in his arms,
of loneliness. What should he say? That they
would spend their evenings in metaphor,
in a house of silent song? That there
would be children?
Pray, love, that it be so simple."
ectopic,"In diagrams, there’s one on either side of 
            the uterus. But they float
                       
            around the coral pouch, tangle up, 
                        the surgeon said.
                       
Cilia sway like seagrass, 
            the tube wall pulsing with waves
                       
            of hairs to push the genetic scribble
                        through, out—
                       
Though not for me. I think of prior women knifed open
            to first acquire this knowledge.
           
            I think of vespers
                        mumbled over their noses and cheeks
                       
while the last few stars
            of thought punctuated the mind.
                       
            Blood smelled the same in the sixteenth 
                        century. Rain on flagstones, clay and spit.
                       
Gabriele Falloppio also studied the labyrinth 
            of the ear. Held the tiny drum
                       
            lightly in his palm. But the pink string 
                        I saw in my surgeon’s photograph
           
resembles a trumpet—the pipes
            pumped as though by a mouth.
                       
            Pucker, kiss.                 Tuba uteri.
                        We say tube. Flared opening releasing 
           
a breath of something. A legislated
            cell. There are raw edges to everything
                       
            if you look
                        closely. My stowaway was
                       
a silkworm caught in the grass, gathering

"After Bob Across the Street Fires His Gun at a Tree to Scare Off a Raccoon While My Son and I Walk, Rachel Shows Me Night Heron Chicks","That ants still emerge from a jasmine bloom

One Cup of Chai,"If I had known that the cup of chai 
my mother asked me, a drifter 
in the kitchen, to make her 
that afternoon, which I 
having blended water and milk 
in such strange ratios 
that when reduced and strained
the tea came up 
to barely one trisection of my pinkie
(that cup was the driest well I saw, 
the lowest tide) so to cover my blunder
I poured raw tap water to flood her cup 
and fled her room before she could 
collect her body, bring lip to saucer, 
had I known that the pale, putrid mess 
I presented, was after all, the only and 
last cup of tea I’d ever make her
would I have suddenly been 
granted the culinary wisdom to brew 
instead the pot with sprigs of lemongrass,
a pod of cardamom, perhaps even 
a prestigious thread of saffron
that I’d sneak from the silver hexagonal box 
she kept hidden behind the airtight jars 
of pricey nuts, and bring her
a creamy drink of complex caffeine, even
make some magnanimous promise 
of offering her tea on tap till she lived 
but knowing me, I know I’d have just 
continued being the spectacular failure I was 
that day, shit-talking my every inability 
out of her sight, embarrassed by failure, 
afraid of consequence and knowing her, 
she would have creased her nose 
at first, then continued to descend 
on the plate with the hopeful pull 
of her slurp, stubborn as she was, 
not willing to peg one finite judgement
of adulation or derision— 
on the cup she was served"
Abecedarian on the Good Father,"As he holds his wife’s hand, the nurse tells him to
breathe. He will be a good father. He 
could be. His wife tows a boat on land with her teeth. 
Don’t worry. Good father. Breathe. Later,
everyone smiles when he jogs with the stroller. He 
feigns interest in ponies. He pushes a swing and his daughter
giggles. He applies sunblock, and 
helps warm the bottle, and he is
inducted into the fatherly hall of fame. He 
jumps on the trampoline, and the chorus sings Good Father. He wipes
ketchup off her cheek at the zoo, and the old women 
laud. He is told he is a new breed of
man. Evolved. His knuckles just barely or
never scraping the ground. He hugs
often enough, packs her lunch, and the crowd 
pours on the applause. He lays her down for 
quiet time. It goes somewhat well. 
Rejoice, the people shout, for here is a
saint, as he lifts diapers to the conveyor belt.
Truthfully, he feels slightly
unwell. A bowl of plastic fruit is pretty, but 
vaguely toxic. He sleeps fine
without a mouth affixed to his chest. His bottle of
Xanax is half full. The nurse says,
You will be a good father. He jogs with the stroller. He reaches the
zenith of a very small hill. "
In Praise of Mystery: A Poem for Europa,"Arching under the night sky inky
with black expansiveness, we point
to the planets we know, we

pin quick wishes on stars. From earth,
we read the sky as if it is an unerring book
of the universe, expert and evident.

Still, there are mysteries below our sky:
the whale song, the songbird singing
its call in the bough of a wind-shaken tree.

We are creatures of constant awe,
curious at beauty, at leaf and blossom,
at grief and pleasure, sun and shadow.

And it is not darkness that unites us,
not the cold distance of space, but
the offering of water, each drop of rain,

each rivulet, each pulse, each vein.
O second moon, we, too, are made
of water, of vast and beckoning seas.

We, too, are made of wonders, of great
and ordinary loves, of small invisible worlds,
of a need to call out through the dark."
Postcolonial,"for Louis Chude-Sokei
I went to graduate school because I was lonely
only to find myself
more lonely—lost scaling the canyons and breaches
of who I was and what I loved: books
women, ideology:
stuck in the brambles of politics and melanin.
Walking the stacks and quadrangles, at war
with my subject
positions, unable to locate my position
on any map;
I have become my invention. I have my theories.
The self is a theory, a way of walking, a history
and a geography, four and five dimensions, several
kinds of time: uncharted
terrain, and, look, there I am, lost on the shores
of my longing—
walking the campus of my limits, lost
and contemplating
the war I fought with sentiment, the war I lost
with solitude."
From “An Epistle”,"From Joshua Ibn Vives of Allorqui to his former master, Solomon Levi-Paul, de Santa-Maria, Bishop of Cartagena, Chancellor of Castile, and privy councillor to King Henry III of Spain.
                                       I.
Master and Sage, greetings and health to thee, 
    From thy most meek disciple! Deign once more 
Endure me at thy feet, enlighten me, 
    As when upon my boyish head of yore, 
Midst the rapt circle gathered round thy knee 
    Thy sacred vials of learning thou didst pour.
By the lage lustre of thy wisdom orbed 
Be my black doubts illumined and absorbed. 
                                       II.
Oft I recall that golden time when thou, 
    Born for no second station, heldst with us 
The Rabbi’s chair, who are priest and bishop now;
    And we, the youth of Israel, curious, 
Hung on thy counsels, lifted reverent brow 
    Unto thy sanctity, would fain discuss 
With thee our Talmud problems good and evil, 
Till startled by the risen stars o’er Seville. 
                                       III.
For on the Synagogue’s high-pillard porch
    Thou didst hold session, till the sudden sun 
Beyond day’s purple limit dropped his torch. 
    Then we, as dreamers, woke, to find outrun 
Time’s rapid sands. The flame that may not scorch,
    Our hearts caught from thine eyes, thou Shining One. 
I scent not yet sweet lemon-groves in flower, 
But I re-breathe the peace of that deep hour. 
                                       IV.
We kissed the sacred borders of thy gown, 
    Brow-aureoled with thy blessing, we went forth
Through the hushed byways of the twilight town. 
    Then in all life but one thing seemed of worth, 
To seek, find, love the Truth. She set her crown 
    Upon thy head, our Master, at thy birth;
She bade thy lips drop honey, fired thine eyes 
With the unclouded glow of sun-steeped skies. 
                                       V. 
Forgive me, if I dwell on that which, viewed 
    From thy new vantage-ground, must seem a mist 
Of error, by auroral youth endued 
    With alien lustre. Still in me subsist 
Those reeking vapors; faith and gratitude 
    Still lead me to the hand my boy-lips kissed 
For benison and guidance. Not in wrath,
Master, but in wise patience, point my path. 
                                       VI.
For I, thy servant, gather in one sheaf
    The venomed shafts of slander, which thy word 
Shall shrivel to small dust. If haply grief, 
    Or momentary pain, I deal, my Lord
Blame not thy servant’s zeal, nor be thou deaf 
    Unto my soul’s blind cry for light. Accord—
Pitying my love, if too superb to care 
For hate-soiled name—an answer to my prayer."
Blessing the Baby,"When my upstairs neighbor invites me to her baby shower, 
                I feel guilty about forgetting to bring in my recycling bins, 
again. I am a bad neighbor, but she’s going to be a mother 
                so she’ll have to practice forgiveness on someone first. Usually, 
I’m a people pleaser. I am a people. I was born 
                with all the people I could ever create, inside me. I try 
to forgive them—their dirty handprints on my skirt, the towels
                left on the bathroom floor. We blessed the baby 
while we tied around our wrists one long, red string. 
                For a moment, the string connected us—wives, mothers, 
and me, neither—until it didn’t, until the scissors severed 
                us, made a bracelet of the blood string. I told the baby, 
I give you this wrist. The world will break all your blessings
                if it wants, and believe me, baby, most of the time, it wants."
Sonnet,"I would not tarry if I could be gone 
    Adown the path where calls my eager mind. 
    That fate which knows naught but to grip and bind 
Holds me within its grasp, a helpless pawn, 
And checks my steps when I would travel on. 
    Forever shall my body lag behind, 
    And in this valley with the moaning wind 
Must I abide with never a glimpse of dawn? 
Though bends my body towards the yawning sod, 
    I can endure the pain, the sorrows rife, 
That hold me fast beneath their chastening rod, 
    If from this turmoil and this endless strife, 
Comes there a light to lead man nearer God, 
    And guide his footsteps toward the Larger Life."
“Thhhat was great”,"My Stutter Speaks, Pt. 6
So much order you’ve imposed: perfectly-folded middle-school textbook covers, travel ensembles planned and packed by day, scheduled playtime for your children. You try so hard to counter my dependable, haphazard presence in our partnership. Even your first sex was by appointment—your mother’s weekly Wednesday commute to Jersey opened the afternoon to the slow climb of foreplay, a late April day’s long light, Al B. Sure, and candles as ambiance. I knew I meant too much to you to leave with your virginity, but in the days before, reading Jackie Collins on the subway to and from school, anticipation growing like a gorged, cocooned caterpillar, you thought orgasm while engaged in the act might sublimate me with your first petite mort, might flip the script, fill my silences with your words, thoughts spilling winged like a butterfly. But alongside your genetic need for just-so, I grew in you, with you, for you, knew before you tried to break the silence with (fluent?) pillow talk that I would be your most loyal lover."
"Walking Beside the Cemetery, Olivia Street, Key West","The City Cemetery was established in 1847 
on “high ground, sixteen feet above sea level” in Key West 
following the disastrous hurricane of October 11, 1846, 
where the then beachside cemetery was unearthed due 
to the winds and seas.
                                   —“Historic Key West City Cemetery,” City of Key West Florida

In Key West, the living surround the dead, 
who are the best neighbors 
silent and agreeable as well-swept porches. 
A fence that separates this world 
from the next keeps their restless spirits 
in or ours out. Do these dead know they are 
dead, lying in their own dead ghetto, their little 
houses stacked, neat bleachers, or lined up like 
rows of beach towels? 
Each morning the living rise like drowned 
voyagers from their beds, dreams, sleep slough 
falling from their eyes. They greet mortality 
a footfall from their door. What is it like to live 
among the dead? What is it like to rest among 
the living? Do the dead dream too? 
Do they turn their dead faces beyond the fence, 
like moths to fever and regret?
Once, the sea rose like an emancipator 
and pulled the dead from their parched 
slumber. Bones as needy as dry fruit rose 
like giddy children upon the sea’s fickle back. 
What joy that must have been, to ride 
the sea free of stone abode, to leap 
and turn like froth, like ash dancing 
among a living flame. In the end 
the dead were dead again, slumped in trees 
and elsewhere like drowned creatures, and the 
living were left alive again to bury and to mourn."
Incognito Grief: A Blues,"Who knows the secrets in my gaze?
What holds me back when I might choke?
Who sees beyond my taut hellos
To see the grief etched on my face?
Nobody knows what lurks within;
Nobody brings me back again.
Who needs to disappear for a while?
Who sings my name beyond the veil?
Who has my memories, my tales?
Who’s lurking in my carpet’s dust?
Nobody feels this weight beneath my skin.
Who knows I’m grieving as I walk?
Who has the list of gravity’s costs?
Nobody but the man I’ve lost."
Migraines have their say,"Whitney cottage, Hermitage Artist Retreat
You could write about the windows
all nine of them. You could write about 
the gulf, red tide strangling Florida’s 
shore, the opaque eyes of dead fish
caught in the algal bloom. You could write 
about the sky—long as a yawn, sky blue
chasing cerulean away, stretched wisps
of white determined to be the canvas 
for another sunset showstopper. But the body
has its own narrative in mind. Neurons hustling 
pain blank out any page. No writing can be done 
when an electric snare corrals the brain. No ear 
searching for song while one temple pulses 
an arrhythmic lament. Mercifully there’s triptan, 
a black curtain over this inflammatory act. Strike
through today, uncap the pen again tomorrow."
Woman with Mop and Bucket,"She’s smocked in blue, like peasants by Millet
at work, a crook or pail in hand, or bent,
perhaps, for sewing, nursing, sheaving hay,
their faces worn by pity and consent.
The airport crowds have atomized by now;
the loos are nearly empty. There, alone,
she traces arcs, a model showing how
it’s done—left, right, ahead—as if to hone
her gestures as a dance routine. She sings,
a thread that rises, falls, and floats.
The words are muffled. Might her voice give wings
to home thoughts, in its melancholy notes?
I speak to her in English; no reply,
no recognition. I use Spanish then;
she’s pensive, unaware. So should I try
my Creole French? But no; to speak again
would seem interrogation. Does she see
me, even, leaning as she swirls her mop?
She is the body of the melody,
its mute existence when the song must stop."
Sand Paintings,"The grains propose the spectrum of the landscape (golden,
ochre, glassy, iron red, black of basalt), sorted, sifted.
In his furrowed palms the artist holds the sunlight’s
glint, admires coolness poured from earthen jars. With
a willow stick, he sketches on the ground until idea takes
shape. A hawk on steady currents circles, dips, and dives;
at play, a boy picks up a pinecone, turns it in his hand,
and casts it lightly, carrying his thought, among the trees.
The underlayer of the painting shaped, compressed,
the man then drips the crystal granules in geometries
of mind’s design, for mind’s enchantment and the eye’s,
yet born in nature: mountains, rivers, mesas, birds,
the sun and stars, changed into lines and circles, triangles,
the z’s of storm—commending by world’s matter
God’s primordial words. The artist pauses, straightens
edges, steps away, seeing his handiwork in its gratuity—
an offering to others, to the day’s divinities: what could be
more sacramental than to borrow the earth, reshape
and order it, returning it to earth as a diurnal sacrifice?
The work, perfected, moves toward its undoing as the sun
above the distant mesa waits immobile, swelling like
a woman’s body and inflamed, then plunges down,
leaving a ruddy afterbirth. In shadow now, the picture
is erased by him who made it, who himself is dust—bound
to heaven’s motions, honoring God’s time by dying in it."
"René Char Leaves France, 1944","—Southern France
The captive springtime moves on espadrilles
among mimosas flaming into bloom,
their coral lamps illumined through the hills,
investing the Vaucluse with their perfume.

With others, René Char awaits the news
from England, knowing that the final fight
is coming. Orders meanwhile. To refuse
all compromise has been his word. Tonight

he’s flying out for Africa, above
the olive groves and lemon-scented earth
to which his acts are rooted, as in love
inscribing him, beyond the fact of birth,
by poetry and sacrifice for France.
He leaves in secrecy: no fanfares yet;
but down the darkened slopes of the Durance,
where stealthily the shadows cast their net,

his men have lighted fires in farewell,
whose constellations shine along his route
as brilliant sea-marks in the mistral’s swell—
each star fraternal and a last salute."
Mas El Solanot,"When you invited me to Mas El Solanot,
with its hydrangeas, hibiscus, vines,
you did not say that in the afternoon,
as light collected, pensive, in a haze
beyond the apple trees and fields of hay,
my eyes could go from fold to fold, along
the blue conceptions of the Pyrenees
until they turn to clouds, nor how the cliffs
of Castelfollit de la Roca hold
the houses on their shoulders, balancing
ideas of artefact and world—and how
the arches of the bridge at Besalú
dissolve against the evening sun, then form
again from shadows on the other side,
in Romanesque relief. And later, when
we had commended the paella, praised
your Catalan rosé, the darkness brought
the music of Albéniz, gathering
the high chromatic landscapes into sound;
And on an old Chilean disk we heard
Neruda in inimitable voice
declaim the soul of Machu Picchu, name
its stones, its hunger and its misery—
the glorious, enduring suffering
of man. I leaned over the window, felt
a stillness in the wind, the stirring rock,
as if the earth acknowledged our design.
You wove me in, a figure in your scene,
a word among your words. The evidence
is places in the mind—the painted mas
surprising me, the harmonies of line,
the mountains soughing in their leafy dream."
The Bookseller,"Until I die, I shall abide by books—
feeling the leather and the gilded spine,
running my thumb along the rippled edge,
sensing the musty cloth, the wormy page,
the odor of a chest or rooms untended
where some distant heir one day divined
a windfall for his bank account, and called
on me. Here, watch your step; I cannot
see, but my companion says that books
have almost filled the hallway, overflowed
the bedroom, where I feel their presence
in the night among my dreams,—Will you have
a cup of tea and scones, or else a hot cross
bun, to mark the season? Yes, all London
bustles here near Oxford Street, and I suppose
I need the sense that others are about;
but what we know most keenly is desire,
and in desire I know the darkness, not
the life I hear but that which I Imagine—
the way you, reading of the Trojan War
or the Crusades, perhaps, are startled
by the telephone, thinking of Helen’s face
instead, of Hector’s body pulled behind
the wheels of arrogance. Tamer of horses
I can never be—but rider of another world
informed by paper—and, for me, in tongues
beneath my fingertips. To sell, of course,
is necessary, and I thank you; but I need
to feel behind me, too, this field of words
aflame, where blinded poets make the Sirens
sing, and I can almost glimpse the light,
the dazzling seascape that Odysseus sailed."
Dissidence,"in memoriam Thelonious Monk
You have to be able to hear past the pain, the obvious
minor-thirds and major-sevenths, the merely beautiful
ninths; you have to grow deaf to what you imagine
are the sounds of loneliness; you have to learn indifference
to static, and welcome noise like rain, acclimate
to another kind of silence; you have to be able to sleep
in the city, taxis and trucks careening through your dreams
and back again, hearing the whines and sirens and shrieks
as music; you must be a mathematician, a magician
of algebra, overtone and acoustics, mapping the splintered
intervals of time, tempo, harmony, stalking or sluicing blues
scales; you have to be unafraid of redundance, and aware
that dissonance-driven explorations of dissonance
may circle back to the crowded room of resolution;
you have to disagree with everything except the piano, black
and white keys marking the path you must climb step
by half-step with no compass but the blues, no company
but your distrust of the journey, of all that you hear, of arrival."

Pennywhistle,"(Seamus Heaney, 1938–2013)
Let the low
notes drone
like experience, steady
as they weather rock
and human faces, bring
the waves, shape
the sands, bend
and ripple the grass
up strands and estuaries—
the midrange stands
for the imagination
a steady melody and dance
of comfort
and the gentling
tasks of the everyday
the moments when
a maker might glance
at loved ones
and catch a breath—
that leaves the keening

a register of cries
that cannot be controlled
or hidden, the sail
that becomes
the sky, the wind
and too high
for even the keener
to hear"

Gwendolyn Brooks,"Sometimes I see in my mind’s eye a four or five
year old boy, coatless and wandering
a windblown and vacant lot or street in Chicago
on the windblown South Side. He disappears
but stays with me, staring and pronouncing
me guilty of an indifference more callous
than neglect, condescension as self-pity.
Then I see him again, at ten or fifteen, on the corner,
say, 47th and Martin Luther King, or in a group
of men surrounding a burning barrel off Lawndale,
everything surrounding vacant or for sale.
Sometimes I trace him on the train to Joliet
or Menard, such towns quickly becoming native
ground to these boys who seem to be nobody’s
sons, these boys who are so hard to love, so hard
to see, except as case studies.
Poverty, pain, shame, one and a half million

Santa Tarantula,"Now we praise her, her soft scopulae
for scaling glass, her silk spinnerets, always
reaching. There is shifting the egg sac often,
which a male arachnologist named brooding.
There is losing babies and calling this
our lives. There is singingsingingsinging, staring
into another mother’s face and saying it is still
the sun. Also, bittersweet sea smoke. Also,
burnt sugar hissing on the stove. There is scaphism:
death by milk and honey in a shallow dish.
There is shame surfacing like foam.
There is the most powerful species named johnnycashi,
and his hooks there to restrain our fangs during sex.
“If one crawls into my bed and I name it, will it be
nicer to me?” asks one man, as some of us cling
to trees, some to the soil sacristy. Praise
the tarantula woman still alive at forty. Praise her shifting
smalt of sky, her quiet stare, her morning face shriving
the sheets. This is how you kill a tarantula.
Cover her, and hope to God she suffocates."
I Consider Violence,"When the starvation-hair appears
all over my body, you call it fascinating,
which is not the same as beautiful.
I never decide what to wish for first,
food or you. Or rather, eating food again
or never again eating you. Your favorite part
of me, my cupped hipbone, empty
as a half mango scooped clean of its flesh.
Your least favorite part, my hunger.
I learn to fill myself with other things:
the julienned light in the bedroom, mouthfuls
of Debussy from the old piano, the endless suck
of the toilet, which, bravely, never stops running.
Even vowels become impossible luxuries,
so round they seem indulgent against my tongue.
I consider violence after hearing that on death row
you get one last perfect meal. I imagine the photo
in the newspaper story, where I look so
beautiful.
I think of the woman in the Bible
who asks for John’s head on a platter.
Maybe she was only hungry.
Maybe she wanted to be satisfied."
Knockout Rose,"There is nothing but this
moment of purple October
with its fertile dusks.
The thrips have paused
to watch the oaks wetten.
The larkspurs have come
into their roundness. Can you
feel the pines flirt with the light?
Would you brush a little onto my face?
I arch against your palm
until you cannot look away.
Somehow, this has become
our normal. A young girl
might do anything
for a hint of light on her face."
The Black Man’s Bit,"O there’s talk from school to pulpit, and the barber’s place is rife,
And the shoe shop and the supper table hum,
With the tale of Dixie’s black men who have shared the mighty strife
For that freedom of the better time to come.
Every mother’s eye is brighter, every father’s back is straighter,
And our girls are tripping lightly in their pride,
And by none except a Teuton, or a slacker, or a traitor, 
Will the right to their elation be denied.
They said they were too slow, too dull, too this and that to do it,
They couldn’t match the method of the Hun,
And then to arm a million—why, the land would surely rue it
If a million blacks were taught to use a gun.
But right won out, and they went in at all detractors smiling;
They learned as quick as any how to shoot,
They took the prize at loading ships, and riveting and piling,
And trained a thousand officers to boot.
And when they went ’twas with a boon no others had been bringing,
For whether with a pick or with a gun,
They lightened every labor with a wondrous sort of singing,
And turned the pall of battle into fun.
O the Frenchman was a marvel, and the Yankee was a wonder,
And the British line was like a granite wall,
But for singing as they leaped away to draw the Kaiser’s thunder,
The swarthy sons of Dixie beat them all.
And now that they have helped to break the rattling Hunnish sabre,
They’ll trail the Suwanee River back again
To Dixie home, and native song, and school and honest labor,
To be as men among their fellow men.
No special thanks or praise they'll ask, no clapping on the shoulder
They did their bit, and won, and all men know it
And Dixie will be proud of them, and grown a little older,
And wiser, too, will welcome them and show it."
Wild Beauty,"Such a wild beauty 
extracted from black ashes (echo) 
A series of calculated crashes 
I simply
call them romances.  
I photograph you in my bed in the morning 
I miss you and you never leave 
Your scent remains, unbelievably 
I pray to all the Gods 
and my lies still don’t believe in me. 
You dance inside the snow 
Slush beneath your boots 
We talk philosophy and hardcover books 
Sometimes i find the heart you took and carry 
It around, a handsome crook 
A savior among a crown 
of thorns and petals never worn 
Of flowers dead and letters never sent 
Did you see the way the summer wept 
Did you feel my bones break 
                                   inside your hands
? 
How fragile are the strong and mad
Who dare to wrap themselves in flags
Sewn by slaves and walked over graves (echo)
Jessica, you say, you must behave. 
Yourself. I don’t know what to do with wealth 
Cept spend it on a love affair or place bright flowers 
In my hair. 
Just tell me what color I should wear to a funeral
                                with no people there? 
Bodies asleep deep in my chest 
Kiss me, since we are all that’s left 
In love, in fear, scared half to death 
Humans aren’t so interesting my son insists 
We have no wings. No power beyond our century 
We are given less, and still we sing. 
We dress the part 
I keep the veil, and pawn the rings. 
I want to steal Saul’s new hat and Dante’s bright green boots 
My fashionable brothers. 
You. Brooklyn bridge. I am hula     hoop 
Swirling dervish in a perfect suit 
Oh my love, my memory swoons. 
Such a wild beauty extracted from black ashes (echo) 
A series of calculated crashes 
I simply call them     beautiful massive 
Oh wait, I believe I wrote romances. 
Protecting me from the brutality, the wounded savage 
You, that’s me. Pointing fingers deliciously. 
Baby, please hold onto me. 
I only want love to hold me for ransom. I know he is. 
They are all so handsome. Perhaps, a very good looking cancer. 
I call your name, pray you don’t answer. 
Such a wild 
           beauty."

Gills,"We must have gills
hidden under keloid skin,
because sometimes we are too
tired from forging rivers, navigating
tides, and crossing gulfs.
I convince myself I can breathe underwater. 
How else have we emerged from 
Gulf loop currents and New Sargasso seas?

But these songs dredge-up memories like water
pouring from spaces between soil and root, flood dry plains 
lifting to carry me through the hurricane.
Speaking in polyvocal tongues center of eye calm 
makes way for calamity. We know how to swim 
holding our breath across generations.
You see, we do have gills…

It’s how we float."
Everybody’s Autobiography,"I find myself most alone 
When I believe I am striving for glory. 
These times, cool and sharp,  
A monument of moon-white stone 
lodges in place near my heart. 
In a dream, my children  
Glisten inside raindrops, or teardrops. 
Like strangers, like seeds of children.  
I will only be allowed to claim them 
if I consent to love everyone’s children. 
If I consent to love everyone’s children, 
Only then will I be allowed to claim them, 
My strangers, my seeds of children, 
Glistening inside raindrops or teardrops 
In my dream. Children 
Lodged in place near my heart— 
A monument of moon-white stone, 
Cool and sharp. 
I believe I am striving for glory 
When I find myself most alone. "
Seven Steps to Heaven Haiku,"If every bomb 
Appeared in the sky a dove
Shrapnel into rain
If vengeance vanquished 
From the cursed lips of weak men
An idea never taking root
If every tank vanished
If by chance a miracle
Peace reclaims the land
If laughter broke out
Like wars fought with satire’s
Pugilist punning 
What room would there be
For anger what bitter root
Not allowed to stretch
Its tentacles 
Through the hearts of men hardened
By indifference 
What will we bequeath 
Our children if not a world
Evermore human"
The Octoroon,"One drop of midnight in the dawn of life’s pulsating stream
Marks her an alien from her kind, a shade amid its gleam.
Forevermore her step she bends, insular, strange, apart—
And none can read the riddle of her strangely warring heart.
The stormy current of her blood beats like a mighty sea
Against the man-wrought iron bars of her captivity.
For refuge, succor, peace, and rest, she seeks that humble fold
Whose every breath is kindliness, whose hearts are purest gold."
Douglas,"      Is Douglas dead? 
That grand old man, that pleasant face,
      That mirrored idol of the Negro Race!
Has he been struck from foremost rank, 
       Into earth’s dusty apron sank
And no one to take his place? 
               God forbid!
Yea forbid that the winds should mourn,
      Or on zephyr’s timely wings be borne
That word: For death in silent tread,
      Would loath to disgrace that honored head
By writing ’bove it “He is dead:”
                 For he lives. 
And every hour that wings away,
    Prolongs his life another day.
For sure the flower from its stalk, 
     May drop and wither upon the walk, 
Yet lives to bloom again that stalk: 
               So Douglas lives.
He tho’ a plant of the tropics, grew
     In America to live and do;
And did he it, and did it well,
      True until his gray hairs fell.
Of a greater man, no records tell,
      And still he lives. 
Tho’ kind old mother earth, perhap, 
   Doth rock him gently in her lap, 
His slumber is sweetest rest:
   Gray hairs float on his mother’s breast: 
Yet speak not of him, but as the best, 
    For still he lives. 
And up this barrier wall of life, 
    His deed amid the storm and strife, 
Doth, clutching, climb on like the vine, 
    Around each rock some tendrils twine, 
Till blossom they in warm sunshine
                    To never die. 
No, never, tho’ that aged head
    Be lulled to sleep—but one was made, 
And making him, was made a cleft
     In earth, and not a remnant left, 
From which another might be made. 
     So sleep on thou aged blest, 
Thy work is done, so take thy rest. 
     For bear, O winds, to murmur aught
But praise for mighty deeds he wrought! 
     Rock gently in thy orb, O earth,
Frey not him of humble birth, 
     But let him rest. 
Stoop down, O heaven, kiss his brow, 
    For oft before thee did he bow; 
Let holy angels watch his grave, 
    And ne’er let man forget the brave,
The good, the noble, humble slave 
   Who rose to highest fame."
Her Last Farewell,"O welcome death! I’m glad you’ve come
       ’Twill serve my purpose true:
Just cut eternity’s veil in twain
        And let my soul pass through, 
And away from Earth’s dismal scene
        And the merry making crowd, 
The giddy whirl of the banquet hall,
        To home beyond the cloud—
Ah! then, dear mother, weep no more, 
       But strive to meet me there: 
The space is small twixt life and death, 
      Fill it well with prayer—
So now, O, death, let fall thy sword, 
      ’Tis but a kiss of love
Much welcomed by the eager soul, 
    Waiting to flit above. 
Farewell to earth! Farewell to friends. 
     To maiden young and gay, 
Think well on how you spend your life, 
    For death will come one day. "
Sonnet,"God is and is seen wherever we look, 
From the roaring sea to the noiseless brook;
From the everlasting snow-clad hill,
To the smallest sand beneath the rill.
The granite rock and the liquid flood,
Each portray the living hand of God!
From the blazing sun that rules the day,
To the faint light of the glow worm’s ray;
From the blue vaults of the azure sky,
From all the nocturnal worlds on high;
To the smallest insects on the ground,
Wherever that insect may be found,
The daguerreotype of God is there,
Insects, stars and sky and sun declare. "
I’ll Follow Thee,"My Savior, let me hear Thy voice tonight, 
    I’ll follow Thee, I’ll follow Thee; 
The clouds that overhang my way, obscure
  the light, 
    And all is dark to me. 
I’d hear Thy voice above the tempest’s shriek; 
    I’ll follow Thee, I’ll follow Thee; 
And though my sight be dim, my spirit weak, 
    I’ll trust, though naught I see. 
I’d feel Thy arm, supporting in the dark; 
    I’ll follow Thee, I’ll follow Thee; 
For Thou canst fan to flame, faith’s sinking 
  spark, 
    And seal my loyalty.
I shall not sink, dear Lord, when Thou’rt my 
    guide, 
       I’ll follow Thee; I’ll follow Thee; 
Though lashed by heavy waves, on ev’ry side, 
       I’m safe, when Thou’rt with me."
Oh List to My Song!,"Oh list to my song, my sweet, dark eyed 
 dove! 
   Oh list to thy lover today! 
For I’ve come from afar, to woo thee
 again, 
   Though, erstwhile, you sent me away. 
But I heard thy sighs in my troubled 
 dreams. 
   And methought they were sighs of pain; 
So I’ve come, I’ve come on the wings of 
 of my love, 
   To offer my true heart again. 
Oh say that my heart has not hoped in 
 vain! 
   Oh tell me the sweet dream was true! 
And lift those dark lashes, oh sweet love 
 of mine,
   And hide not thine eyes from my view.
Oh love, those dear eyes are telling the 
 tale, 
   That thy lips refuse to repeat! 
Come thou, to my heart; thou art mine, 
 thou art mine, 
   Till time and eternity meet!"
"Not Dead, but Sleeping","We say he is dead; ah, the word is too 
   somber; 
’Tis the touch of God, on the weary 
   eyes,
That has caused them to close, in peace-
   ful slumber, 
   To open with joy, in the upper skies. 
We say he is gone; we have lost him for- 
   ever; 
His face and his form we will cherish no 
   more; 
While happy and safe, just over the river, 
   He is waiting for us, where partings 
   are o’er. 
Ah, sad are our hearts, as we gaze on
   him sleeping,
And bitter and sad are the tears gush-
   ing down; 
And yet,— but we cannot see, for the 
   weeping,—
   He has only exchanged the cross, for 
   the crown.
And though the dark mists of grief may 
   surround us, 
   Obscuring the face of the Father above, 
And blindly we grope, still His arms are 
   around us, 
   To guide and sustain with His pitying 
   love. 
And he whom we love, is safe in His 
   keeping, 
   Yes, safe and secure, whatever may 
   come; 
But ne’er will we know how sweetly he’s 
   sleeping. 
   Till God, in His mercy, shall gather us 
   home."
Going to the Picnic," 1 
 There is a large crowd of young folks 
 Hurrying down the road; 
 They are going to have a picnic now, 
 And spread the news abroad. 
 2 
 They are wearing beautiful bouquets, 
 And carrying bright tin dippers; 
 New straw hats are waiving high, 
 And patent leather slippers. 
3 
 Their hats are made of fine chiffon, 
 And decorated too. 
 There will be plenty of goodies 
 For your friends and for you. 
4
 They will have a big barbecue. 
 And a lot of other stuff. 
 They are going to eat and drink 
 Till everybody puff. 
5
 They will have cakes and candy by the heaps, 
 And ice cream pressed in cake; 
 Peanuts parched fresh and hot, 
 And a lot of fine milk shakes. 
 6 
 They will have fish croquets by the bushels, 
 And cocoanut jumbles too; 
 They are going to feed their friends and foes 
 And have enough for you. 
 7 
 They are going to have a big dance 
 And have a jolly time. 
 They want to show their handsome looks 
 Because they look so fine.  
 8 
 One barrel or two of lemonade, 
 Mixed all through with ice; 
 Lemons cut and thrown therein 
 Gee! it’s awful nice. 
9 
 Of all the fun and jolities, 
 And all the places of rest, 
 Just go to an old picnic ground; 
 They tell me that’s the best. "

Saturday Class: Janie Crawford is Grown,"In class today,
We mused on Janie and Tea Cake
And how love saves and wounds.
And I said,
Who is Janie’s true love?
And they said,
Tea Cake.
And I said
Are you sure?
And Eboni said,
She love herself like she ’posed to.
She wanted to be like the bee and the flower
But her granny wouldn’t let her.
And we all nodded.
Logan treated her like a mule
And Joe like a doll baby
And Tea Cake was her

She come back home.

Is this the end of the story?

Abolition of Slavery in District of Columbia,"Thank God! from our old ensign
      Is erased one mark of shame,
Which leaves one less to rapine,
      One less to blight our fame.
For two and sixty summers
      Has our broad escutcheon waved,
Amid the ceaseless murmurs
      And wails of the enslaved;
But in the blest hereafter
      Shall our oft afflicted ears,
Be solaced with bright laughter,

Apostrophe of Time,"O fleeting Time! whence art thou come?
      And whither do thy footsteps tend?
Deep in the past where was thy home,
      And where thy future journey's end?
Thou art from vast eternity,
      And unto boundless regions found;
But what and where’s infinity?
      And what know we of space unbound?
The furrowed brow betokens age;
      But who thy centuries can tell?
Was ancient seer or learned sage
      In wisdom’s lore e’er versed so well?
Hast thou from childhood wandered thus,
      Companionless and lone, through space,
With mystery o’er thy exodus,
      And darkness 'round thy resting place.
What lengthened years have come and gone,
      Since thou thy tireless march began,
Since Luna’s children sang at dawn,
      The wonders of creation’s plan?
How many years of gloom and night
      Had passed, long ere yon king of day
Had reigned his fiery steeds of light,
      And sped them on their shining way?
Thou knowest—Thou alone, O thou!
      Omniscient and eternal Three!
To whose broad eye all time is now—
      The past, with all eternity;
In whose dread presence I shall stand,
      When time shall sink to rise no more,
In that broad sea of thy command,
      Whose waves roll on, without a shore."

Sweet Singer,"Reign did silence o’er the stage
       As night passed on
And destiny fraught with laurels sat,
       Sweet laurels never won,
Till was read aloud her name
       And forth the sweet voiced singer came.
While grim old night worn out with age,
       Listening to the vibrating stage,
Wept because he must pass on.
       But hark! they do applaud her so:
She bows, she smiles and then looks round,
       She opens her lips and lo!
Bursts forth a trembling sea of sound:
       A sea voluptuous in its swell.
The waves rose high and then they fell;
       While beat the etherial shores, the tide,
And ebbing then the waves subside
       To music’s gentler flow.
O’er the vast and blue expanse
       Leaped the merry music on:
Around the universe, the flow
       Of that angelic tone;
Till heaven’s shores, the tidelets lashed
       And wavelets o’er the portals dashed.
The billowy waves break forth the sounds
       Reach the great white throne and rebound
Echoing the song of home."
The Blind Musician,"The vesper bells rang out the day
       The jostling crowd moved on its way:
The sexton flared the old church light;
       The lamps were lit and all was bright.
Then slowly thro’ the open door,
       The moving crowd began to pour;
And smiling youth and hoary age,
       Alike were crowding round the stage.
A blind musician, flushed and gay,
       Mounted the stage and picked his way
To where an old piano lone
       Awaited to adjust its tone.
His form swayed as moved by the breeze,
       Electric fingers swept o’er the keys,
And like the mighty tides of the sea
       That slowly swell and flood the lea,
He made the strains of music rise
       And swell till they had lashed the skies.
The crowd sat mute, their minds had flown
       On trembling notes to shores unknown,
Belated teamsters left their dray
       And toward the chapel sought their way;
A star peeped thro’ the clouds o’er head
       And seemed to trip and onward sped.
The blind musician lower bent,
       And swift the rolling music went
Like the gentle ebb and the flow
       Of ocean tides that come and go,
Or like the roll of drum and fife,
       Or sounds of conflict and of strife,
E’en more, the mocking bird would trill
       Its warbling lays and all was still
Till soft the sound of winds swept o’er,
       And broke a mighty tempest roar.
Lightening seemed in the player’s hand;
       A music cyclone struck the land.
Then came a creak as if were struck
       Some massive house, or trees were plucked
From their roots, and the thunder’s might
       Made those near by leap up in fright
Then came the lull, the storm was gone:
       The musician seemed sad and lone.
Thought he must of his darling wife,
       Whom he’d ne’er seen in all his life,
But as he sat in sad repose,
       Much he looked like the last fair rose.
Tho’ music vibrated ev’ry vein,
       A rose bloomed out on Sharon’s plain.
O, what genius in deed and thought!
       What mechanism by heaven wrought!
A soul of light, tho’ earth and skies
       Gave not light to his blinded eyes,
His fingers sought the keys once more,
       And played he then as ne’er before
And tossed he like a ship on the main,
       Till his soul echoed the last sad strain."
Astronomy,"Oh science sequestered much,
And by wisdom’s gentler touch,
         Accelerated more!
Did not they voice give the command
That man must venture from his strand
In quest of other distant land,
         Or was it ancient lore?
For sure into his peaceful breast,
Thou breathed the spirit of unrest,
         And bade him search the skies:
Thou pictured earth a moving sphere
Whose revolutions make the year,
And whispered to his listening ear,
          “Search heaven and be wise.”
Thy presence round him, charming fell.
And break did it the magic spell
         That ignorance had wrought:
And plain did seem the merry race
Of myriad planets thrown in space—
Just how each kept in his place,
         Has fostered wondrous thought.
And oft the would-be infidel
Has list the story that you tell
         And wisely gave a nod;
For now the planet checkered sky
And tangle comments hissing by
Have seized and borne his thoughts on high,
         Acknowledging a God.
No day has dawned, no sunbeam shone,
Where thought of man has not yet gone:
         And the rugged panoply,
Encasing of his mental frame,
Doth burst with unbounding fame
And conquers heaven in thy name,
         Science of the canopy.
Ah! could the Alexander brave
Be resurrected from his grave?
         Weep he would no more,
That no worlds to conquer still
He had; for science would fulfil
The very letter of his will,
         Of worlds, would give him more."
If Thou Shouldst Return,"If thou shouldst return with the sweet words of love,
    So earnestly spoken that day,
Methinks that thy words, this sad heart would move,
    For my pride has melted away;
And I’ve learned how true was the heart that I spurned,
And I’ve longed for the face that never returned.
If thou shouldst return to claim me thy bride,
    How gladly thy fate would I share;
How gladly I’d spend my whole life at thy side,
    How honored I’d feel to be there;
Oh, I’ve learned to revere the heart that I spurned!
    And I long for the face that never returned.
If thou shouldst return, ah, vain is the dream!
    I’ll cherish the fancy no more;
Though dark and forsaken my pathway may seem,
I’ll press bravely on as before;
    And trust in the One who forgives our mistakes,
And heals the deep wounds that our waywardness makes."
Hope,"The saddest day will have an eve,
     The darkest night, a morn;
Think not, when clouds are thick and dark,
     Thy way is too forlorn.
For ev’ry cloud that e’er did rise,
     To shade thy life’s bright way,
And ev’ry restless night of pain,
     And ev’ry weary day,
Will bring thee gifts, thou’lt value more,
     Because they cost so dear;
The soul that faints not in the storm,
     Emerges bright and clear."
Memorial Day,"Go;—for ’tis Memorial morning—
     Go with hearts of peace and love;
Deck the graves of fallen soldiers;
     Go, your gratitude to prove.
Gather flow’rs and take them thither,
     Emblem of a nation’s tears;
Grateful hearts cannot forget them,
     In the rush of passing years.
Strew the flow’rs above their couches;
     Let thy heart’s affection blend,
With the dewy buds and blossoms,
     That in fragrant showers descend.
Strew the flow’rs above the heroes,
     Slain for loving friends and thee;
Canst thou find a better off’ring,
     For those sons of liberty?
While the buds and blooms are falling,
     Earnest hearts are asking,—Why—
In a tone, though low and gentle,
     Yet, as ardent as a cry,—
‘Why must precious lives be given,
     That our country may be free?
Is there not a nobler pathway
     To the throne of liberty?
‘Can we choose no nobler watch-word,
     Than the ringing battle-cry,
Harbinger of strife and bloodshed,
     Must we sin, that sin may die?
‘Long ago, to far Judea,
     Came the blessed Prince of Peace:
Shall we ever heed His teaching,
     That these wars and feuds may cease?’"
"To a Certain Lady, in Her Garden","Lady, my lady, come from out the garden,
Clayfingered, dirtysmocked, and in my time
I too shall learn the quietness of Arden,
Knowledge so long a stranger to my rhyme.
What were more fitting than your springtime task?
Here, close engirdled by your vines and flowers
Surely there is no other grace to ask,
No better cloister from the bickering hours.
A step beyond, the dingy streets begin
With all their farce, and silly tragedy—
But here, unmindful of the futile din
You grow your flowers, far wiser certainly,
You and your garden sum the same to me,
A sense of strange and momentary pleasure,
And beauty snatched—oh, fragmentarily
Perhaps, yet who can boast of other seizure?
Oh, you have somehow robbed, I know not how
The secret of the loveliness of these
Whom you have served so long. Oh, shameless, now
You flaunt the winnings of your thieveries.
Thus, I exclaim against you, profiteer. . . .
For purpled evenings spent in pleasing toil,
Should you have gained so easily the dear
Capricious largesse of the miser soil?
Colorful living in a world grown dull,
Quiet sufficiency in weakling days,
Delicate happiness, more beautiful
For lighting up belittered, grimy ways—
Surely I think I shall remember this,
You in your old, rough dress, bedaubed with clay,
Your smudgy face parading happiness,
Life’s puzzle solved. Perhaps, in turn, you may.
One time, while clipping bushes, tending vines,
(Making your brave, sly mock at dastard days,)
Laugh gently at these trivial, truthful lines—
And that will be sufficient for my praise."
Nodes of Growth,"for Molly Peacock
My mother thinks she cannot grow 
orchids: the initial blooms shrivel,  
turn to dust on the window ledge.  
The stalk, once green, becomes 
a dry stick, soon appraised  
for the same value she gives  
every crinkled brown leaf: 
She cut it off. 
She did not know to wait 
to examine turgid base leaves,  
jungle vibrant, roots brimming  
the pot’s rim, testing the drainage holes,  
seeking sun, trickling water. 
It must work harder now 
to bloom once the stem  
has been removed. 
At middle age, I appreciate 
the orchid’s beauty: its shy blooms 
burst from a dead stick: 
nodes of growth emerge  
as tender youth did once. 
I got my first orchid at fifty. I was 
unable to accept the end of my body’s  
usefulness. The aura of attraction 
shriveled, I secretly  
cheered for the orchid  
whose tender nodes explode 
unexpected, fighting 
against our assumption that  
beauty only bursts from  
the sweet young green.  "
Alzheimer’s,"He sits, silent, 
no longer mistaking the cable 
news for company—
and when he talks, he talks of childhood, 
remembering some slight or conundrum 
as if it is a score to be retailed
and settled after seventy-five years.
Rare, the sudden lucidity 
that acknowledges this thing
that has happened
to me… 
More often, he recounts 
his father’s cruelty
or a chance deprived 
to him, a Negro
                  under Jim Crow. 
Five minutes ago escapes him 
as he chases 1934, unaware
of the present beauty out the window,
the banks of windswept snow—
or his wife, humming in the kitchen, 
or the twilit battles in Korea, or me
when he remembers that I am his son.
This condition—with a name that implies 
the proprietary, 
possession, 
                           spiritual
and otherwise—
as if it owns him,
which it does."

eschatology,"i’m confident that the absolute dregs of possibility for this society,
the sugary coffee mound at the bottom of this cup,
our last best hope that when our little bit of assigned plasma implodes 
it won’t go down as a green mark in the cosmic ledger,
lies in the moment when you say hello to a bus driver 
and they say it back—
when someone holds the door open for you 
and you do a little jog to meet them where they are—
walking my dog, i used to see this older man 
and whenever I said good morning, 
he replied ‘GREAT morning’—
in fact, all the creative ways our people greet each other
may be the icing on this flaming trash cake hurtling through the ether. 
when the clerk says how are you 
and i say ‘i’m blessed and highly favored’ 
i mean my toes have met sand, and wiggled in it, a lot. 
i mean i have laughed until i choked and a friend slapped my back.
i mean my niece wrote me a note: ‘you are so smart + intellajet’
i mean when we do go careening into the sun, 
i’ll miss crossing guards ushering the grown folks too, like ducklings 
and the lifeguards at the community pool and
men who yelled out the window that they’d fix the dent in my car, 
right now! it’d just take a second—
and actually everyone who tried to keep me alive, keep me afloat, 
and if not unblemished, suitably repaired.

“Integrated School Books” Arpeggio,"The Crisis Magazine, June 1967
On the cover, Negro men playing checkers
in the park. Some wear hats, while others wear
waves in their hair. Either way, they’re all clean
and their strategy brims as sharp as their 
suits. Within these pages, they’re playing chess,
protecting future children, as they wear
ties, dress shirts, shined shoes—looking clean
and ready for business or for battle. And their
plan? No longer will textbooks be used as chess
pieces to keep Negro children in check.
Sound familiar? Schools will be pushed to clean
bookshelves of the white-washed lessons of their
past. The NAACP opens minds like games of chess,
and all excuses for hiding a country’s checkered
past will be dismissed. Despite segregation’s wear
and tear from school boards, and the fear of their
white parents, henchmen, bullies—all just chess
pieces, really, but jumping laws like checkers
when life is more complex—books remain where
the mind cannot hide. Either you come clean
and admit your ignorance, or be a pawn on the chess
board of intellect, banning books. They think check-
mate! But when I see Crisis in a library archive where
we still argue to be seen, I lose patience. Kleenex,
please, for Karens clutching their pearls! I pray their
white kids are reading Langston Hughes in a public library: √.
But one state over, bookshelves have no Black authors, cleaned
out. Our books remain under attack, Kings in a game of chess."
Stars in Alabama,"In Alabama
Stars hang down so low,
So low, they purge the soul
With their infinity.
Beneath their holy glance
Essential good
Rises to mingle with them
In that skiey sea.
At noon
Within the sandy cotton-field
Beyond the clay, red road
Bordered with green,
A Negro lad and lass
Cling hand in hand,
And passion, hot-eyed, hot-lipped,
Lurks unseen.
But in the evening
When the skies lean down,
He’s but a wistful boy,
A saintly maiden she,
For Alabama stars
Hang down so low,
So low, they purge the soul
With their infinity."
Poet of Our Race,"Dedicated to the memory of Paul Laurence Dunbar
Oh, Poet of our Race,
We reverence thy name
As thy hist’ry we retrace,
Which enfolds thy widespread fame.
We loved thee, yea, too well,
But He dids’t love thee more
And called thee up with Him to dwell
On that Celestial shore.
Thy sorrows here on earth,
Yea, more than thou coulds’t bear,
Burdened thee from birth
E’en in their visions fair.
And thou, adored of men,
Whose bed might been of flowers,
With mighty stroke of pen
Expressed thy sad, sad hours.
Thou hast been called above,
Where all is peace and rest,
To dwell in boundless love,
Eternally and blest.
And, yet, thou still dost linger near,
For thy words, as sweetest flowers,
Do grow in beauty ’round us here
To cheer us in saddest hours.
Thy thoughts in rapture seem to soar
So far, yea, far above,
And shower a heavy downpour
Of sparkling, glittering love.
Thou, with stroke of mighty pen,
Hast told of joy and mirth,
And read the hearts and souls of men
As cradled from their birth.
The language of the flowers,
Thou hast read them all,
And e’en the little brook
Responded to thy call.
All Nature hast communed
And lingered, yea, with thee,
Their secrets were entombed
But thou hast made them free.
Oh, Poet of our Race,
Thou dost soar above;
No paths wilt thou retrace
But those of peace and love.
Thy pilgrimage is done,
Thy toils on earth are o’er,
Thy victor’s crown is won,
Thou’lt rest forever more."

[Song into holiness],"Song into holiness,
the sister has written her book—
nothing there of falsehood,
nothing invented by the poet.
Pain rides itself through the book,
though the one from Carthage
knows a blessèd life in God.
Should the author now look
carefully in a dark glass,
and the book close on a moment of joy?"
"My face is an iteration, but the song in my belly is ancestral","The Slave Castle in Elmina isn’t as beautiful as her name suggests
I enter the clay arms of Gorée Island’s ancient grounds
and let this be the last thought that steals my attention
The red fortress still leans against the volcanic rocks
as stunning as any glossy travel magazine cover
it’s hard to distinguish eloquent architecture from its destructive design
Listen, beauty can kill more beautiful things
It delights in possessing the bruised, sweet fruit, whether it bursts or rots
The stubborn door of Maison des Esclaves fastens shut after we enter
and I can’t help but look at the vicious maw
suspicious as a stolen bride
The spirituals in my chest 
are eager to return to a home I know
“The Door Of No Return” waits patiently ahead 
Have you ever stared at a hungrier death?
The dank, stony cell closest to the sea once cradled children and women
I imagine they were the color of my great-grandmother 
with cheekbones and noses as sharp as cutting knives
The murder pen is flanked by stone-structured quarters 
where island-bound women once thrived as keepers of the captured
where island-bound women were taught to slice her sister’s flight 
a math problem divided by no living answer
I can still see the blue-black neck of the gun barrel 
Hot hot and cutting through the castle’s meticulous slit
signaling the shark’s breakfast with screams from the bullet’s prey
as the current crash awaits blood gold from the enslaved
What other hell is there to believe in?
In the belly of the mausoleum, where the echoes lift the hair on my forearms
I hold my chest like a machete and weep for the lives stolen until shadows
I like to think I am a patient coup-ready woman 
But I know the heaven we jump towards is merely a holy crawl
You got to harrow deep within to free the deadly hope from your gut 
After months and months and months of steel rust blisters
Sometimes, the only peace you can count on lives 
in the jaws of a sea beast or a stolen country’s mineral pit
Hollow, be the manmade purgatory you believe in
I swear, on everything I love
hell looks nothing like this
    The Sound in my Body1 (Murmuration & Echo) 
  It delights in possessing the bruised sweet fruit no matter if it bursts or rots
and I can’t help but look at the vicious maw
The spirituals in my chest 
“The Door of No Return” waits patiently ahead 
The dank stony cell closest to the sea once cradled children and women
with cheekbones and noses as sharp as cutting knives
where island-bound women once thrived as keepers of the captured
a math problem with no living answer
Hot hot and cutting through the castle’s meticulous slit
as the current crash awaits blood gold from the enslaved
In the belly of the mausoleum, their echoes lift the hair on my forearms
I like to think I am a patient coup-ready woman 
You got to harrow deep within to free the deadly hope from your gut 
Sometimes, the only peace you can count on lives
Hollow,      be the manmade purgatory you believe in
I swear on everything I love
  1. The murmur is an acknowledgment of [Cathay] Williams’s being the only Black woman in the Buffalo Soldier’s 38th Infantry. The final construction consists of three parts. The first element, “The Sound,” is a thirty-eight-line poem written by the poet. The subsequent construction, “The Murmuration,” is a poem that takes the even numbers from the previous composition. These lines, nineteen in total, will then be divided into six tercets. “The Murmuration” closes with a declarative statement from line 37 of “The Sound.” The final piece, “The Echo,” is composed by taking the first line from each tercet in “The Murmuration.” The collection of these three elements will complete the full murmur."
First South,"The First South Carolina Volunteer Infantry Regiment, organized in August 1862
Of course, they were first—under that palmetto flag
whose palm fronds crossed into the stars
and bars, how could they not throw down
the hooked hoes, the baskets they shook to fan 
the rice? Who remembers
which man said yes first, remembers which twig
catches first when the forest lights?
Prince Rivers. Robert Sutton.
Caesar Johnson. Poll McKee. 
William Bronson. Bristow Eddy. 
Henry McIntyre. Robert Freeman.  
London Bailey. Cato Wright.
A partial roster. Defying naysayers at the north, 
daily reducing slavery’s prophecies
to history, no nibbling away at guns
in the Battle of the Hundred Pines
but infantry picking off Rebel cavalry, 
threshing blood from blood thirty miles above the mouth 
of the St. Marys River. Florida, late January. 
Their first skirmish. Smell of horses, smell of resin.
A minor battle, according to those who believe war
measured best by biggest massacre—
as if being first killed is the chief reason 
in being first. A partial memory: 
their colonel, deep in his notebooks, 
recording their grit—first shots, first dead—
for his report, rushing words across the pages
before he loses the sounds, the images
(the pines the men the moon the guns the blood),
before the mind forgets, as a sentinel forgets last week’s
countersign. Then paperwork for supplies. A partial
inventory—canteen, gun-sling, haversack, 
cartridge-box, cap-pouch, shoe-strings, 
bayonet—their discarded things, 
their molasses-and-water, their hardtack.
What they kept—regimental, personal.
Called a regiment marching into the future, 
needing no Proclamation to resist, they were 
piloting gunboats, requisitioning lumber;
first to push past anyone who said wait, 
they were loading their muskets with a will that means fight, 
they were marching into a country first to forget."
Projector,"Light takes new attribute
and yet his old
glory
enchants;
not this,
not this, they say,
lord as he was of the hieratic dance,
of poetry
and majesty
and pomp,
master of shrines and gateways
and of doors,
of markets
and the cross-road
and the street;
not this,
they say;
but we say otherwise
and greet
light
in new attribute,
insidious fire;
light reasserts
his power
reclaims the lost;
in a new blaze of splendour
calls the host
to reassemble
and to readjust
all severings
and differings of thought,
all strife and strident bickering
and rest;
O fair and blest,
he strides forth young and pitiful and strong, 
a king of blazing splendour and of gold,
and all the evil
and the tyrannous wrong
that beauty suffered
finds its champion,
light
who is god
and song.
He left the place they built him
and the halls,
he strode so simply forth,
they knew him not;
no man deceived him,
no,
nor ever will,
with meagre counterfeit
of ancient rite,
he knows all hearts
and all imagining
of plot
and counterplot
and mimicry,
this measuring of beauty with a rod, 
no formula
could hold him
and no threat
recall him
who is god.
Yet he returns,
O unrecorded grace, 
over
and under
and through us 
and about;
the stage is set now
for his mighty rays;
light,
light that batters gloom,
the Pythian
lifts up a fair head
in a lowly place,
he shows his splendour
in a little room;
he says to us,
be glad
and laugh,
be gay;
I have returned
though in an evil day
you crouched despairingly
who had no shrine;
we had no temple and no temple fire 
for all these said
and mouthed
and said again;
beauty is an endighter
and is power
of city
and of soldiery
and might,
beauty is city
and the state
and dour duty,
beauty is this and this and this dull thing, 
forgetting who was king.
Yet still he moves
alert,
invidious,
this serpent creeping
and this shaft of light,
his arrows slay
and still his footsteps
dart
gold
in the market-place;
vision returns
and with new vision
fresh
hope
to the impotent;
tired feet that never knew a hill-slope 
tread
fabulous mountain sides;
worn
dusty feet
sink in soft drift of pine
needles
and anodyne
of balm and fir and myrtle-trees
and cones
drift across weary brows
and the sea-foam
marks the sea-path
where no sea ever comes;
islands arise where never islands were,
crowned with the sacred palm
or odorous cedar;
waves sparkle and delight
the weary eyes
that never saw the sun fall in the sea 
nor the bright Pleaiads rise."

Love’s Growth,"I scarce believe my love to be so pure
   As I had thought it was,
   Because it doth endure
Vicissitude, and season, as the grasse;
Methinks I lied all winter, when I swore,
My love was infinite, if spring make’it more.
But if this medicine, love, which cures all sorrow
With more, not onely bee no quintessence,
But mixt of all stuffes, paining soule, or sense,
And of the Sunne his working vigour borrow,
Love’s not so pure, and abstract, as they use
To say, which have no Mistresse but their Muse,
But as all else, being elemented too,
Love sometimes would contemplate, sometimes do
And yet no greater, but more eminent,
   Love by the spring is grown;
   As, in the firmament,
Starres by the Sunne are not inlarg’d, but showne,
Gentle love deeds, as blossomes on a bough,
From love’s awakened root do bud out now.
If, as in water stir’d more circles bee
Produc’d by one, love such additions take,
Those like so many spheares, but one heaven make,
For, they are all concentrique unto thee,
And though each spring doe adde to love new heate,
As princes do in times of action get
New taxes, and remit them not in peace,
No winter shall abate the spring’s encrease."
Club Paradise,"Early days of July, heatwave membraned 
the city, Aura and Zephyr lockjawed 
and left the girl looking a mouldered grey.
Only the wind of expiation blows,
or at least attempts to smooth our rafters. 
Still, ardour conspires with every breath
and makes my voice a giant scallop shell,
scoffed with apologies and songs. Hear me
out: I am as faithful as a coral reef. 
A behemoth backfires in Eden
and sets off total colony collapse.
Hell seems happier. Well, hell, go to hell
then! Easy: hell is in the air outside. 
I will stay, resuscitate our hive 
with what I know of work: transparent words
next to transparent words, ransomed for love,
the sake of love, fresh, renewed, startled back
into place by a breathless, heavy blow
from my hautboy. Gold tremble off my lips. 
We are way out beyond limits now. Too 
far for tears, except the sun brings them on.
It is me. Taken by paranoid seizure,
weeping at the dark deluxe of the sun
like an actor or a Rasta, chanting:  
Paradise once, paradise once again!
But this is rose-pink Florence, infernal 
as ever, interred by the living light
we have half blocked out with half drawn shutters
to make the ecliptic line visible,
so even here we may be “unalarmed
by the vicissitudes of the future.”
Now that’s viva luce. Casual rapture. 
Surety and fidelity are terms,
on pain of death, not to be avoided.  
Pop a paxlovid, beloved, read this
as I tell you that I am the Seraph 
Abdiel, indignant before the devil. 
Do you feel weak in body or mind? 
In spirit? Well, that was unexpected. 
My angelic recommendations are 
cold baths and the movies of Gene Tierney. 
Abdiel I said? Let me now abdicate 
from that tower, for my mind is constant 
changes, as now single in retorted 
scorn for current major minor poets. 
One must have a talent to unmask shades. 
It is your savage gift, and mine, to conceal 
openly berries from childhood forest, 
our heads shawled like witches in the green,
mosquitoes pitched partisans’ melodies,
a half tropical bluff in my left ear.
Solomon’s Mine flourished in my right ear. 
You are as impatient as I am not. 
Everything moves is firm philosophy. 
But moves how? In a flagellum pattern?
I can’t imagine that. Yet I can see
furtive fern, under shadowed, move as such;
as such, when I was a schoolboy, iron 
filings straggled on my desk, ant or rain
drawn, I supposed, by a phantom magnet. 
I know now that it was the Holy Ghost. 
You’ve called me a Christian fabulist 
before, and I’ve played the clown, it’s true, 
but only for your serious amusement,
nightly pointing out the fading dog star. 
I aim each morning to salute the sun. 
What I call progress is antiquity 
in reverse, the wheels off, transfigured light
through the dark sky, flared; immolated; gone. 
In Club Paradise, my father alone
of all the extras had a speaking part. 
A single phrase, a question, when he asked 
got lost in his dreads. Heuristic technique
you could say. Don’t laugh, he’s an amputee
now, still delusional but on good pension.
Flesh of my flesh, love. I cannot go far, 
and I have gone far, and not hear my blood shriek 
with the thought that all of this could be cut  
by a second-string executioner.
My heart rides at anchor telling you this.  
My heart is riding at anchor to tell. "
"In the Woods of Language, She Collects Beautiful Sticks","like a snail with a shell of sticks

    — she loads them on her back —

Like a camel with a hump of sticks

    — on her back, on her back —

Like a horse with a knight of sticks and a stick for a sword

Where is she taking this load of sticks?

Interview,"I want this job because 
it sounds like something I could do 
and I’m hungry, physically. 
I have extensive experience 
in studying what water says as it plummets.
Yes, I can carry more than 35lbs, but what 
does that have to do with anything? 
I’ve wrestled angelic beings 
and the nine lives of pathological compulsion.
I have sworn an oath against the roman calendar 
and its derivative mutations. 
I can be firm as cold turkey. 
My two letters of recommendation are
f and u. They can be used in surf, which 
is one way to step on what wants me drowned. 
I have heard the hinges of the doors of the sea 
creak, so I read a book beneath a tree. 
I think a lie can be worse than murder but also 
I have never died. I can definitely think of a time 
when I had to multitask while under immense pressure, 
but would prefer not to. My goal is to recall my past lives 
and be free in each. My strength is being scattered 
and rooted at the same time. My weakness is entertaining 
a party of every kind of consequence. 
My kink is a copless land where no one hoards anything.
I can start on any day you are prepared to train.
I can end on any day that ends in why not, 
for real, I don’t need this, 
the people got me you know, 
I’m with the people. "
To the Air,"His fisherman’s cap 
is gray as is the sea 
where he stares. He once 
saw a mermaid 
there     near
the shore tangled 
in kelp. She wanted him 
to not see her. She wasn’t 
a gift. He wasn’t. Yet 
he stared. Keeps returning 
to stare at the now
nothing he sees. Nothing 
as in not her.
He once said he loved 
her     sea life.
He’s captured     capturer.
Blame agony.  
Blame perpetual 
return to the kelp 
stuck to his feet     for 
the wind over 
ears     in canals.
She’s singing 
a water hymn  
not to him
but to the air.  
This is where 
he dissolves.  "
The Lost Breath of Trees,"an oratorio for vanishing voices, collapsing universes, and a falling tree.
                          —Lena Herzog, Last Whispers
1.
in the days before urban sprawl this town
remained no more than cow pastures
logs skidding down to the harbor
gulls riding them like surfboards
a green belt embraced the one road north
a hundred years they say until the lease expired
in those days trees lining each side threw shade over
hippies and geese bound to the same direction
this was the rainforest and we took
for granted the trees that sheltered the sun
in shimmering light the music of wind
and leaves that left air breathable 
we thought the developers would never come
that Eden would last forever
2.
if I remember well the first to go
was the old growth Ponderosa near the school
     what a racket all that sawing and sawing
     no sapling that one stubborn tough
     from thick outer ring to the core
on overhead wires larks crows and common wrens 
lined up like jurors surveying a crime scene
chortling and cackling a chorus of what’s
      this what’s this come see come see
     every so often one broke rank
     and swooped toward the cantilevered trunk
as if they could bring back to life those limbs
where each night they had fought to gain purchase 
     circling as if remembering the canopy 
     before the thieving ravens evicted them
     swirling in all directions birds
leaves one and the same into a vortex until
the tree shivered one last time and fell
      still I listen for the rustle of leaves
      sweeping clean the air
3. 
among the shadows of WWII bombers crashed
on test flights old growth forests thrive
in the deep waters of Lake Washington
know that the ghosts of forests reside in every city

now and again a crack in the pavement
yields to a sprig with one leaf unfurling
to what might have been the lush undergrowth
of rainforest or village green

stumps of roots fingering toward the sky
remnants knuckled in a path
stubborn as the gnarled toes of an old man
struggling across the road 

bark tough as leather peeled and frayed
the banyan the elm the oak and spruce
the cypress the pine the redwood and willow
a sigh a whisper a breath of fresh air
4.
one morning on the sun-drenched asphalt
a blue feather lay as if fallen by magic
from some child’s dream of angels
was there ever a bird so blue so
cobalt perfect from downy barbs to vanes
to fall undamaged by progress 
among the squalor of high-rises and noise 
of backhoes awakening each morning 
was this an omen an augury a straw in the wind
to land here where few trees thrive
you look up at the birdless sky think:
this is a city   this a mountain
this a remnant of the rainforest"
To a Snowflake,"What heart could have thought you?—
Past our devisal
(O filigree petal!)
Fashioned so purely,
Fragilely, surely,
From what Paradisal
Imagineless metal,
Too costly for cost?
Who hammered you, wrought you,
From argentine vapour?—
“God was my shaper.
Passing surmisal,
He hammered, He wrought me,
From curled silver vapour,
To lust of His mind;—
Thou could’st not have thought me!
So purely, so palely,
Tinily, surely,
Mightily, frailly,
Insculped and embossed,
With His hammer of wind,
And His graver of frost.”"
Dead Boy,"translated from the Japanese by Jeffrey Angles
I am a boy, having never known love, 
Who has suddenly fallen from the summit  
Of frightening infancy into the darkness of a well 
Dark, watery hands choke my delicate neck 
Innumerable needles of cold push into me, 
Killing my heart, wet as a fish 
Inside, each organ swells like a flower 
As I move horizontally below the earth 
Along the surface of the water  
Eventually, from the green horn in my groin 
A sprout, unreliable and delicate, will grow 
Clawing up the heavy soil with thin hands 
One day, like a pallid face, 
Its tree will rustle under the painful light 
For I desire as much space inside me  
For light as space for shadow
    死んだ少年
  ぼくは　愛も知らず
怖ろしい幼年時代の頂きから　突然
井戸の暗みに落ちこんだ少年だ
くらい水の手が　ぼくのひよわなのどをしめ
つめたさの無数の雛が　押し入って来ては
ぼくの　魚のように濡れた心臓をあやめる
ぼくは　すべての内臓で　花のようにふくれ
地下水の表面を　水平にうごいていく
ぼくの股の青くさいつのからは　やがて
たよりない芽が生え　重苦しい土を
かぼそい手で　這いのぼっていくだろう 
青ざめた顔のような一本の樹が
痛い光の下にそよぐ日が来るだろう 
ぼくは　影の部分と同じほど
ぼくの中に　光の部分がほしいのだ"
Montpeyroux Sonnets 7,"For Julie Fay
Tired of asparagus and aubergines,
tired of tomatoes, even tired of wine,
tired of the village in its niche between
the Causses and the Mediterranean,
she stays in bed, the window blanked, till noon,
then lights a cigarette, emerges from
the sunken twenty-three hours’ dark bedroom
into the sitting-room, coffee machine
humming, and, on lucky days, the sun
doing its best to be sustaining. Gloom
waits in the shadow. Yes, I’ve also seen
degenerescence in a wrinkled prune,
a wedge of mouldy bread, a chicken bone
—and she’s grabbed life back on the telephone.
  
I might seize life back from the telephone
when someone—what someone?—any someone,
not killing time, wants a conversation.
It’s cold. It’s raining. The vineyards need rain,
and apple, peach orchards, tomatoes, corn. . . .
I took my morning walk. I left my cane
at the grocer’s, hooked on a crate of clementines,
only remembered it walking between
the square and this street, so, went back again.
I thought for those five minutes that my spine
was redeemed, renewal, not decline.
No twinges, phantom swellings, inflammation.
Absence of constriction. Absence of pain.
A long walk in the sunlight toward the mountain.
  
A long walk in the sunlight toward the mountain
might be one more invented memory
(but I did walk there), or a fantasy
cobbled out of desire, some book, invention
and memory, still. Yes, it’s going to rain
again. Like an old woman in a story,
I feel it in my shoulders, my left knee—
a vague ache, numbness, nothing more certain
or defined. Swallows who’ve built their nests
under the roof tiles of the house across
the way, swoop, zigzag, perch, then disappear.
This street, like others, is a palimpsest,
not “mine,” but one of mine, how many years?
The smell of cigarette smoke wafts upstairs.
  
The smell of cigarette smoke wafts upstairs—
Awake, alert, the morning round the bend,
what do you say to your friend, as you watch your friend
give in to existential despair?
. . . I think on the roof terrace, in the glare
of just-past-noon. Nothing has happened
but coffee, weather (rainstorms), and unend-
ing conversations on a screen. Elsewhere
(again) he, she, London, Houston, Oslo,
Paris, which always healed me, till it stopped,
send news: books, travel, politics, explosion.
There’s war close by, though nobody I know
is in it—yet. The temperature dropped.
The clouds move, and I follow their motion.
  
The clouds move, and I follow their motion
out on the terrace, littered with laundry-frames
and clotheslines, parched plants, two geraniums
bravely in leaf. Birdshit. Green hose on
the ground. Black wrought iron chair, cushion that goes on
it, waterlogged now. Clouds overhead. Here comes
the storm. Thunder. A week of rain. It drums
on the skylight, splattering commotion.
Hailstorm. It has been “a cold spring.”
Julie’s daughter, an ocean away,
plus half a continent (grew up here), is filling
her in—the complexities of her twenties,
chores, choices, everyday possibility
cross-country drives, a boyfriend, other skies.
  
Cross-country drives with Julie, other skies
of other decades—Greenville to Tucson,
a campsite in a state park, on a mountain,
improvised food, insects, epiphanies
of southwest sunsets, and the backstories,
—all-American cliché—that we’d recount, in
earnest belief it had been ours to choose. On
the road from somewhere to elsewhere, worries
in duffle bag, car boot. I’d like to take
off now, across a valley, up and over
a mountain (the roads are good, and I’ve
good walking shoes). Conifers, a small lake,
birdsong. A fox? a squirrel? runs for cover,
Except, of course, I never learned to drive.
  
Except, of course, I never learned to drive—
I was eleven. Life changed. My father died.
My mother inconveniently went mad.
I got through high school and got out alive.
Some distant college might have seen me thrive,
(take driving lessons that I never had).
What didn’t happen’s heavily beside
the point. I’m old, arthritic, more gratified
by an alert and unimpeded Now,
walking up the school road, with a cane,
looking at mountains, with a bit of longing
for how I once walked, but walking every morning
and afternoon: church, buvette, stone house, bungalow,
buying asparagus, an aubergine. . . ."
And You . . .,"a walk in a midwinter ochre wood
to get some england sun
as it steals away—
a little poodle runs to show you love;
you like the feel of the animal’s body
on your leg; it’s something
of an acceptance so you smile
and are not the least bothered; you even hope
it’ll jump, though the lady yells
no jumping Sam! no jumping!
and when she adds ‘you know he
just loves EVERYbody!’ why should you
suddenly feel tears coming?—
it’s just that EVERYbody; how do you
explain this? there’s nobody to explain
it to: why she needed to take away
from you this one feeling of special?
how could she know it was the most
human moment of your day—
the most human moment in weeks?"
Phragmites,"I’ve crashed a party with an infinity pool and several nude men:
a Fire Island home at the back of a walkway long enough to
outlast a pop song’s bridge and some chorus, flanked by
phragmites on either side, tall and same-faced, so all
but reed bulk hides out from the exterior. Myself
included, close to everyone here has a body of
one approximate build. What would it say if I
stay? Comfort’s not so comfy here, but I stay
and try to have a good time: periodic beach
guest, mainly through favors from men
whose wealth eclipses mine and most
of humankind. I know firsthand why
queers come to this place, obliterate
coherence, take, go, take, till
we’ve consumed enough
to leave.
Someone riding the stiffest
substance cocktail he can muster
GROANS he’s got to pee and can’t,
his functions stalled in the twist and now.
What he can still swing is a smile. Excess
soaks the sundecks and each redwood inch
of the mini villa with a sweet-hot stickiness.
There’s much more to take in, with nowhere to go."
Hermaphrodite,"All Eyes on Earth be urgently Attracted to 
that Hermaphroditic form I longed for having. 
I have it. Derision won’t change the Body I swarm;
Nor Scorn, nor More Violence, or Lies 
Can try me Small. I ease around, Octoroon 
    Of Sex’s quick Ball, très Black, confronted with these added Eyes
Batted against the temple Grace of my Body, my breasts—
     O am I a looked-at Dignity! demanding Serenade.
That tight thru-space between Seer and what’s Seen 
Might be Sensation’s rise, or Shame, or is Solicitation’s chance,
    the calculus arguing gender, sans 
the petty Knowledge divides my thighs. Remember me, 
the god Phanes, who created, cries; Use me,
    the god Hermaphrodite, who revises, replies:
I am their audience. Ain’t nothing here subpar!
Light breaks over all Eyes like sound plays the Guitar."
Genius Loci,"i.m. D S C H
I
Music’s poltergeist among the grand spirits,
can you now tell what such possession is
                    or was
saying: I know the woman who stands here
in Pushkin’s clock-haunted house,
shadowy figure nimbus’d by light’s mode
amid the wan company thinning at dawn.
The air sways, a lamp holds vigil
with its smoky flame.
The fiddle is in velvet, the cello
has ceased to urge her proud commodious song.
II
The cello’s long since ceased to urge her proud
commodious song. It is like a love story 
that ends up tragic; or some common débâcle
heroic by decree.
There’s breach of custom that privileges laughter.
In art we hazard so much void of compulsion. 
The silence and down-turned thumb are not
compulsion but luck, or the climate, being in the wrong place.
The sublime wearies, so we have farting on brass
like one of Stalin’s jokes. This is a sketched-in
historical thesis. You will call it parody.
III
You will call this parody yet your own music
is like a spectral dance more than a dance of spirits
                    when it is not
like a wide city under a bronze sky,
when it is not the Neva or a high voicing
of a passion-nocturne by Aleksandr Blok;
the unheard-of threnos brought into hearing
and, once heard, a presentiment from nature
          no more to be wondered at
but in the broad way of wonder and acceptance.
Not parody precisely. It is true I think
IV
that I have now confused you with Zhivago
and Pushkin and my own ambition
to write Onegin and fifteen string quartets
and some sparely glittering poem about Christmas
                    or Easter;
to get the drum-raps right for cracking the spring ice:
more fitful as a human testament
than heart-murmur or tinnitus, or the way one’s jaw
creaks when eating. Finally I declare homage
to the late Frank O’Hara, intelligent, choosy
lover of Russia and of Russian music.
V
Who is this woman who stands here in Pushkin’s 
clock-haunted house? I do not know.
                    I cannot
tell presence from memory amid the wan
company thinning at dawn. She is a muse
of sorts, that much is certain. Her hand
is nimbus’d in a gesture of rebuke
or blessing, and the lamp holds vigil
          with its well-trimmed flame.
The house-door stands ajar. The cello has now long
languished from her immemorable aubade. "
The Quids,"The little quids, the million quids,
The everywhere, everything, always quids,
The atoms of the Monoton,
Each turned three essences where it stood,
And ground a gisty dust from its neighbors’ edges,
Until a powdery thoughtfall stormed in and out,
The cerebration of a slippery quid enterprise.
Each quid stirred.
The united quids
Waved through a sinuous decision.
The quids, that had never done anything before
But be, be, be, be, be,
The quids resolved to predicate
And dissipate in a little grammar.
Oh, the Monoton didn’t care,
For whatever they did—
The Monoton’s contributing quids—
The Monoton would always remain the same.
A quid here and there gyrated in place-position,
While many essential quids turned inside-out
For the fun of it
And a few refused to be anything but
Simple, unpredicated copulatives.
Little by little, this commotion of quids,
By threes, by tens, by casual millions,
Squirming within the state of things,
The metaphysical acrobats,
The naked, immaterial quids
Turned inside on themselves
And came out dressed,
Each similar quid of the inward same,
Each similar quid dressed in a different way—
The quid’s idea of a holiday.
The quids could never tell what was happening.
But the Monoton felt itself differently the same
In its different parts.
The silly quids upon their rambling exercise
Never knew, could never tell
What their pleasure was about,
What their carnival was like,
Being in, being in, being always in
Where they never could get out
Of the everywhere, everything, always in,
To derive themselves from the Monoton.
But I know, with a quid inside of me,
But I know what a quid’s disguise is like,
Being one myself,
The gymnastic device
That a quid puts on for exercise.
And so should the trees,
And so should the worms,
And so should you,
And all the other predicates,
And all the other accessories
Of the quid’s masquerade."
The Habit of Perfection,"Elected Silence, sing to me
And beat upon my whorlèd ear,
Pipe me to pastures still and be
The music that I care to hear.
Shape nothing, lips; be lovely-dumb:
It is the shut, the curfew sent
From there where all surrenders come
Which only make you eloquent.
Be shellèd, eyes, with double dark
And find the uncreated light:
This ruck and reel which you remark
Coils, keeps, and teases simple sight.
Palate, the hutch of tasty lust,
Desire not to be rinsed with wine:
The can must be so sweet, the crust
So fresh that come in fasts divine!
Nostrils, our careless breath that spend
Upon the stir and keep of pride,
What relish shall the censers send
Along the sanctuary side!
O feel-of-primrose hands, O feet
That want the yield of plushy sward,
But you shall walk the golden street
And you unhouse and house the Lord.
And, Poverty, be thou the bride
And now the marriage feast begun,
And lily-coloured clothes provide
Your spouse not laboured-at nor spun."
We’re All Maroons,"translated from the Spanish by Wendy Call and Shook
Oh god if you exist
I’ve never doubted your existence
                          —Nancy Morejón
No one knows their names
or their pleas that would open every border
in heaven and hell
To the passerby they’re just Black men
newly arrived in Barcelona
no job
no Spanish on their tongues
Maroons who walk the street
hawking trinkets
their hunger and angst put on display
before the gaze of nosy tourists
They have a God
I have a God
and I rue their bad luck
having to run every time the Mossos
    d’Esquadra
chase them to jail
lumping them in with thieves and
    murderers
Sometimes I go down La Gran Avenida
or down the Barceloneta or down Las
    Ramblas
and I see all those Black men
spreading their white blankets on the ground 
as if they’ll soon return to sea
flying the sail of the promised land
the land that became a mirage
So all they have left is the drifting
dinghy of their hearts
the castaway’s jagged rocks
where each is a distressed bird
But they have a God
that they hold close
with the faith of a child
and the hope of a suicide
That’s why even in the rain
they all sing their bad luck
and none of them care about this city
that can’t pronounce their names
Because they have a God that smells of
   acacia
that tastes of ether and loneliness
And they each have a white blanket
that easily opens and closes
hawking trinkets
to sustain the hungry
a sheet that can be folded and tied up
so they can run far
far away from the Mossos d’Esquadra
from xenophobia
from the blindness of God
    Todos somos cimarrones
Oh dios si existes
No he dudado de tu existencia
                          —Nancy Morejón
Nadie conoce sus nombres
ni sus ruegos que abrirían todas las
   aduanas
del cielo y del infierno
Para los viandantes sólo son negros
recién llegados a Barcelona
sin empleo
sin español en la lengua
cimarrones que van por la calle
con su venta improvisada de baratijas
gente que extiende su hambre y su
   asombro
ante la mirada de turistas y fisgones
Ellos tienen un Dios
yo tengo un Dios
y me lamento por su mala suerte
de correr cada vez que los mossos
   d’esquadra
vienen tras de ellos a encarcelarlos
a juntarlos con ladrones y homicidas
A veces voy por la Gran Avenida
o por la Barceloneta o por las Ramblas
y veo a todos aquellos hombres negros
que extienden su manta blanca sobre el piso
como si de pronto volvieran al mar
y ondearan las velas de la tierra prometida
la tierra que un día se les volvió espejismo
Entonces sólo les queda la barca
de sus corazones a la deriva
la piedra del naufragio
donde cada uno es un pájaro que gime
Pero ellos tienen un Dios
que guardan bajo su sombra
con la fe de un niño
y la esperanza de un suicida
Por eso aún bajo la lluvia
todos cantan su mala suerte
y a ninguno le importa esta ciudad
que no sabe pronunciar sus nombres
Porque ellos tienen un Dios que huele a
    acacias
que sabe a éter y soledad
Y también tienen una manta blanca
que se abre y cierra fácilmente
una venta improvisada de baratijas
para sostener el hambre
una manta que se dobla y amarra
para poder correr lejos
muy lejos de los mossos d’esquadra
de la xenofobia
y de la ceguera de Dios

 "
Aisha,"translated from the Spanish by Wendy Call and Shook
Guards the bitter taste of her sex
beneath her tongue
in Spain as in Morocco
remains the coppery girl
with wide hips
and sharp eyes
She left Marrakesh
like someone fleeing her own shadow
she avoids streetlamps and the full moon
the scent of green tea and hashish
she feels at home and in her skin
Her mother warned her of the dangers
of getting too close to bridges
             and balconies
                            and lovers
her mother shared with her
the bitter taste on her tongue
the burning in her belly
of a woman saving herself for her first love
She will anoint her wedding dress
with the scent of hashish and cinnamon
so that her groom does not discover
the scent of other men that lingers on her
   skin
She will offer her mother
the scent of hashish and mint
so that her belly might foster a son
the scent of hashish and cinnamon
so that Allah will give her a son
so that Allah will bless her man’s seed
    Aisha
Guarda debajo de su lengua
la sensación amarga de su sexo
en España como en Marruecos
sigue siendo la muchacha cobriza
de anchas caderas
y ojos exactos
Dejó Marrakech
cómo quién huyendo de su propia sombra
evita los faroles y la luna llena
Olor a hachís y té verde
se siente en su casa y en su piel
Su madre le advirtió de los peligros
de acercarse demasiado a los puentes
                y a los balcones
                             y a los amores
su madre le compartió
la sensación amarga en la lengua
el ardor en su vientre
de mujer guardándose para su primer amor
Olor a hachís y canela
le untará a su vestido de boda
para que el esposo no revele
el olor que su piel guarda de otros hombres
Olor a hachís y hierbabuena
le ofrecerá a su madre
para que su vientre albergue un hijo
olor a hachís y canela
para que Alah le dé un niño
para que Alah bendiga la semilla de su
   varón

Clarity,"Sorrow, O sorrow, moves like a loose flock
of blackbirds sweeping over the metal roofs, over the birches, 
                    and the miles. 
    One wave after another, then another, then the sudden 
                                                            opening
where the feathered swirl, illumined by dusk, parts to reveal 
the weeping 
                     heart of all things."
Giornata 4,"An old husband’s tale reckons that witches are children 
of sexless angels and their human eunuchs, angels 
whose self-restraint was inversely proportional to the power 
to silence their victims. Papa’s maybes of a Zeus-like
ravishment from above. Immaculate. Paul said women
should wear an “authority” on their heads, by which he meant a veil,
like a force field to protect them from lustful angels. Adam
copped angel lust from those self-same freaky mayflies
who by turns learned their grift at God’s extensive
digit bulbing like molten glass at the end of a blowpipe.
God got his from Greeks. Thus completes, like a network
of shell companies, the history of qualified
immunity. Every man should learn to balance a set of books
that looks like an anvil–instead of a veil–on our heads
for posture in the figurative sense, standing in God’s eyes
where God, like the future, is female—a prophylactic
against patriarchy, a cork stopper in the mouth of a gun."
The Lord’s Corner,"I would drop to my knees for the littlest things 
mind filled with a light returning
from aluminum-foil crosses hanging on a porch 
I was made to believe so hard 
that I was going to die 
My family said I wore bells on my ankles
                                        I learned an ancient dance 
Then the light like the deer 
leaped off     into time 
& once   because my cousins called my body a soft thing
because so desperately they said they wanted to kill 
the woman I hid inside me 
dared as they often did with their hands 
to let my eyes wonder 
where the thickest shine sat 
we heard the last child had their mind stolen 
the circles of their iris turned to coal
when they looked directly at the Lord’s house 
I’m trying to find where I feel most at home
I believe it’s inside me"
This dark is the same dark as when you close,"your eyes I whisper to our son while he

          catches his breath. It is well past midnight

and he will not describe the face of what

          he fights to unsee. By his feet, the green
  glow of a nightlight retreats into blue,

          slips softly to red. Above his bed: notes

we once had time to tape onto the latch

          of his lunchbox, flights of origami

swans, throwing stars and fortune tellers. When
            your turn comes to lie beside him, this is

the bridge he’s set to repeat: Always an

          angel, never a god—and so you hold

him close like a saint shadowed by the axe,

          cradling her own haloed head in her hands."
Somewhere Everywhere,"“I will take with me the emptiness of my hands
What you do not have you find everywhere”
             — W. S. Merwin
And the fireflies cried.
Only owl shrieks and wing howls
Now. And one once-upon town — ash.  —
When does a fire peel to reveal skin
Of a running child under its flame-raged arms —
Child legs too short to reach mama or  
Neighbor or any hands to save her?
Stilled hands. Not the town’s famed banyan  
Branches, their hundred twined and dancing arms.  
Not sky not sea not friend not that goddess her
Tutu taught her loved fire, but loved her, more —
Only her blister-scorched skin,  
Only her lost-slipper race,
Blind to a wind blacked 
Sea where she would dive or die.  
Too quiet now for night-birds
Mothers or men — to find.
Not immortal.  
Only one child of the land
And the many large and  
Small bones under ash.
                                             ~
It seemed immortal, the old ones
whispered, older than its wars
Or star of gladness seekers who
Crossed waters to follow midnights
To a far isle — in hollowed out trees
Filled with their chickens their pigs their
Plants and all their many brown hands 
— Landed —     Green island in
The middle of wild seas birthing
Oceans —     birthing mountains  
— Then mirror     to days of calm
To come.
Shine between sunrise,
Rain between gods, love between stars,
And red fish, and gods of trickery,
And gods of blessed breaths.
— Maui — island home for a hundred/
Hundred gardens, valleys, volcanoes, tall
Stones and skies — If immortal, why didn’t?
    — If blessed, why couldn’t — ?
                                           ~
  
When does fire lie quiet at
Last or at last — its non
Immortal breath burned like sunrise.  
Its gull cry     here      a new day?
Wake, storm birds, wake infant hands    
And wake, old ones — Wake,
Island — to plant what will
Grow from cinder and stinking ash.
Planet : mirroring its
wars of every kind. . . .
What you do not have you find . . . everywhere. . . ."
From “The Land” [Shepherds and stars are quiet with the hills],"Shepherds and stars are quiet with the hills.
There is a bond between the men who go
From youth about the business of the earth,
And the earth they serve, their cradle and their grave;
Stars with the seasons alter; only he
Who wakeful follows the pricked revolving sky,
Turns concordant with the earth while others sleep;
To him the dawn is punctual; to him
The quarters of the year no empty name.
A loutish life, but in the midst of dark
Cut to a gash of beauty, as when the hawk
Bears upwards in its talons the striking snake,
High, and yet higher, till those two hang close,
Sculptural on the blue, together twined,
Exalted, deathly, silent, and alone.
And since to live men labour, only knowing
Life’s little lantern between dark and dark,
The fieldsman in his grave humility
Goes about his centennial concerns,
Bread for his race and fodder for his kine,
Mating and breeding, since he only knows
The life he sees, how it may best endure,
(But on his Sabbath pacifies his God,
Blindly, though storm may wreck his urgent crops,)
And sees no beauty in his horny life,
With closer wisdom than soft poets use.
But I, like him, who strive
Closely with earth, and know her grudging mind,
Will sing no songs of bounty, for I see
Only the battle between man and earth,
The sweat, the weariness, the care, the balk;
See earth the slave and tyrant, mutinous,
Turning upon her tyrant and her slave,
Yielding reluctantly her fruits, to none
But most peremptory wooers.
Wherever waste eludes man’s vigilance,
There spring the weeds and darnels; where he treads
Through woods a tangle nets and trips his steps;
His hands alone force fruitfulness and tilth;
Strange lovers, man and earth! their love and hate
Braided in mutual need; and of their strife
A tired contentment born."
If You Have Had Your Midnights,"        if you have had 
            your midnights
    and they have drenched
        your barren guts
           with tears
  I sing you sunrise
         and love
and someone to touch"
Western Avenue,"After the Ex
             the singing lights
Colonel Abrams burning
             pleas in our ears
I hear baby please
             take me right now

Elegy: Boston,"August, one of those evenings I walked
the long way home, over the Harvard Bridge,
your image dissolving sweetly like a lozenge
on my tongue. This friendship, I reminded
myself, is everything but wrong.
In like with, not in love with: you.
I already had somebody, what else is there
to do? Suffer, and let the river air it out.
Like a spectator I hovered at the balustrade,
waiting for an early evening regatta,
bright sails, black keels cutting
beneath the railing, turning me
from my yearning, steeling my reeling
mind. Below, breezes herringboned
the rusty water, rush hour traffic knotted behind
me at the center of the bridge. These and other observations
I jotted in my journal, remembering your dark
fingers around my own like riggings, our calls,
brief torrents, anchoring my afternoons. Can I think
through your absence now, in words
as ungainly as these: Institute, 364.4 Smoots, abandoned band shell,
deleted emails, KS, Acyclovir? That night I stalled, not wanting to reach
Boylston, buy books and wine and candy and circle like a gull above
feeling. I stood there, as I sit here now, watching the red-brick
beacons beckoning dimming, like all desires, and loss itself, to mere horizon."
Try to Remember that South African Man,"Sometimes I try to remember the name of that South African man,
who insisted on being called “Coloured,” even though in this country
he would have qualified as “black.” He was more attached to that
identification than any other, such as “older,” “dapper,” “tourist,”
“uncut,” “speaks Afrikaans,” “wears glasses.” His hair slept under my
fingers like lambswool; he could tongue longer than any guy I’ve come
across thus far. What did we talk about as we lay on the comforter
in his hotel room? Getting around Boston on foot. How we’d both
considered studying architecture. Apartheid over there, racism here,
especially how Black Americans had achieved so much in comparison,
how we seemed to take everything for granted. Back and forth.
Imagine if just bitching about inadequate schools and lack of housing
could land you at the bottom of a ditch? he asked me. But it happens
here too, I protested. He smiled: respect your elders, even if they’re
lovers. Be quiet now, and then his palm covered my mouth and nose,
leaving only a tiny slit for me to breathe. This is how they held me
before they began to beat me, he said. Then he rained down another
round of kisses."
Ten Things I Do Every Day,"after Ted Berrigan
Floss my throat
                        wash my feet then glower
kiss Curtis at 7:30
                        to shake him
feed Kitty
            philosophical tenders
stroll the valley
                        of dearth to Journal Square
keep faith like a Benedictine
                                    under the Hudson
Work like a yo-yo
                        nap like a bear
address endless emails
                        to forgotten writers
jack the meter
            to stand tall
drink lust as if
                        it were spring water
walk through the Mews
            when the coast is near
leave my friends and shadows
                        generous margins for error"
Beatitude,"Love everything
Love the sky and sea, trees and rivers,
            mountains and abysses.
Love animals, and not just because you are one.
Love your parents and your children,
            even if you have none.
Love your spouse or partner,
            no matter what either word means to you.
Love until you create a cavern in your loving,
            until it seethes like a volcano.
Love everytime.
Love your enemies.
Love the enemies of your enemies.
Love those whose very idea of love is hate.
Love the liars and the fakes.
Love the tattletales and the hypercrits, the hucksters and the traitors.
Love the thieves because everyone has thought
            of stealing something at least once.
Love the rich who live only to empty
            your purse or wallet.
Love the poverty of your empty coin purse or wallet.
Love your piss and sweat and shit.
Love your and others’ chatter and its proof of the expansiveness
            of nothingness.
Love your shadows and their silent censure.
Love your fears, yesterday’s and tomorrow’s.
Love your yesterdays and tomorrows.
Love your beginning and your end.
Love the fact that your end is another beginning,
            or could be, for someone else.
Love yourself, but not too much
            that you cannot love everything and everyone else.
Love everywhere.
Love in the absence of love.
Love the monsters breeding
            in every corner of the city and suburb,
            all throughout the soil of the countryside.
Love the monster breeding inside you and slaughter him
            with love.
Love the shipwreck of your body, your mind’s
            salted garden.
Love love."
Furry Bear,"If I were a bear,
   And a big bear too,
I shouldn’t much care
   If it froze or snew;
I shouldn’t much mind
   If it snowed or friz—
I’d be all fur-lined
   With a coat like his!
For I’d have fur boots and a brown fur wrap,
And brown fur knickers and a big fur cap.
I’d have a fur muffle-ruff to cover my jaws,
And brown fur mittens on my big brown paws.
With a big brown furry-down up to my head,
I’d sleep all the winter in a big fur bed."
Jesus in the Wilderness,"1.Temptation
I know you were weary those forty days 
in the wilderness. What was that wilderness like—
dry dust, and swirling wind, no colour, 
as the devil’s flowers do not give birth 
to seeds here? What is it to live in the forest 
of devil’s yarn, like a goat wild and yearning, 
tempted, strong of will yet weak of mind? 
What is it to want? What is temptation but yielding 
of flesh. How fast did your heart beat against 
ribcage in anger at these tantalising abominable 
lies. No one talks about limbs weakening, 
or rats gnawing your belly, lice in your hair, 
like in the belly of the ship, no one speaks 
about that. To build a saint, one needs to gloss 
over the body’s ordinariness, one needs
to forget there is mess and nastiness in the gut,
the dry throat swallowing saliva. The ache of spit
sliding along cracked lips and down your 
neck back. The way the stomach contracts, 
its punch all uneven, each like a xxx of fists.
  2. How not to drown in desire
day stretched like a bending river
day stretched and curled like a meandering river
when days began to stretch
when his days began to curl 
when his days became a meandering river
it’s undertow dragging him
when the days became deceptive, a river
meandering. It’s undertow
when his days became a meandering river
when his days began to curl into a river
when his days stretched and curled
when his days stretched, curling into a river
whose undertow dragged him weary to the surface
  3. Sufferation 
When his days stretched, curling into a river 
whose undertow ripped his skin right to the soul
he who believed, stood firm in dry dust, 
where flowers do not give birth from seeds, 
where wild goats stroll. No one talks 
of his trembling limbs, the gnawing rats 
in his gut, the fleas congregating to party
in his hair. No one talks of the reptile’s guffaw
as the Devil sucked succulent orange over forty
days and nights, while he who believed stitched 
then unpicked the stitches from his bloody lips
how the taunt of the orange juice ached 
his neck back in the ripe stench of the boat’s belly. 
How they gripe, the dry heaves scraping 
his neck back his belly swelling pregnant with emptiness. 
Since those days we fast in our thirst for salvation, 
long forgotten, the bloodied scar on his nailed palm."
Sojourner,"For the tread,
I am a farmer woman
From another field—
Hymn rise, fervid tend
For each tree. Bone
Crossing. Each.
Meal astride death
I made way
In the way light raptures
Through logs of sound. 
There, I trembled to knowledge.
And the bees glittered for me also.
I wanted a blue dress.
In the night, flies
In the lace of the trees—
A city
Where my breast culled clouds.
I peered into land
Through hollow
The wind against me."
Peridot,"after Arthur Rimbaud and Wyatt Mason
       O for a few more of those pre-trauma days, when life was as dazzling as a piece of raw peridot and all my hours were grass stains and beach glass and sycamore leaves glinting and shifting and iris spears shooting up, up, up!
       And lime cordial, molten peridot, thick and gloopy as time in the bottom of a glass—sliding, coating. And a fresh bruise when a bruise was just a bruise and could fade. And the gloaming when even the gloaming was green—pear-green and freckled sky, mustachioed wisps.
       But he is here too—fission-green flaw deep within the facet—giving off his own glow, blinding, disorientating. A crystal kind of man, polymorph, because he still has something to teach me and I don’t know if I will ever truly learn it.
       Protective stone, keeper-away of evil spirits, where were you when I needed you? His touch was mantle-hot and ruinous; intrusive, extrusive.
       I am always looking for a new frequency—hoping to recover some peridot shard of myself in this lapidary of broken things—but I can only translate what is already here and not transform. Hats off to the crystallographer who is watching chartreuse ions precipitate into livid rocks, I am toxic—petrified ectoplasm—luminously bonded to my past."
Bogeymen,"I keep running from the bogeymen on my shelf
who did bad things and wrote great poems. I try not to feel
them become erect with the word great.
I close my eyes and thumb past the award seals
that silence women I love. What a lie to be alive!
To come so close to greatness, so close it knows
your name, and survive."
If Night You Were a City,"I would return to you in a jacket of gold leaves 
drawn tight
against the city wind 
whipping around corners through button holes over
cobbled streets park lanes 
cordoned-off barbarian herds
of steel and glass and concrete ground zero for crowds 
of absence. We’d lift off beyond the brick
toward choked stars, moons outshined by neon 
and by anxious day, moons perched on dark spires
golden lions
we’d wrap our naïve wings around
to embrace the artifice of it all 
and the reality: the heat here is unbearable
and I miss the need to be warm, that need to look 
forward to nights alone with you with no morning on our minds
no time 
no need to claw through
restaurants packed with bridge and tunnel drunk 
on the filth and the beauty.
For here
there is no comparison
no autumn as autumn no snow to justify 
a hot drink or a fat meal the fish is delicious
and the beer even better but not the same. 
Some say the grass
is greener as if it’s law 
and more
that I try to recreate 
metropolis each time a baobab drops a beetle
to flee every time winter floods the sand 
to mute the night—
boats eclipsing the mainland sprawl 
trading with another language transformed before my ears:
tell me how you lived
your dream and I will tell you who you are 
every night, every single night and with a wingspan 
I resurrect in a cold sweat
and off in the distance 
there are drums
drums beating the island
like drums and outside the window an unexpected laugh
drums in concert
with the percussive horn
of the ferry to you.
There’s nothing romantic about this
nothing absolute I am reminded of
everything that went wrong everything that went right
and when I wake
if I wake, may the flash not wax
our feathers
may it not melt our wings"
One Year ago—jots what? (296),"One Year ago—jots what?
God—spell the word! I—can’t—
Was’t Grace? Not that—
Was’t Glory? That—will do—
Spell slower—Glory—
Such Anniversary shall be—
Sometimes—not often—in Eternity—

Look—feed upon each other’s faces—so—

Their Banquet’s true—
I tasted—careless—then—
I did not know the Wine
Came once a World—Did you?
Oh, had you told me so—
This Thirst would blister—easier—now—
You said it hurt you—most—
Mine—was an Acorn’s Breast—
And could not know how fondness grew
In Shaggier Vest—
Perhaps—I couldn’t—
But, had you looked in—
A Giant—eye to eye with you, had been—
No Acorn—then—
So—Twelve months ago—
We breathed—
Then dropped the Air—
Which bore it best?
Was this—the patientest—
Because it was a Child, you know—
And could not value—Air?
If to be “Elder”—mean most pain—
I’m old enough, today, I’m certain—then—
As old as thee—how soon?
One—Birthday more—or Ten?
Let me—choose!
Ah, Sir, None!"
Winter Song,"The browns, the olives, and the yellows died,
And were swept up to heaven; where they glowed
Each dawn and set of sun till Christmastide,
And when the land lay pale for them, pale-snowed,
Fell back, and down the snow-drifts flamed and flowed.
From off your face, into the winds of winter,
The sun-brown and the summer-gold are blowing;
But they shall gleam with spiritual glinter,
When paler beauty on your brows falls snowing,
And through those snows my looks shall be soft-going."
Weathering Hate,"The way, exposed to weather, a body is worn. Velvet threads begin to
wither, rapid ripened beyond the burst bloom. Vibrant strands, cut short,
fray, unweaving faded fabric. Sun-struck, rain-warped, storm-blasted,
rough-sanded in whipping wind that whittles rock. 
Small, torturous fractures opened in stone where water freezes in the
pores with grains of salt. Cracks in the surface pried apart by unrelenting
pressure. With incessant freezing and thawing, shock and fatigue speed
rugged stress to ultimate breakdown. Intemperate weather, abrading
edges, gradually disintegrates resolute minerals. 
A boulder, even a mountain, will wear down. So will bodies, bent and
broken under toilsome burdens, caving beneath unbearable weight, in
adverse climate, exposed to harsh elements, caustic rains. "
Expulsion,"                                             they are hurrying along, panting
these of the sort that for three thousand years have not imagined Isis Floating on a Stillstream, Isis in her exhaustion and despair, Isis deep in the seasons, regathering the pieces, mending, loving. Only a few years ago they spoke so often of what is still to come from “man,” “becomingly to be going to become”— 
                                                           watch this space
as if they had as yet no prescience of their doom. Behind them now are seas in tears, seas in flame. Barren ground belching gas. Rat droppings on a strawberry bedspread in a house with one wall. Not a soul in sight in any direction. No wonder they weep,
                                                 there falls some feel on them 
remembering the lethal smugness of being a corporatized subject before the punk opening of disaster, before they became wayweeds
                                                         objects before death 
with rictus smiles, viral hatreds, larvae on their tongues, phantom limbs climbing the rotten ladders of old hierarchies. They pass now, the open-carry let-freedom-hang-a-leftie swaggerers among them, rags of the Logos pulled down over their heads, having sawed through the green of the Islands of Breath,
                                        Dawn squatting to urinate on the grass
Listen, they are calling to God to save their souls, screaming for His intervention, weeping. But no ideal being of ardor order grace fairness would miss their species were it to vanish—and, for all its obscene clinging to itself, it will vanish. Like Agamemnon, these minuses—always at war and jealous of their property—“eat ruin.” Perhaps after a chastening apocalypse like this one, someone brandishing an LED torch (lol) may lead them to a spiritual disarmament. A spark, a rain cloud approaching, suspicions, theories—no, it wouldn’t last."

Porcelain Musician in a Child’s Bedroom,"Who can tell you not to mourn the dust?
      If you want to mourn the dust, 
go right ahead; or the afternoon
light sending circles to kaolin feet— 
        some music taken in, some 
              not-music taken in—or 
the dresdened-londoned-unknown-by-
   history-or-imagination maker who 
 made her & died soon after, 
        nonliving that outlives 
      the living—oops! the critic said 
    don’t use abstractions—or the six
     of carbons from the start of time
  spinning as, not in, ceramic skin, 
    the keyboard unchipped as of this
writing . . . When the music lessons 
     went less well, your mother settled
for your writing, you could say 
  settled like dust on porcelain but 
dust, the noun & verb that is 
   a thing & isn’t, drifted, its dreamy
abstract qualities sent

Habitable Nebula,"The long night reminds me that so much of what it means
      to be a person shines through obscurity, like odd condiments
bought on impulse, tested once, then pushed to the back
     of the refrigerator in their smartly labeled bottles and jars.
It’s like a birth of stars, or nights an actor plays their part
     so flawlessly, the audience gives no thought to gastroenteritis
or its various causes (viruses, bacteria, bacterial toxins,
     parasites and so forth) till hours after the last act is dust.
But setting aside all that small stuff, there’s still the entirety
     of the past, invisible or visible only in traces, as among the blur
that sets in during speeches, or when speeding to the launch
     past signage that tries to communicate but by habit we ignore.
I still can’t say what life is for, but it can’t be to pretend
     that every part of it is knowable, or that what appears to be
to the naked eye or in the middle ground or documented on paper
     approximates a person any better than a daisy does our sun.
When at a loss for what I am, I know I must be feeling it
     deep in the layers, where a turbulence gives rise to clouds
so massive they collapse in a bliss of gravity, condensing into this
      music I can daisy into morning as it daisies me into morning."
Journey of the Magi,"‘A cold coming we had of it,
Just the worst time of the year
For a journey, and such a long journey:
The ways deep and the weather sharp,
The very dead of winter.’
And the camels galled, sore-footed, refractory,
Lying down in the melting snow.
There were times we regretted
The summer palaces on slopes, the terraces,
And the silken girls bringing sherbet.
Then the camel men cursing and grumbling
And running away, and wanting their liquor and women,
And the night-fires going out, and the lack of shelters,
And the cities hostile and the towns unfriendly
And the villages dirty and charging high prices:
A hard time we had of it.
At the end we preferred to travel all night,
Sleeping in snatches,
With the voices singing in our ears, saying
That this was all folly.
Then at dawn we came down to a temperate valley,
Wet, below the snow line, smelling of vegetation;
With a running stream and a water-mill beating the darkness,
And three trees on the low sky,
And an old white horse galloped away in the meadow.
Then we came to a tavern with vine-leaves over the lintel,
Six hands at an open door dicing for pieces of silver,
And feet kicking the empty wine-skins,
But there was no information, and so we continued
And arrived at evening, not a moment too soon
Finding the place; it was (you may say) satisfactory.
All this was a long time ago, I remember,
And I would do it again, but set down
This set down
This: were we led all that way for
Birth or Death? There was a Birth, certainly,
We had evidence and no doubt. I had seen birth and death,
But had thought they were different; this Birth was
Hard and bitter agony for us, like Death, our death.
We returned to our places, these Kingdoms,
But no longer at ease here, in the old dispensation,
With an alien people clutching their gods.
I should be glad of another death."
"[A rose has thorns as well as honey,]","A rose has thorns as well as honey,
I’ll not have her for love or money;
An iris grows so straight and fine,
That she shall be no friend of mine;
Snowdrops like the snow would chill me;
Nightshade would caress and kill me;
Crocus like a spear would fright me;
Dragon’s-mouth might bark or bite me;
Convolvulus but blooms to die;
A wind-flower suggests a sigh;
Love-lies-bleeding makes me sad;
And poppy-juice would drive me mad:—
But give me holly, bold and jolly,
Honest, prickly, shining holly;
Pluck me holly leaf and berry
For the day when I make merry."
"Hail, Mary","Buon giorno, buen dia Maria
Full of grace and wisdom and power
The Lord may be with thee, and you
May be Blessed among women but
What about the children? Not the one
In the womb that has been consecrated
As the son of God, but God, your god,
My god has many sons, daughters all
Around the world. They are not all blessed
Some are cursed and lost and under a pile
Of rubble in Ukraine, Yemen, Israel, Palestine, Gaza;
Others live in the darkness of the blind, are
Plagued by hallucinations, cursed with spasms
Of a mind that plays tricks on them all day, all
Night. Imagine a predator behind you, in your
Shadow, silent, stealthy, looking over your shoulder
Or under your bed. You cannot see but you know
They are there and they mean you harm for no
Other reason than you are where you find yourself
Not for an act you perpetrated on someone else,
Just for being who you are. The luck of the draw?
And Holy Mary, Mother of God, do you pray for
The innocent as well as the sinners? The pilots,
The soldiers firing artillery rockets, are they too
Prayed for? Rockets with ranges of 30-50 miles, fired
In barrages for the most effect, the most damage.
Are they too in your prayers to god and which god
Might that be? What does that God look like, what
Does that god think, plan, why does that god never
intervene? Humans shooting hate and rockets blindly
into Ashkelon, Beersheba, under the eyes of Israeli 
drones … range is crucial for rockets, for prayers too.
Pray for us sinners and for the innocent, for my own son
Living in a world plagued with demons he cannot see
or touch or hear but knows they are there, so music
and words come to him as if a shaft of light in day
Or night, raises his voice above the din in his brain, to
Feel the lift above the iron dome of paranoia, the upsurge
Of spirits that haunt, and fly, and invade his small cot in an
Institution with cinder block walls, netted windows he can’t
See but knows they are there: the limitations, the lack
Of liberty, the outside in; the other sons and daughters
in Gaza, or Yemen or Ukraine are bombarded with a panoply
of air power used in a steadily escalating series of attacks.
What I wish for my own son is comfort, warmth, knowing
There is a meal, a roof over his head, a dog at his feet, a
Sun he can feel but not see… Mother of God, what do you
Wish for your sons, your daughters now and at the hour
Of their deaths? When will your god hear your pleas or
Have the mothers and daughters been silenced to the
Tunnels, the basements, the streets, have they lost their
Voices, their powers to heal, now and at the hour of now?"
Juan Goytisolo Dies on a Ramadan Sunday in Marrakesh,"His country was language,
His culture escritura,
In the frontiers
Of concrete imagination mask
He pursued his ‘identity.’

He went to the Cuban barrio
Of his invisible relatives,
Communion with them,
A history hidden of unlikely semblance,
Prose them into first novel.

[The will to see oneself as fragile],"The will to see oneself as 
fragile, fallible, 
liable to fail. 
To consider a stranger and 
hear, in the mind’s ear, 
one’s true voice
insisting: I must change.
Ordinary people do this
Patient urgent work
alone and together
day upon day upon day.
Like my mother, once,
leading her ailing mother 
back through the maze 
of our suburban scrawl,
past ache, past haze, 
past confusion and rage
toward a neat room
where waited prayer,
fear, forgiveness, 
grief, grace. This
is a poem about kin 
and neighbors and nations 
adrift, in error, under siege. 
This is a ceasefire poem. "
Fog,"All day the air was fog;
couldn’t see
the barbed wire, rusting
scraps, stacks
and stacks of pallets,
the tar paper roof
of Dreamer’s shack,
the underground
caverns of salt hardening
around bones.
                      The fog says,
Who will save
Detroit now?
A toothless face
in a window shakes No,
sore fingers
that want to be still
say, Not me.
Not far away from where
Youmna lies
freezing in bed,
rolling her eyes, declaring,
This is a place!
the remains of mountains
wait to be moved
through smokestacks
into air.
   "
Not Yet,"When my father breathed
unevenly, I, a child
breathed unevenly, I prayed
in Saint Maron
Maronite Catholic Church
for the world to change.
When I saw my father’s tears
I did not pray;
I hated our market
where the bullet
missed his heart,
I hoped the mists exhaled
by the Vale of Esk
in a country of lakes
four thousand miles away
would be mine.
That was before
Lopez whispered through his rotten teeth
behind a maze of welding guns,
“You’re colored, like me,”
before I knew
so much anger,
so much need
to avenge the holy cross
and the holy card
with its prayers for the dead,
so many words
I have no choice to say.
Years without enough to make me
stop talking—
I want it all.
I don’t want
the angel inside me, sword in hand,
to be silent.
Not yet."

The Economy,"for Terry Tempest Williams
I didn’t love
That I had this
Tendency
Toward melody
Or the appetite for drama
Always obvious
In my thinking
& in everything
I did. I wasn’t TV
Though I watched myself
Sometimes passively
As though brained or
Bludgeoned out of the fullness
Of my own reality. I felt
I had to respect what seduced me
Even if stupidly—even when it made
Me stupid—or meant I was—
Making of my mind a begging bowl
Laying myself waste for the devil
Making an innocent victim of the child within
So ferociously did I fear
Something adult, like sovereignty
Survival was a big-
Box-store-bought
Blanket. Not wet
But scented
With the antiseptics
Of the factory
It would take days
To air out, get it to resemble
The picture of something homey
And grandmother-made
I know what it’s like to pay
Money for such.
The three-dimensional
Image of things. To find
Them feeling hollow and smelling
Wrong. I know what it’s like.
The imitation of life.
I almost know what it means.
I disciplined my own form and the thinking
Within me. That may not be a religion
But it is grim theology.
The more muscle I had the better
I felt I could contain and conduct
The sorrow within. The smoother
Ran my blood and lymph.
My body dismayed me and I hated,
Adored it. Recurrent dreams
Of defective dolls kept coming back
To warn me. You are not a thing.
You are not the object against which forces
Tilt that you cannot control.
You are the entire subject of the world.
Tears rolled down a cheek of stone
My friend Terry writes about water
And land, mother and brother
Like a singer. I once despaired
To her that the only endangered
Species I had managed to speak
On behalf of up to that moment
Was myself. This seemed squalid
And narrow to me. Terry said it was real
Territory. I blinked melancholy
Into the seething night
Like a spotted owl in the eye
Of a security camera
Black and white bird without
Offspring or prey. My body
Is filled with plastic
I left my mother to die
To write these lines
You will parry that such is a false
Economy. But so
Are all the other ones we live by"
The Patient Ones,"I’m staring out the window, but this is not my father’s depression

Theorem of Sorts,"We admire adults for not acting like children, 
meaning we don’t have to clean up after them, 
while we spend at least half of a life trying 
to find ways to exceed the edges 
of shapes that cannot be found.

This is the likely end to a year we want
to forget or the one forgetting itself as it is coming 
to an end. Except that it isn’t, ongoingness
has its way of “keeping on keeping on,” not even 
when it all stops, since the so-called ending folds itself
into the ever-developing story, begging the question, 
is it airless, the POV? Who sees the narrator?
Is this relatable and on whose terms? 
The proposal involves switching mediums. 
I will play a faculty member at the art school 
on whose faculty I am serving, folding
myself as a fictional character into a true story.  
In the vicinity, the charm of hummingbirds, 
murder of crows, and identity taxation.

against icons. A flexible field trip to nowhere. 
When one painter speaks to another painter, I know 
that to be fully in this won’t ever be available to me either,

yet somehow we manage to communicate.

Lenoir,"My uncles are the tallest men I know.
Every doorway a chance to bow 
Their heads, they love the Lord.  
Skin so dark their last name is Lenoir.          
Imagine growing up Black 
In Louisiana with a name that French 
But only able to pass for night.  
By the time each one hits thirteen,                
He’s picked enough cotton for me 
To think of blisters when I wear 
A new shirt. At fourteen, he thinks 
Of six feet with nostalgia.  
When I was small, I’d walk 
Those fields with them in that sun.  
I’d tilt and tilt my head to find 
Their faces but end up blinded—
Too much light around 
The darkness up there. I saw 
Women see them. I’d see women 
Quake. I didn’t understand that 
My uncles were not gods. None
Of them seemed to fit in a chair. 
I mean I don’t think they ever 
Relaxed. Some men are so Black 
You can’t see them. Or you can’t 
Bear to look out of fear of not 
Measuring up. I’m only half an inch 
Over six feet. I am what this century 
Calls a man. When you think your job 
Is to look out for your baby sister,                
You show her kids how to look out 
For themselves. My baby sister has 
No kids. My uncles tell great stories.  
The Black man is always the hero. 
When one dies, we speak of him
In present tense—one gets murdered 
In Vietnam one gets shot
On Madison Avenue one elected 
City councilman a principal a deacon
A yellow school bus driver 
With bone cancer a man 
With more wives than children 
A deacon a man with more children 
Than he can remember a mason 
A deacon. I should mention 
The mean things they did.  
No grave is deep enough.  
The Black man is always the hero.  
He will walk you to the edge of a field, 
Squat close so you can hear him, 
And point, saying everything 
Your grandfather planted, everything 
His children reaped, all this is yours.
You have to grow 
Into it, your legs stretching out along 
The floor and farther beyond as you 
Fall asleep in the best chair you got."
Sheep in Winter,"The sheep get up and make their many tracks
And bear a load of snow upon their backs,
And gnaw the frozen turnip to the ground
With sharp quick bite, and then go noising round
The boy that pecks the turnips all the day
And knocks his hands to keep the cold away
And laps his legs in straw to keep them warm
And hides behind the hedges from the storm.
The sheep, as tame as dogs, go where he goes
And try to shake their fleeces from the snows,
Then leave their frozen meal and wander round
The stubble stack that stands beside the ground,
And lie all night and face the drizzling storm
And shun the hovel where they might be warm."
I look at the world,"I look at the world
From awakening eyes in a black face —
And this is what I see:
This fenced-off narrow space
Assigned to me.
I look then at the silly walls
Through dark eyes in a dark face —
And this is what I know:
That all these walls oppression builds
Will have to go!
I look at my own body
With eyes no longer blind —
And I see that my own hands can make
The world that’s in my mind.
Then let us hurry, comrades,
The road to find."
Libros de Arena,"So I open a book
A row of camels marches out,
The Sahara such infinite sand
Like the sky on land,
Where waves of dunes design motion,
Camel wants me jump upon its back,
Go riding gallop the letters of its words,
Who together compose music
Based upon an air that frames arithmetic,
Images from where they were
Prior to focus, just move through special
Terrain of pebbles in perpetuity, a date palm
Leans in the nowhere path of a lizard
Snake skin sunshine, eats a scorpion, 
Of everyday fathom air
Endure light pierce,
What dance of golden sand breasts, nothing
Seeing such oblivion, elapsed glances
Invisible book appears,
Which never occurs in a trillion years?
When a moment surprises itself and
Becomes the view light unaware,
Nothing forecast,
To close the book
Return to the silence
Of the sand heaven
Which rains from my fingers?
In the dry of motion. Sound.
So much space, 
Where is she,
Where
When? "
The Californian Book of the Dead,"I’m scared, so I’m writing this book of the dead, 
a last testament, like James Kidd, Arizona prospector
mining the edge of Superstition Wilderness, 
maybe murdered in Haunted Canyon for his gold, 
whose will left his half million to research the spirit
because “I think in time we will photograph the soul 
leaving the human at death.”  Perhaps we will, or perhaps
there’s no will left when the body, sleeplike, settles 
and the mind breaches, and the last neurons flaring in a final
visionary chain try to understand the storm wind ripping us 
from our bodies, the million tiny Buddhas crawling down 
the eyelids, white buddhas, red buddhas, blue and yellow.
The teenager daydreams super powers, walking invisible
into the girls’ locker room and bank vaults, a super punch
that sends the football jocks sprawling, but doesn’t dream
of the body’s simplest power—the power to stop.
The body has its own will, and so I leave this testament.
Crack wide the doors of the sky, let my spirit leap 
into heaven like a grasshopper, let me float among the stars 
and eat the gods, and when I stand before the lords of death 
I’ll testify that I leapt from the pit of dreams each morning 
and tried to live my life awake, that I gave twenty dollars 
to the woman by the freeway entrance with the Homeless 
and Humiliated sign while the red truck honked behind me, 
that I bowed my head and dug with my tongue 
between my lover’s legs, that I mined that cave 
and the gold for me was the pleasure she felt, but I did not 
sleep with that woman at the French bistro who was so bored 
of her husband and her little girls. I lived the best I could. 
And if the mind breaks down in death, and the last neuron
fires in darkness like a sun snuffed out in a dying galaxy,
and if I wander for a while alone and find no god,
no rat, no earthworm, no butterfly of the spirit realm,
then let this be my superpower, the ability to speak
without breath, to write without fingers, to streak like
a meteorite across a black screen, and to go on and on
without will or consciousness, just these dead words
dancing before your eyes, a toy skeleton on a string."
Parable of the Jew without a Name,"“With our despised immigrant clothing, we shed also our impossible Hebrew names.” —Mary Antin, The Promised Land  (1912)
My great-uncle Vincent, son of the Milk Street tailor, 
threw some fairy dust into the air and changed, 
making it easy for me to go to the prom, 
to grow up in Indiana and bite my tongue 
when a hick would cuss at the bastard who tried 
to Jew me down on the price for home-grown pot. 
Like wool pants for blue jeans, Moshe, Shmuel and Lazar 
traded in their names, and in exchange were changed 
from cabbage-eaters into Americans, and why not? 
“I never was a pumpkin!,” cries the carriage. 
“I never was a pauper!,” shouts the prince.
In this fairy tale all the steins turn into stones, straw turns 
to gold, stars warp into crosses, and the pauper trades up 
and leaves the trades to the star-crossed Jews. 
I’m a lousy Jew, ignorant of nearly everything 
except that in another time the Klan would lynch me, 
the Nazis flay me into yellow lampshades. 
My white hide hides me, my baseball cap keeps greasy ash 
out of my hair, and I’m glad for my nice name. 
Who needs a life so grim? In the shtetl, the old Jews 
would change their names so the Angel of Death 
flying on black crape wings above the town, 
fatal list in hand, would pass over them
—but not the ones who stayed behind 
and kept their names, the Adelsteins, Eisensteins 
or the one I’ll never know, some cousin twice removed 
born in Poland, some Maurice Bernstein. No way to gather 
smoke out of the sky and give him flesh again. 
I imagine him, with eyes like mine, intent 
and studious, staring at the rusted cattle-car wall 
in the rattling stink of packed bodies, trying not to breathe. 
He’ll get that wish soon enough. 
Slender, bookish children aren’t good workers 
and it’s too much trouble to take away their names 
and write numbers in their skin. 
They’re gassed like fleas. 
I’m a lousy Jew, but I’d like to disturb the grass, 
unearth him from the crowded grave, and let his damp fingers 
write this story, while his eyes like clouded marble roll. 
I’d like to roll the story back to the dead boy 
swaying in the train, to see him there imagining the sky 
he hasn’t seen for days, the white winter sky, like a page 
he could write on again and again, practicing his name."
The 167th Psalm of Elvis,"Blessed are the marble breasts of Venus, 
those ancient miracles, for they are upright and milk white 
and they point above the heads of the crowd in the casino.
Blessed are the crowds that play, and whose reflections 
sway in the polish of her eggshell eyes, 
for they circle like birds around the games, 
and they are beautiful and helpless.
Bless the fast glances that handle the waitress,
bless her miniskirt toga and the flame-gold scotch, 
and bless the gamblers who gaze at the stage.
Remember also the dancer and remember her dance,
her long neck arched like a wild white goose,
the tassels on her nipples that shoot like sparks,
and bless the legs and bless the breasts            
for they are fruit and honey and they are generous to the eyes.
Have mercy on my wallet, the dollars I punch into the slot,
and grace the wheels swapping clubs and hearts.
Mercy on me too, as I stumble as if in a hashish haze
watching the reels spin away, for I am a blown fuse
and I need someone to bless me before it’s too late.
Honor the chance in a million, the slot machine jolting,
the yellow light flashing, honor the voice that calls jackpot, 
and the coins that crush into the brushed steel tray,
for there is a time for winning and a time for losing
and if you cast your bread upon the waters
you will find it again after many days.
Pity the crowd around the blessed winner 
all patting his back as if it rubs off, 
this juice, this force, this whatever
that might save them from their own cursed luck.
And pity the poor winner whose hand claws back 
into his bucket of coins and who cannot walk away, 
because he’d do anything for the feeling 
he had when the great pattern rose from the chaos
of cherries and lemons and diamonds and stars
and he knew for that moment he was blessed.

The Clouds,"translated from the Spanish by Aaron Coleman
The Cloud Sanctuary.
Capacity: 84 clouds.
A new experience, because there are
clouds from sunup to sundown,
and many from different countries.
(Management forecasts more.)

Lanky-tongued like a bird,
reddish,
the daybreak clouds,
made by the farmer’s brief dreams
and hollow dawns.
Restrained,
made of dry and firm cotton,
the motherly, immovable, noonday ones.
Like serpents up in flames,
the ones that announce the Evening Star.
A curiosity: there are some from Uganda,
driven by the winds from the great Lake Victoria.
Those from el Turquino, lying low.
Those from the Maritime Alps.
Those from Pico Bolívar.
Black, with heavy breasts,
those of the storm.

Romantic clouds, too,
like, for example, those that fog up
the sky of love. The rosy-colored ones
from sixty years ago
in the Christmas cards.
Clouds with angels.
Clouds the shapes of titans,
of well-known maps (England),
of kangaroo, lion.
In brief, a respectable load.

However,
these Polar breeds, extremely rare,
there was no way to bring them back alive.
They arrived in brine, express 
from Greenland, Norway, Newfoundland.

My grandfathers did not live long enough 
to see their children grow up.
One never knew I was to exist and the other,
who really was my great-grandfather,
had me thrust upon him at the nursing home,
long enough for two photos to be taken.
His mental state so deteriorated
he could have been holding a sack of drooling yams
for all that it mattered.
And it did to those taking the photograph.
The other felled by a stroke at his butchershop,
came back grumpy, iron-fisted and older-fashioned.
He doted on us, his grandsons;
we were teens, half-formed blobs,
and he never saw who we would become, or how we would.
My father did not live long enough to see his
only grandchild grow up.
                 (He would not even know of the others
                 down the line, nor they of them.)
And at some pin-prick point in time,
this little sweetness of a child
will have no real memory of her grandfather
or later, of me.
She will wonder who her grandfather was,
not remembering how he beamed Cheshire-cat like
whenever she was around, how he carried and doted on her
like he never did with his own children,
how he lugged her kiddie table across two statelines
strapped to the roof of his car, how he drove
105 miles to get her favorite shoes specially re-soled.
She will wonder who this uncle of hers was,
not remembering that soap-bubble blowing toy monkey
from Camden Market that caused two full-scale baggage searches
at two airports, and how delighted she was
lying in front of Bubble Monkey while he did his thing.
Will she remember the swimming lessons? the games of shark-horsey?
or the bedtime stories he made up,
and how for weeks she kept searching for those stories
in all her books, insisting to her father
that the stories were there. Will she remember
the tireless hours he spent playing tea party with her?
Or will she outgrow those tea parties and ballet-dancing mice,
forsake them in favor of the mall and best friends,
lipsticks and nylons;
                and I’ll be dimmed,
worn as a Post-It note, the writing in an unfamiliar hand,
on its last sticks, barely clinging
to a basket of already broken,
dis-used and outgrown toys.
 "
Winter,"Cold, moist, young phlegmy winter now doth lie
In swaddling clouts, like new-born infancy;
Bound up with frosts, and fur’d with hail & snows,
And, like an infant, still it taller grows.
December is my first, and now the sun
To the southward Tropick his swift race doth run.
This month he’s hous’d in horned Capricorn,
From thence he ’gins to length the shortened morn,
Through Christendom with great festivity,
Now’s held (but guessed) for blest Nativity.
Cold, frozen January next comes in,
Chilling the blood, and shrinking up the skin.
In Aquarius now keeps the long-wish’d sun,
And northward his unwearied course doth run.
The day much longer than it was before,
The cold not lessened, but augmented more.
Now toes and ears, and fingers often freeze,
And travelers their noses sometimes leese.
Moist snowy February is my last,
I care not how the winter-time doth haste.
In Pisces now the golden sun doth shine,
And northward still approaches to the line.
The rivers ’gin to ope, the snows to melt,
And some warm glances from his face are felt;
Which is increased by the lengthen’d day,
Until by’s heat, he drive all cold away.
And thus the year in circle runneth round;
Where first it did begin, in th’ end its found."

Twelve,"It takes Jupiter 12 years to make a full orbit of the Sun.
The life expectancy of a game cat in captivity is 12 years. Its life
expectancy in the wild will depend on its wiliness, drought and brush fires,
the luxuriousness of its coat, the aphrodisiac qualities of its paw or penis,
and whether it is the theme ingredient on Iron Chef.
A coconut palm takes twelve years to bear fruit. When the fruit ripens, you
pluck and cut into it, and taste, you will find that you’ve spent twelve years
waiting for rats to pee in your mouth.
The feud between the Hatfields and the McCoys lasted 12 years. The 
television series based on it lasted 5 years; the biennial convention that worships each major and minor creak and crevice of that series continues till today.
It is said that Leonardo DaVinci spent 12 years painting the Mona Lisa’s lips. At the Louvre, the snaking line to see those lips will run you 12 minutes during peak hours, less than three during off-peak. In front of the portrait, you will hear in any variety of languages, “Is that it?”
A wingless bug in Fremont, California, power-walking at a centimeter per minute, would take 12 years to get to San Francisco’s Union Square, assuming it doesn’t get squished on the Bay Bridge. If the bug crawls onto public transit, and it will need a transfer, the journey time is shortened considerably.
Twelve dog years roughly equals 61 human years; twelve cat years, though, are 64. Who has the more stressful life?

In the course of an ordinary lifetime, the human heart—even with palpitations, no matter how many horror movies you see, cheap shocks foisted upon you, no matter how many zero-gravity rollercoaster g-force-plunging thrill rides, marathons and triathlons, mountains climbed, no matter how much methamphetamine, step-aerobics, heartbreak or heart-attack you take on—stands still for, give or take a little, 12 years.
Put your hand on your heart. Every thump you feel is counting down, one more down, to its beat, that last squeeze."
Gutted,"My favorite children’s bedtime prayer
is the one that goes:
                 Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John,
                 The bed be blest that I lie upon,
                 Four angels to my bed,
                 Four angels around my head,
                 One to watch and one to pray,
                 And two to bear my soul away.
This is such a vast improvement
over the more popular,
                 Now I lay me down to sleep,
                 I pray the Lord my soul to keep.
                 If I should die before I wake,
                 I pray the Lord my soul to take.
The difference is that
in one, you get to go
to bed with four men.
But in both, the child is afraid
he will die in the middle
of the night in his sleep.
                                               (Why? What’s going on in these homes?
                     Where’s Child Protective Services when they’re needed?)
Later, the child will grow up
and realize the lie hidden 
in those prefabricated prayers.
That is what most people want:
to die in your sleep,
to die in your own bed."

Solstice in Truro,"Teaching term done, I keep my laptop shut
A chill in the air runs under weak June sun
Chickadee warbler catbird waxwing—
Morning migrant songs drowned by bulldozer next door
The backing up beeping a constant one note feed
From far off, boundless tides crest onto restless sand
How my grandfather made his way, a refugee from Kyiv
How the new war gathers and opens his voice in me"
Family Secret,"Too many cracks precede 
the spectacular breaking. Each 
story begins in a different dark-
ness. And light: think how it catches
on any surface (pane or 
hinge or keyhole) and 
out of night (out of nothing), 
all at once: a window, 
a door. It’s a metaphor 
(and then it isn’t), darkness. 
When I dream again
it’s the old kitchen—I 
open the oven and sound, 
like ropes of heat, drifts 
out; a shimmering. Familiar 
and confusing. Uncanny,
and then unmistakable: our 
voices, recorded. Playback 
and loop, now—every aching 
word we whispered here."
Ode to Goby,"Here, floating with the water
I escape. I float. I immerse in the richness 
of the forest; fade into the dark greens
of the ferns and reeds of the shore,
the light greens of the new leaves on the trees,
the water rushing, and oh the bird calls too.
Came to sedate, cleanse, escape.
Came to clear out my dreams
filled with bears that each night enter 
my room, tearing it apart
so as to let me know there aren’t enough
fish this year and likely the next too.
Came for water so clear 
that I could wash, that I could see. 
Came to see a goby, 
a blue, a purple, a turquoise 
too when seen from the side,
then a clear that is as a pink when it turns. 
Even as it is getting dark so fast 
that there is almost nothing left to see 
still, we together swim on, into some world
not yet imagined, not yet understood.
Oh goby, I am sorry we have made things 
so impossible for you, for all of us.
Sorry that we have done so much that 
you are few; sorry to be so lost, imageless, 
confused; sorry that I do not know how to be 
other than Grendel, swamp-like, dwelling in fen 
and moorland, up to his knees in the water
wandering the outskirts of town, angry, 
unforgiving of those who still find happiness 
amidst loss. Goby, even the very things 
that would cure us we put at risk: 
the tall tapering racemes of white midsummer
flowers on wiry black-purple stems 
that is the black cohosh; the blood red sap 
of the bloodroot and its small white petals that 
open up in sunlight; the hairy deep purple
stems of the goldenseal that support two hand-shaped leaves.
This world that once was so much, now less.
This world that was once a luminous archive 
of things evolved and adapted in slow moving 
specificity. This world that Césaire wrote 
when there was the possibility
that it might turn some other way than the nation, 
a world not of enclosure but of predatory 
celebration, liberation, a world of the sparrowhawk, 
the cynocephalus, the dolphins, and the wolves 
who feed in the untamed openings.
Fled is that music, that world, that rhetorical question 
and yet we continue on, angry, unforgiving, unsure."
The Crying of Water,"O water, voice of my heart, crying in the sand,
All night long crying with a mournful cry,
As I lie and listen, and cannot understand
The voice of my heart in my side or the voice of the sea,
O water, crying for rest, is it I, is it I?
All night long the water is crying to me.
Unresting water, there shall never be rest
Till the last moon droop and the last tide fail,
And the fire of the end begin to burn in the west;
And the heart shall be weary and wonder and cry like the sea,
All life long crying without avail,
As the water all night long is crying to me."
At the Retirement Home,"U.S. Soldier, 194th Armored Regiment, retired, Brainerd, Minnesota
I’ve had both knees replaced. I’ve got a steel
pin in my hip. I don’t hear you so good,
but I’m not stupid, son. How would you feel,
surviving the Bataan Death March, no food
for days, no water, and the ones who fell
behind were bayoneted where they lay,
and now you’re marching off to death? Real hell
is not old age, though. No, taking away
the rights we died for, saying torture’s right,
that’s hell. Hand me the iron and those shirts,
would you? Thanks, son. As long as I have fight
in me I’ll love this country till it hurts.
And it does. This is worse than what I saw
overseas. Torture. In America.

Home Brew,"Woman, Evansville, Indiana
He never drank a lick before the war
but he came back a fall-down drunk. He said
they’d cook up home brew from potatoes or
from fruit and then get bombed among the dead.
He started slapping me around, and changed 
to someone moaning to himself at night,
oh God, oh Mom, a silent man, deranged
inside, his spirit bottled up. One night
last year I woke up with his hands around 
my throat. His mouth was moving. He was dreaming.
I thumbed him in the eyes till he came round
and when he understood he broke down weeping.
He put his medals in a box. It’s done,
he said, and got a drink. It wasn’t done.

The Crew,"U.S. Marine, Iwo Jima, 1945
 Mac was a good ‘ol boy from Tennessee,
the Sergeant was a South Bronx loan shark,
Slow Jack’s a farm boy from New Harmony,
and I was green, still frightened of the dark.
That was our crew. At least, the ones not dead.
Slow Jack kept gold teeth tied up in a sock. 
The Sergeant had his legs cut off by Doc
and begged me would I shoot him in the head.
I couldn’t do it for him, and his screams
went on all night. Later, I lost this arm.
I still wake up with night sweats and night fears
and see the girl I killed inside my dreams.
Slow Jack is back and working on the farm.
Mac has a necklace made of human ears."
The Cave,"U.S. Marine, Iwo Jima, 1945
I was the torch man, and I liked it, strange
as that is to admit. It was the worst
thing in the world. I’d sneak up into range
and throw a flame in, just a burst. A burst
is all it takes. It sucks the oxygen
and then they burn alive or suffocate.
My mouth still tastes that taste, burnt flesh. Back then,
I felt nothing. I did my job. No hate,
no nothing. The men liked me, called me Hot Shot.
But it meant nothing when the Nips would rush
out, clothes on fire and smoking, and we’d shoot
them dead. It meant we lived. Nothing to gush
about. I don’t have anything to hide.
Nothing. I shoved it all down deep inside. "
Grace under Pressure,"U.S. Marine, Iwo Jima, 1945
When the potato masher hand grenade
flew in the hollow, Mark, the quiet boy,
looked at me with such sorrow. Then he lay
down on the thing. He knew his death would buy
our lives, and so he spent it all, just tossed
his future in the pot like a big spender
in Vegas. Damn him, who can pay that loss
off? I can’t. “Neither borrower nor lender”
was what my pop taught me. For what he gave
with rag doll arms spread wide when the bomb blew
him off the earth, I kissed his dirty face,
closed his dead eyes. I knew I had to live
my life a cleaner way, the way he flew
into the sky (before he fell). With grace.

"Beach Landing, Iwo Jima","U.S. Marine, Iwo Jima, 1945
They didn’t shoot at us. A silent scene
until we clogged the beach, and then—all hell,
potato masher hand grenades, machine 
gun fire, artillery. I swear each shell
passed close enough you could reach up and catch
it like a ball. I crawled across black sand,
and used each corpse for cover. Don’t attach
yourself, is what I learned. Push it down and
crawl in a hole. Go numb, and you’ll survive,
maybe, as I survived. I didn’t hate
the man who charged me with his bayonet.
I crouched and shot him dead so I could live.
But the photo in his helmet cut my heart.
A child, smiling at me. And then I wept.
 "
Hospital Tent,"U.S. Navy Nurse, the Philippines, 1942
I looked around the scene, and saw the men,
some dead, some twisting on the tables, smell
of antiseptic, smell of blood, and then
I looked outside where more waited. I tell
you I knew nothing of the Philippines,
of mangoes, houses on stilts, nipa huts, 
the smell of copra in the air, gangrene
and amputations, lice, the surgeon’s cuts
I had to sew back up, of carabao,
the glisten of the small steel instruments
catching the glint of lantern light, red pile
of gauze. But still I never cried
until one day when (I did not see how)
my hand was grabbed as I passed by, intent,
by a young man who gave me half a smile
and held me with his hands and eyes—then died.
 "
The Empty Apartment,"Sometimes I think that people are the fingers
of God, like the blind ocean touching land,
and life’s a Braille that I won’t understand
if I’m not touching you and we’re not singers
kissing a song out of our mouths in bed.
Tonight I fumble keys in darkness by
my door and try to feel my way inside
to cook alone and watch TV; instead
I walk down California to the seething
blackness out there beyond the glowing beach
and stand a long time listening to each
heave, the ocean like the planet breathing.
It’s done with raging windily and wild.
Tonight it whispers, Shush, it whispers, Child.
 "
Belly,"The mirror shows me how my end begins:
expectant paunch ballooning out the skin,
my stomach pushes out the cotton shirt.
Or else my death was born onto the earth
with me and is this shadow I see gaze
out of the mirror’s labyrinth, and fear
is facing my own face that disappears
like shower steam’s evaporating glaze.
Or else I am my death, bloated fat cells
within me are time bombs and the last tick
detonates the body politic.
Or else it’s something more than I can tell:
thing in the mirror, a stillbirth, unsexed,
pushing the belly out. And what comes next?

Many Horses,"The day you arrived on your Turquoise Horse I was already riding my Rainbow Horse, as we were promised beautiful horses to carry us into this world.  On this Rain-blessed earth you will pause at Ch’ooshgai to sing:

I recognize you by your sweet song and your horse. We urge our horses on.  Tracks imbedded in the sand."

The Dark Cavalier,"I am the Dark Cavalier; I am the Last Lover:
My arms shall welcome you when other arms are tired;
I stand to wait for you, patient in the darkness,
Offering forgetfulness of all that you desired.
I ask no merriment, no pretense of gladness,
I can love heavy lids and lips without their rose;
Though you are sorrowful you will not weary me;
I will not go from you when all the tired world goes.
I am the Dark Cavalier; I am the Last Lover;
I promise faithfulness no other lips may keep;
Safe in my bridal place, comforted by darkness,
You shall lie happily, smiling in your sleep."
Moth Madness,"Moths circle the kerosene lamp
     on the floor that
     sheds a dim light on our night work.
     My cousin and I keep carding the wooly clumps.
     Twigs and dirt that clung to the sheep
     from their wanderings among sagebrush and thistle
     drop into our laps.
     We card and card to transform them
     into layers of soft clouds for Nalí’s spindle.
Iich’ąhii says Nalí, almost in a whisper,
     like she was afraid to stir the name,
     like the name might release something formed from night.
Iich’ąhii, the word flutters
     in the shadows and cautions
     against all that is unbalanced in the Glittering World,
     the reckless, the violators, the amoral,
     evil floating all around
     that must be righted with songs and prayers.
Baa’hádzid! She exclaims, no longer whispering.
     Harsh caution against a suicidal jump into the fire.
     I would learn what it means to yearn
     for the fire burning in a stranger, the coup de foudre,
     that matched my own moth madness.
Nalí’s spindle tilts, like the earth’s axis,
     she places against her thigh
     spins intensely,
     as she transforms clouds of wool
     into layers upon layers of streaks
     for her canvas that becomes her world.
     She calls the earth and sky;
     She calls stories of female mountains;
     She calls stories of male mountains;
     She calls geometric designs to her
     to balance the world against
     the moth madness.
  Nalí–paternal grandmother
Iich’ąhii–moth insect
Baa’hádzid–used to denote something fearful"
Refugees in Our Own Land,"The night is busy with the growth of stars.  Above us peaceful.  Shiyáázh, my son, fusses in his cradleboard.  The protective rainbow shaped by his father arches over his face to protect him.  In the dark sand below Monster Slayer’s archenemy rises again to pull us off this rock where we’ve taken refuge since winter’s approach.
The wind stops.  Clouds drift across the moon.  We pull water silently from below near the soldier’s feet.  Silence is our cover.  I pull my son close and place my hand on my baby’s cheek to quiet him.  “Shhh, shee’awéé’, shiyázhí, shhh.”  Hush, baby, my beloved, hush.  With my finger I circle the pulse just above his ear.  He makes tiny lapping sounds with his mouth and turns toward my breast for the comfort of my milk.  But my breast is a sieve from which the enemy drinks.  I am dry.
These hands that mixed bread dough for the evening meal, that planted corn and gathered pollen from the tender shoots.  These hands held my husband’s kisses and caressed my baby’s soft bones as he grew inside me.  We sailed the river that led us to the ocean of all beginnings.  The night cries like an owl.  My beloved son’s eyes are full of stars.  A drowning breath in his throat.  Take this map of rainbows and fly, fly, child."

Hanging,"We never let it mean by the throat,
nor even these days by a thread.
Nor tendons that gripped 
as conquistador’s blade 
severed down, to unload
that cargo unnamed, 
disremembered, off 
a West Indian coast—no:
concede only a pertinence
to chandeliers overhead,  
decorations tastefully framed,
my young niece, upside down
from careful arms, or a chair: 
along with odd ornaments
we allow that past tense
that rhymes with tongue, a tense de-
fanged, death’s proximity limited 
to the headboard crucifix 
under which mother’s mother 
is quietly passing, among off-
season carolings, tokens 
of her family’s small well-to-do;
that one high shelf, where 
mementos will go. Let all 
other echoes let go, losing
traction on each slant 
of décor and rhyme, every
struck chime unanswering 
as the tongue of that Savior. 
Skedaddle, black widow:  
still restless, deprived. 
To our kitchen run
children, how unmindfully 
alive. Reckless as flies
past these indefinitely
tensed lines, hungry."
The Land of Nod,"The night after she returned from the hospital 
the uneven rumbly liquid breathing of one soon  
to go under kept me at the surface of thoughts 
I couldn’t escape. Clonazepam, Lorazepam, 
not even Ambien could pull or sink me. And in the morning, 
sure enough, we couldn’t coax or shake her awake  
except for a few seconds when someone or thing  
wrenched her eyes open and let her answer no 
to every question in a scornful voice we’d never heard before 
before pulling her down to that rocky undertow. 
Through the morning and afternoon every breath, 
a grunt, a rattling that soaked the bedclothes and pillows in sweat. 
Then at 3 pm, she returned—recognizing her two daughters 
speaking her own name and the name of the president. 
The hospice nurse put a line through the word “Comatose” 
scrawled at the top of her chart and for the next few hours 
a light or absence seemed to emanate from her almost 
emptied irises. No sentences. No speech as the white  
nimbus of hair, thick and lively around her head 
nodded yes to sitting up and getting dressed— 
to sweet potatoes and Jeopardy! as though part of her  
remained in that rheumy underwater place 
that took her breath away and wiped out the syntax  
of explanation and inquiry, leaving only 
no I won’t and certainly not and don’t ever wake me up again. "

So locks, so chute of knots & pliant waves hang fluently.
Boldness trails along the floor, lies under folds alluringly.

Lips unlock, loose hiccups, purse & soak superdeliciously.

Charms to hold a faithful heart in chains surface sparingly.
Mouth pearls apart to nurse the damned & broken liquidly.
Gazes nail the coarsened killer’s heart non-metaphorically.
New moons from hollows rise & hold anti-gravitationally.
Tears enough to stuff a cloud complain meteorologically.
Skin & bone, dear as my blood, a girl gave to me readily

Stop. Let me ask where they turned, for I went maplessly
Through wastes, my camel chafing at roads unrelentingly
Bare, her frame concave, hump gone, my haste hungrily
Sapping her speed all the way to Hajir. There, malelessly,
Camels shadowed a dire moon. I folded my ribs uneasily
About it even as, all bared, it circled me, & I specularly
It. I looked for the traces it wiped as it went, fruitlessly."

so we went and got burgers at a place
that sold no liquor. The burgers
were okay. But we shared our shakes

ourselves renegades in that room.

tips of their muted spray; but coming out
again in the afternoon the wait had been, I saw,
for their moment in the day, to open asters,
perfect sunny fives haphazard in the air,
map pins on a dream-warm itinerary
and every outpost a starry capital.

Corliss Engine,"The hours, in a long plunge,
Swirl unconquering
Against this motion clear in steel.
Body of an older birth, like rock
That stands against a sea, this motion breaks
Time’s lesser flow. And here is raised
A symbol of the flight in emptiness
That bears the world and our own selves;
Before such clarity the days fall back; the very days
That drown our lives at last, fall spent
Before the deeper might that builds our blood."
Bondage Device: Cross,"Gelatin silver print, Hal Fischer, 1977
I swear, this filthy light could pass clean
            through me. My body—stretched & strung
across a wooden cross. Counterfeit
            Christ, corset abandoned in the corner.
There’s a precision to the intimacy
            of this ritual; strangers’ vicarious
hunger for gentle violence; being made
            a spectacle in a room filled up with spectacle.
It takes a measure of restraint. A precise
            velocity & angle to make wood or leather
into thunder. Snap & paint a red horizon
            on my spine, my ass, my chest, or thighs.
Mark skin the tint of stolen pomegranates
            split against cement, then faded to the shade
of winter figs. A broken still life—landscape
            layered over landscape. The gathered bodies:
Dom & sub, whip & cross & crowd, create
            a lexicon of their desires. Even the image
desires something—witness. When asked
            why he took the pictures of bondage gear
without a body in the frame, Fischer said:
            because it would have been too real.
Would have pushed too hard against
            an invisible boundary. Even the empty
frame demands something—a body
            to fill it. I fill it with a memory. My body
of hazy lines & thin glass longing
            to shatter."
In an Operating Room Outside of the Cis Woman’s Imagination,"In response to Sharon Olds’ poem “Outside the Operating Room of the Sex-Change Doctor”
            In an operating room outside of the cis woman’s imagination,
no tray of organs—severed.
            No blood for her to leaden with a massacre’s name.
After anesthesia, nothing is removed. Nothing wasted. Instead, skin
budded inward, a rose blooming into its own mouth.
            While the patient is still sedated, the doctor scalpels genesis,
sutures her body toward the truth.
            There is no organ severed & named a weapon for the convenience
of a body’s disposal.
            No organ severed & speaking at all. Made a puppet in the lazy
pantomime of metaphor.
            If anything is cut away, let it be the word his from the tip
of the cis woman’s tongue. Let it be her tongue.
            If anything speaks, let it be the new & perfect organ, who says
I was a Georgia O’Keefe painting dressed in drag & now, darlings
see how I bloom, how my petals slowdance the breeze.
            The cis woman’s severed tongue says nothing—least of all
to name trans women animals.
            The poem is about imagination? Right? I want to tell you
that I believe the tongue would whisper I’m sorry, I’m sorry.
            I’m not willing to lie."

the wedding band—a night-thin bruise of gold
a promise we know we can’t keep making.

brides of each other nightly & divorcing in the sun.

Bushwick Bohemia,"Para mi gente...
chequealo...
Bushwick on my mind
quinceañeras at the bodega
with their pretty pink dresses
luscious dark eyes
longing to cut the Valencia cakes
while Mr. Softee lingers
over coco helados y piragüeros
fighting for the last dollar
Across the street,
santeros dressed in white
with their collares
buying chickens at the poultry shop
for their next tambor
to be held this Sunday
in someone else’s crowded basement
Maggie cruisin’ back and forth
back and forth
keeping the dealers in check
as the sounds of beepers
Rottweiler fights
Freestyle
& chanting from the Pentecostal church
fill the air with the smells
of pernil, alcapurrias y empanadas
from La Claribel—
the best cuchifrito in town
Up on the roof,
Miguelito giving blowjobs
to gray-haired old men
so that he can get a fade
at Paul’s boutique
or buy mami that fake painting
she wanted for $5.99
down Knickerbocker Avenue
Malitza walking by
pregnant with her second baby
only 18 & already night manager at McDonald’s
She wasn’t gonna end up consumed
in the empty little crack bags
she counted
every morning
on her way to Grover Cleveland High School
Hector, her boyfriend,
home from playing handball all day
lying shirtless on the couch blunted out of his mind
staring at the roach on the ceiling
one single roach in a vast desert
or maybe an alien exploring a new world
the ceiling fan—
his spaceship
Doña Carmen sneezing so loud
the walls so thin
Hector says ‘Salud’
& she hears him from the second floor
over Walter Mercado
on Canal 41
Turning off the kitchen lights
so that the roaches can scurry into the darkness—
their freedom
like the children playing out all night
Waiting for the L train
‘Mira, Georgie...
Gimme a quarter!’
‘Fine...
but cha betta pay me back tomorrow!’
Life in Bushwick,
Ain’t it a trip!
One day we’ll all be buried
beneath the ground we spit on

trying to figure out what makes me an American
I see Ecuador and Puerto Rico
I see brujo spirits moving 
across the backs of Santeros
splattered with the red blood of sacrificed chickens
on their virgin white clothes 
and blue beads for Yemaya
practicing religions without a roof
I see my own blood
reddening the white sheets of a stranger
proud American blue jean labels 
on the side of the bed
I see Don Rosario in his guayabera
sitting outside the bodega
with his Puerto Rican flag
reading time in the eyes of alley cats
I see my mother trying to be 
more like Marilyn Monroe
than Julia De Burgos
I see myself trying to be more like James Dean
I see Carlos Santana, Gloria Estefan,
Ricky Martin and Jennifer Lopez
More than just sporadic Latin explosions
More like fireworks on el Cuatro de Julio
as American as Bruce Springsteen, Janis Joplin,
Elvis Presley and Aretha Franklin
I see Taco Bells and chicken fajitas at McDonald’s
I see red, orange, yellow, green, blue and purple
I see Chita Rivera on Broadway
You see, I am as American as lemon meringue pie
as American as Wonder Woman’s panties
as American as Madonna’s bra
as American as the Quinteñeros, 
the Abduls, the Lees,
the Jacksons, the Kennedys
(Mostly) all of us immigrants to this soil
since none sound American Indian to me
as American as television snow 
after the anthem is played
and I am not ashamed
Jose, can you see...
I pledge allegiance
to this country ’tis of me
land of dreams and opportunity
land of proud detergent names and commercialism
land of corporations
If I can win gold medals at the Olympics
If I can sign my life away 
to die for the United States
Ain’t no small-town hick 
gonna tell me I ain’t an American
because I can spic in two languages

Legendary,"There are Gods amongst us in these ghettos
so black, so fierce, 
so brown, so beautiful, 
Their time on earth 
may be as oppressive as ignorance
limited to the demons flowing in their blood
but after safely passing over back to the clouds
the wind will still carry their auras and prophecies
their bones will still beat drums 
for their children to dance
the phoenix will still rise from the flames of Paris with hope in womb
There are Gods amongst us in these ghettos
so brown, so fierce, 
so black, so beautiful, 
That if you spend too much time 
caught up in yourself
You just might miss Him that is goddess, 
she that is god, 
they that are legends
Working the runway as if walking on water 
Reaching the stage to that promised land
where ‘peace’ is not ridiculed and the only war worth fighting for
is protecting your child from the terrorist acts of a mainstream America
where ‘reading’ is an act of learning 
not degrading words used to disguise 
fragility and fractured dreams
where ‘shade’ is a shadow you walk in 
to avoid the light
but who wants to stay 
out of the warmth of the sun? 
If you waste your time 
trying to be a false prophet 
robed in attitude and labels 
to obscure the insecurity
you may fail to recognize 
their divinity and miracles
parting the crowds, resurrecting from the floor, 
scoring tens of commandments, 
because trophies will not feed the hungry, 
coat the homeless, 
hide the scars, 
Grand Prizes will not bring Lazarus or LaBeija back from the dead
they will just sit in your closet, 
fake idols gathering dust, 
before the gold paint chips away
You cannot sell them for freedom
You cannot trade them in for love
There are Gods amongst us in these ghettos
so black, so fierce, 
so black, so beautiful, 
so brown, so fierce, 
so brown, so beautiful, 
Watch them carefully and say your prayers 
as they enter the ballroom
angel wing feathers decorating skin 
recrafted over silicone 
and martyred colors
See the Gods dream, see the Gods give, 
see the Gods live, 
They exist in the spaces where white 
is not the only hue 
that represents purity
They will not battle to your rhythms and beats
click, spin and dip simply for amusement
They will not teach those who share their souls and names to hate
Their heartbeats are louder 
than the blaring speakers 
You want realness... look at your hands
are they red from the revolution or from the blood of your own sisters
There are Gods amongst us in these ghettos
so black, so brown, so fierce, 
so beautiful, so bright
Look up towards the heavens and pray
then look at yourself in the mirror and say
‘Stars are not only found out in the sky 
but in ourselves’

Step Father,"He forgets that he used to call me mariconcito-
that I harbored years of hatred toward him
while hoping to find my real father. My
childhood memories of him reminding me
I was my mother’s son, not his. I tried
to poison him once and scattered sharp nails
inside the shoes in his closet. By the time one
of his sons died of AIDS I was already lost
in contempt for the man I blamed for everything.
There was the time I was in love and he met my 
boyfriends. Now he forgets to go to the bathroom
or where he is. I help him walk slowly
outdoors to step outside the prison cell that is
the tiny apartment with no windows in which
I grew up abused by both of them. He barely
understands. His fate has been torture. I know
that I cannot be his savior. I used to pray for
him to die but here he is slowly fading. In his
eyes I see that he learned to love me and wishes
he could take it all back. He is unable to recall
those drunken nights and hateful words. I should
do the same. I left a long time ago but he still
remains haunted by the little boy who wanted
to belong. Like him, I want to forget that we
made mistakes and caused so much pain. I need
for both of us to remember how he taught me
how to ride a bike and how to swim and told
me, better late than never, that he loved me and
was proud of all I had done. I have to help him
settle into his favorite chair and let him know that
I forgive him. There is a place somewhere where
he will call me hijo and I will know him as my dad.
    Paso Padre
Se olvida que me llamaba mariconcito— 
que albergué años de odio hacia él
mientras esperaba encontrar a mi verdadero padre. 
Memorias de la infancia, 
él recordándome que era hijo de mi madre, no de él. 
Una vez intenté envenarlo y puse uñas afiladas 
dentro de los zapatos en su armario. 
Cuando uno de sus hijos murió de sida yo ya estaba perdido 
en el desprecio por el hombre al que culpé de todo.
Hubo un tiempo en que estuve enamorado y conoció a mis novios. 
Ahora se olvida de ir al baño o donde está. 
Le ayudo a salir afuera, a caminar despacio, 
a que salga de la prisión que es el pequeño apartamento 
sin ventanas dónde crecí abusado por los ambos.  
El apenas entiende. Su destino ha sido una tortura. 
Sé          que no puedo ser su salvador. 
Solía orar para que muriera, 
pero aquí se está desvaneciendo lentamente. 
En sus ojos veo que aprendió a quererme 
y que desea poder recuperarlo todo.  
Es incapaz de recordar esas noches de borrachera 
y palabras llenas de odio.
Yo debería hacer lo mismo. 
Me fui hace mucho tiempo, 
pero todavía  lo atormenta el niño que quería pertenecer.
Como él, quiero olvidar que cometimos errores
causamos tanto dolor. 
Necesito que ambos recordemos 
como me enseñó a andar en bicicleta 
y cómo nadar y me dijo mejor tarde que nunca que me amaba 
y que estaba orgulloso de todo lo que yo había hecho. 
Tengo que acomodarlo en su silla favorita 
y dejarle saber que lo perdono. 
Hay un lugar donde me llamará hijo 
y lo conoceré como mi papá.

"summer, somewhere","somewhere, a sun. below, boys brown
as rye play the dozens & ball, jump 
in the air & stay there. boys become new 
moons, gum-dark on all sides, beg bruise
-blue water to fly, at least tide, at least 
spit back a father or two. i won’t get started.
history is what it is. it knows what it did.
bad dog. bad blood. bad day to be a boy
color of a July well spent. but here, not earth
not heaven, we can’t recall our white shirts
turned ruby gowns. here, there’s no language 
for officer or law, no color to call white.
if snow fell, it’d fall black. please, don’t call 
us dead, call us alive someplace better.
we say our own names when we pray.
we go out for sweets & come back. 
           //
this is how we are born: come morning
after we cypher/feast/hoop, we dig
a new one from the ground, take
him out his treebox, shake worms
from his braids. sometimes they’ll sing
a trapgod hymn (what a first breath!)  
sometimes it’s they eyes who lead
scanning for bonefleshed men in blue.
we say congrats, you’re a boy again! 
we give him a durag, a bowl, a second chance.
we send him off to wander for a day
or ever, let him pick his new name.
that boy was Trayvon, now called RainKing.
that man Sean named himself i do, i do.
O, the imagination of a new reborn boy
but most of us settle on alive. 
           //
sometimes a boy is born
right out the sky, dropped from
a bridge between starshine & clay.
one boy showed up pulled behind
a truck, a parade for himself
& his wet red train. years ago
we plucked brothers from branches
unpeeled their naps from bark.
sometimes a boy walks into his room
then walks out into his new world
still clutching wicked metals. some boys
waded here through their own blood. 
does it matter how he got here if we’re all here
to dance? grab a boy, spin him around.
if he asks for a kiss, kiss him.
if he asks where he is, say gone. 
           //
dear air where you used to be, dear empty Chucks 
by front door, dear whatever you are now, dear son,
they buried you all business, no ceremony. 
cameras, t-shirts, essays, protest 
then you were just dead. some nights
i want to dig you up, bury you right.
scrape dirt until my hands are raw 
& wounds pack themselves with mud. 
i want to dig you up, let it rain twice 
before our next good-bye.
 dear sprinkler dancer, i can’t tell if I’m crying 
or i’m the sky, but praise your sweet rot 
unstitching under soil, praise dandelions
 draining water from your greening, precious flesh. 
i’ll plant a garden on top
 of where your hurt stopped. 
//       
mama, 
 just this morning the sun laid a yellow not-palm
on my face & i woke knowing your hands 
were once the only place in the world. 
this very morning i woke up 
& remembered unparticular Tuesdays, 
my head in your lap, scalp covered in grease 
& your hands, your hands, those hands
my binary gods. Those milk hands, bread hands, 
hands in the air in church hands, cut-up fish hands,
for my own good hands, back talk backhands, hurt more 
than me hands, ain’t asking no mo’ hands
everything i need come from those hands, 
tired & still grabbing grease, hum
while she makes her son royal onyx hands. 
mama, how far am i 
gone from home?
            //
no need for geography
now, we safe everywhere.
point to whatever you please
& call it church, home, or sweet love.
paradise is a world where everything
is sanctuary & nothing is a gun.  
here, if it grows it knows its place
in history. yesterday, a poplar 
told me of old forest
heavy with fruits i’d call uncle
bursting red pulp & set afire, 
harvest of dark wind chimes. 
after i fell from its limb
it kissed sap into my wound.
do you know what it’s like to live
on land who loves you back?
            //
i loved a boy once & once he made me
a red dirge, skin casket, no burial.
left me to become a hum in a choir 
of bug mouths. he was my pastor 
in violet velvet, my night nurse
my tumor, my sick heart, my bad blood
all over his Tims. he needed me 
so much he had to end me. 
i was his fag sucked into ash, 
his lungs my final resting place. 
my baby turned me to smoke
choked on my name ‘til it was gone. 
i was his secret until i wasn’t,
alive until not. outside our closet
i found a garden. he would love it 
here. he could love me here.
           //
dear brother from another
time, today some stars gave in
to the black around them
& i knew it was you.
my ace, my g, my fellow
kingdomless king
they’ve made you a boy
 i don’t know
replaced my friend
with a hashtag.
 wish i could tell you
 his hands are draped
from my neck, but his
shield is shaped like
a badge. i leave revenge
hopelessly to God. 
            //       
brother, 
last night’s dream was a red June
filled with our mouths sticky
with sugar, we tiny teethed brown beasts
of corner stores, fingers always
dusted chetto gold. do you remember
those yellow months? our calves burned
all day biking each other around on pegs
taking turns being steed & warrior
at the park we stormed like distant shores
our little ashy wars, shoes lit with blue sparks
those summers we chased anybody
who would say our names, jumped fences
just to prove we could jump, fingers stained
piff green with stank, riding around
barely old enough to ride around, dreaming
a world to conquer? i wish you ended me, Sweet Cain.
            //
if we dream the old world 
we wake up hands up
sometimes we unfuneral a boy 
who shot another boy to here
& who was once a reaper we make 
a brother, a crush, a husband, a duet
of sweet remission. say the word
i can make any black boy a savior
make him a flock of ravens
his body burst into ebon seraphs. 
this, our hand-crafted religion. 
we are small gods of redemption. 
we dance until guilt turns to sweat. 
we sweat until we flood & drown.
don't fret, we don’t die. they can't kill 
the boy on your shirt again.
           //
the forest is a flock of boys
who never got to grow up
blooming into forever
afros like maple crowns 
reaching sap-slow toward sky. watch
Forest run in the rain, branches
melting into paper-soft curls, duck
under the mountain for shelter. watch
the mountain reveal itself a boy. 
watch Mountain & Forest playing
in the rain, watch the rain melt everything
into a boy with brown eyes & wet naps—
the lake turns into a boy in the rain
the swamp—a boy in the rain
the fields of lavender—brothers
dancing between the storm. 
            //
my stolen lover,
when i want to kiss you
 i kiss the ground.
i shout down sirens.
they bring no safety.
my king turned my ache
my one turned into my nothing.
all last month was spent in bed
with your long gone name.
what good is a name 
if no one answers back?
i know when the wind feels
as if it’s made of hands
& i feel like i’m made of water
it’s you trying to save me
from drowning in myself, but i can’t 
wed wind. I’m not water. 
            //       
dear dear
my most distant love—
when i dream of you i wake
in a field so blue i drown.
if you were here, we could play
Eden all day, but fruit here 
grows strange, i know before me
here lived something treacherous.
whose arms hold you now
after my paradise grew from chaos?
whose name do you make
thunder the room?
is he a good man?
does he know my face?
does he look like me? 
do i keep him up at night?
           //
how old am i? today, i’m today.
i’m as old as whatever light touches me.
some nights i’m new as the fire at my feet
some nights i’m a star, glamorous, ancient
& already extinguished. we citizens 
of an unpopular heaven
& low-attended crucifixions. listen
i’ve accepted what i was given 
be it my name or be it my ender’s verdict.
when i was born, i was born a bull’s-eye.
i spent my life arguing how i mattered
until it didn’t matter. 
who knew my haven
would be my coffin?
dead is the safest i’ve ever been. 
i’ve never been so alive.

so dark, i got sca…i was doing my job.

that world of laws rendered us into dark

there, i drowned, back before, once. 
there, i knew how to swim but couldn’t.
there, men stood by shore & watched me blue.
there, i was a dead fish, the river’s prince. 
there, i had a face & then didn’t.
there, my mother cried over me
but i wasn’t there. i was here, by my own
water, singing a song i learned somewhere
south of somewhere worse.
now, everywhere i am is 
the center of everything. i must 
be the lord of something. 
what was i before? a boy? a son?
a warning? a myth? i whistled
now i’m the god of whistling.

girls braiding on golden stoops
but here—  
                     how could i ever explain to you—


            someone prayed we’d rest in peace

            in peace          whole          all summer"
Après le Feu,"I am safe in our home with my husband, living the life—
all new appliances. There’s that clip from Paris Is Burning 
when Venus Xtravaganza equates prostitution to what 
women in the suburbs do to get a washer and dryer. I 
was not trans like her or Anji but we did what we had to do 
to make our coins. I get to still be here today, too old to hustle, 
shoplift or risk getting killed. The only mopping I do these 
days is occasionally on the kitchen floor. In those days, 
everyone was afraid of dying of AIDS or simply dying. We 
belonged to Houses because most of us were homeless. Our 
fathers abandoned us because they already had families and 
our mothers cast us out as demons or something similar. We 
all had stories, many forgotten. Our parents were never wrong.
It was our fault if we came home bloodied from school or 
found dead in a cheap hotel room. No one felt bad for us—
the family, the cops, the government. We deserved it. That’s all.
But now children can choose their gender, be celebrated for 
coming out, live in fluidity. I survived at the expense of my sisters
being sacrificed. I remember the chicken hawks we fought off, 
the closet cases “On the DL!,” dark alleys, married men with 
wives at home cooking dinner, being a dirty little secret. And
now I only worry about paying Con Edison, ordering DoorDash, 
Amazon deliveries. We were criminals, prostitutes, destined for 
prison or hell. Now I Google my dead friends to see what is said
about them, make reservations to go out for “ouchie” dinners, 
plan our next vacations. I pay tribute with poems I read to high 
school students, inmates, nostalgic Nuyoricans. New generations
get crowned and walk away with Anastasia Beverly Hills cosmetics 
for being the best at what our girls were once eliminated for. If 
they were alive today, would they be celebrated? Or murdered in a 
world that’s still violent towards queer and trans people. There are 
essays and articles about how we lived. I tell my spouse stories as 
we dine somewhere safe and welcoming. I sleep like the child I 
never really got to be, dream for all our angels who never had this 
moment.

T4T,"There is no known root for how the word cum
came to mean what it does. But imagine
if you could stitch a lineage back to the Latin
cum meaning to step. Hence: movement.
Hence: a destination. The body moving,
perhaps dancing, toward a kind of end.
Vanishing point of flesh—trembling tongue
-fucked apocalyptic. Apocalypsis. A veil
shifted & what awaits beneath. A rose
by any other given name could still
draw blood if it wanted. But shit, turns out
there’s no emoji for a rubber dick
sat heavy on the tongue. Go figure. I can
still feel it twitch. Hold you in my mouth
spit slick apocrypha. Sweet faggot magic
the way we speak organs out of their
Christian names—lick cock to clit, bruise
breast to flattened chest, bury knuckles inside
a redrafted anatomy. Sucked finger shudder. Lust
-hot alchemy. Holy, how even the air becomes
wind when moving. Holy, how you fuck me
by my one unburied name. & when I tell you
how beautiful you are, you riot-laughter,
kiss me & call me a dyke. Your smile arrives,
day-bright, unburdens the slur of all its blood."

Celebrating Cinco de Mayo & clutching your purse as brown boys walk by. Fetishizing Latin lovers & sex-trafficking girls who speak Spanish. Getting displaced by gentrification & “They’re taking over our neighborhoods!” Somewhere between

de los Muertos & painting your face white to symbolize death. Somewhere between “You

have the right to remain silent!” and “Silence equals death.” Somewhere between
telenovelas and the new One Day at a Time. Somewhere between Richie Valens & Cardi

waiting on you to die so i can be myself,"a thousand years of daughters, then me.
what else could i have learned to be?
girl after girl after giving herself to herself
one long ring-shout name, monarchy of copper 
& coal shoulders. the body too is a garment.
i learn this best from the snake angulating 
out of her pork-rind dress. i crawl out of myself 
into myself, take refuge where i flee. 
once, i snatched my heart out like a track 
& found not a heart, but two girls forever 
playing slide on a porch in my chest.
who knows how they keep count
they could be a single girl doubled 
& joined at the hands. i’m stalling.
i want to say something without saying it 
but there’s no time. i’m waiting for a few folks 
i love dearly to die so i can be myself.
please don’t make me say who. 
bitch, the garments i’d buy if my baby
wasn’t alive. if they woke up at their wake 
they might not recognize that woman
in the front making all that noise."
“you don’t even know me/i’m hanging from a tree”,"you don’t even know me, i’m hanging from a dream.
me? in my last life? savage.  siren wet
& dreamlynched. me? was goodest pussy, nine lives all murdered
for my talent at my color, my sex, whatever he killed me for
i was the best at it. best blood-lipped dusk, 
best clotted sweetness, best bluing. me? once, i was born
the rope, not the neck. once, i was a fire full of niggers
(you know it’s happened, someone’s said that,
someone heard about the building candled while full
of screaming lil wicks & laughed. i was never that laugh.)
i was the hymn of nearing sirens in the dying ear
announcing not yet, sound entering & touching the mind.
i was mine once
                  & again in this life i’m mostly my own
somewhere far from your knowing, deep
in a Black mood, the wade of my heart making its way
to my brain carrying information, secrets, the rumor
of my body, the story i tell for wealth & the wealth
is worthless. they keep killing me, every time
i’m back by summer. i crawl out the sun. gold is useless
but in every life, i have it. look at me, up here
dangling like the poplar’s hidden tongue, like my tongue. 
look past the party at my feet, the children giddy
for a scorched finger. look me in what was my face 
deep into the smoky pit i used to pray & kiss

The Glassy Harbor,"O faint sad noises
and milky dullness,
rose-colored blindness
in evening gowns
how moist and rhythmic
those who walk near
the glassy harbor.
Silent drift of deserters
from the theater,
and everywhere the stars
receding, receding . . .
nothing to hold onto
but their own silver hearts."
Go Youth,"I was in a dreamstate and this was causing a problem
with the traffic. I felt lonely, like I’d missed the boat,
or I’d found the boat and it was deserted. In the middle
of the road a child’s shoe glistened. I walked around it.
It woke me up a little. The child had disappeared. Some
mysteries are better left alone. Others are dreary, distasteful,
and can disarrange a shadow into a thing of unspeakable beauty.
Whose child is that?"
The Ice Cream Man,"I answered the ad in the paper. I had been unemployed for
nine months and was desperate. At the interview, the man said,
“Do you have much experience climbing tall mountains?” “Absolutely.
I climb them all the time. If I see a tall mountain, I have to
climb it immediately,” I said. “What about swimming long distances
in rough ocean waters, perhaps in a storm?” he said. “I’m like
a fish, you can’t stop me. I just keep going in all kinds of
weather,” I said. “Could you fly a glider at night and land in
a wheat field, possibly under enemy fire?” he said. “Nothing
could come more naturally to me,” I said. “How are you with
explosives? Would a large building, say, twenty stories high
present you with much difficulty?” he said. “Certainly not. I
pride myself on a certain expertise,” I said. “And I take it you
are fully acquainted with the latest in rocket launchers and land-
mines?” he said. “I even own a few myself for personal use. They’re
definitely no problem for me,” I said. “Now, Mr. Strafford, or may
I call you Stephen, what you’ll be doing is driving one of our ice
cream trucks, selling ice cream to all the little kids in the
neighborhood, but sometimes things get tricky and we like all our
drivers to be well-trained and well-equipped to face any eventu-
ality, you know, some fathers can get quite irate if you are out
of their kid’s favorite flavor or if the kid drops the cone,” he
said. “I understand, I won’t hesitate to take appropriate action,”
I said. “And there are certain neighborhoods where you’re under
advisement to expect the worst, sneak attacks, gang tactics,
bodies dropping from trees or rising out of manholes, blockades,
machine gun fire, launched explosives, flamethrowers and that kind
of thing. You can still do a little business there if you are on
your toes. Do you see what I’m saying?” he said. “No problem. I
know those kinds of neighborhoods, but, as you say, kids still want
their ice cream and I won’t let them down,” I said. “Good, Stephen,
I think you’re going to like this job. It’s exciting and challenging.
We’ve, of course, lost a few drivers over the years, but mostly it
was because they weren’t paying attention. It’s what I call the Santa
Claus complex. They thought they were there just to make the kids
happy. But there’s a lot more to it than that. One of our best
drivers had to level half the city once. Of course, that was an
extreme case, but he did what needed to be done. We’ll count on you
to be able to make that kind of decision. You’ll have to have all
your weapons loaded and ready to go in a moment’s notice. You’ll
have your escape plans with you at all times,” he said. “Yes, sir,
I’ll be ready at all times,” I said. “And, as you know, some of
the ice cream is lethal, so that will require a quick judgment call
on your part as well. Mistakes will inevitably be made, but try
to keep them at a minimum, otherwise the front office becomes
flooded with paperwork,” he said. “I can assure you I will use it
only when I deem it absolutely necessary,” I said. “Well, Stephen,
I look forward to your joining our team. They’re mostly crack
professionals, ex–Green Berets and Navy Seals and that kind of
thing. At the end of the day you’ve made all those kids happy,
but you’ve also thinned out the bad seeds and made our city a
safer place to be,” he said. He sat there smiling with immense
pride. “How will I know which flavor is lethal?” I said. “Experiment,”
he said. I looked stunned, then we both started laughing."
"Tall Lyric for Palestine (Or, The Harder Thinking)","What doesn’t resemble me is more beautiful.
—Mahmoud Darwish, “To a Young Poet”
Because I should’ve wrote this years
ago, I’m crying. So what my slow
failure pass the years
 Make me be crying. So what
in Bethlehem I tried to push so
much against it, where the Wall is
checkpoint and weird. So what
 My lonelier, sadder blackeraches
kept from me a heard resonance with
the land thought against my body, so
what.
I arrived.

2. CHECKPOINT
And have known some privilege.

3. CHECKPOINT
And have seen some freedom.

4. CHECKPOINT
I mean, I told myself No, you shouldn’t
compare it—myself to Palestine—no,
I—

5. CHECKPOINT
But I compared it, drew that wound,
leaned into a kind of pity so new to me
who—
6. CHECKPOINT
—was so used to being all base &
bottom of the world; I tried, but felt
that distant, thieving love dilate my
eyes.

7.
And I cried, softly.

8.
So what I had not asked for, did not
want this. So what. I thought Tears
cheapened it, sissy’d it. So what.
     But was a newprivilege I met as
salt Slipped, downed and furthered
my face, an

     AMERICAN
                And then Black

privilege began to describe me.
Imagine that! I was some doubler
consciousness again,
 me watching four boys swing their
joy on an old couch-on-wheels
 Before that Wall’s forestalling
future, so who greeted them first was
my tears; they’re playing a game.
9.
A song: Palestine keeps a divided
home, where Blackness only roams.

10.
The tears! But panic I could call a film
for this frame that’s guilt, the next is
friendship: Am I what in Palestine?
 Or is it my “voice” insisting
the story, by certain marks, in
whisperings—What do I mean
 by Spirit?—of warring, intifada,
blood like Dew in the fields....
 The story is true.

11. THE WALL
Killings are thrilling, the Wall said,
and casual:
 (1) little infant trying—;
 (2) women in their—;
 (3) dogs sleeping;
 (4) boys.
 —What do I mean by Spirit?— The
birth of a nation means alway the
death of a former one.

12.
Sitting here near ole Bayou Road,
again all spleen. The Palestinian men
I try with my eyes stare back half-
meanly; they don’t know I know they
know I’m trans—but I am the lady,
herself, within. Fiercely her walk
pierces a New Orleans’ slick night.
They like it.

13. THE WALL
But I was saying the birth of a nation
means always the death of a second
one.
 Israel is real, trifling, in someone’s
mind.

14. I felt that. I was persuaded. The
film peeling across my eyes, only one
Palestine,
 Made protest against this fact
untenable, as if myself I could see in
those fields,
 Saw too the theft and strangle of
myself.

15. SOLIDARITY EXISTS
What’s solid in solidarity—All I know
is still nooses, crosses; still thorns—
then it was white phosphorus forming
the quick shadow of a boy called
Freedom—in whispering, in curtains
mark—I’m somehow a distance from.
 Admission is a later knowledge, I
think. A right of return.

16.
A slower knowledge. To know it was
my want to see myself as that boy I
was seeing, that ache again and in
myself to be, blackerache, the one
most hurt.

17.
Admission is a graver
knowledge, I think, trick
privilege, instance when,
tonight Maryam reminds
me,
 Recalled to just-that-
where White phosphorus is made.

“Arkansas, baby! oh, yeah—”
 I wonder if Palestine can
be Black? A Nigga be
Filinistina?
 And creole twain.
“And it pass right thru”—
peculiar—“that Port of New Orleans.”
Orleans.”
 Can—
18. CHECKPOINT
(They’re playing game)
 —they keep a divided home, where
how Blackness only roams?
 Friend. “Oh, it’s sick—”

18. CHECKPOINT
Light slides across the face of a body.
Dark does.

19. CHECKPOINT
The next shot is familiar:
 rows of cotton dipped in historical
red; burnt cork; crows; rows of bullets
ripped into some resembling, slum
skin, ache—
 But—

20. CHECKPOINT
—Try again: they are soldiers I am
seeing, Israeli, only the present tense,
I should’ve said this years ago.
 I should’ve made this article
confession, spelled out between poem
and novel years ago. Tall lyric, a space
of briar ambition and its mess of all
the violences witnessed—

21.
—and the beauty.
 I should loathe this gravity, of
those violences, these easy collisions I
make from item to idea or like to like.
 But I love to like, to raise the lyric
analogy and have you consume: the
way an eye carries down the page;
down the shallow energy of my head
voice now; because I bid it do, to the
hilt—
22. SEMICOLON —to the silt. These built up
semicolons, the top dot like the
soldier’s rifle target, the comma
dangling for how the dead do give
pause, I should hate it;
 I should spit, I should—

23. WANT
—need the harder thinking,
which is rigor gammed with care,
the possibility of that, that’s all,
unmannered, uneven—
 Like some New Orleanian unique
South, that occupies the psychot of
my brain’s desire, words I worry into
existence.

24. FREEDOM BEGS
Let’s say the freedom of poetry can be
the danger of it, could be the draw? So
what?
 Tried in Jerusalem; tried in
Hebron—
 But I saw everything I needed to
see in the labored chain-work of the
overhanging canopy that keeps—those
whisperings, certain marks—rocks
from falling on the shopkeepers’
heads;
 Took a video of the Palestinian
man who said, “Go back. Tell it.”

25. Who wants a pacifying gospel
delivered knows I cannot please them,
knows I cannot sincerely stop these
telling tears.
26. NIGHT-WALKING WOMAN
Yet I walk, eyes like a lady’s reminded
to my purpose with truth. Palestine
cries a divided home, where Blackness
bedamned to roam, and we share a
Dome.
 Friend, look in my eyes. To have
no home is yet a difference from the
denial of return, and don’t we both
ache for home?
 Slavery is true; as Occupation
remains true; as a sky cross-stitched
and beaded with turning danger is true:
Together our nights singly moan.

27.
I mean, I have not stopped this ego
rolled down my cheeks and who asked
for witness?

28. WITNESS
I first saw myself as the shame I took
fully for myself, those years ago—
 But was written away from it.
29. A free world, I think, is possible. I am
persuaded.
 I saw it in the still-for-singing
beauty of the land, how Palestine
makes a gold hum in my mouth. Saw
it in the not-now-warring, rolling hills
of Ramallah my feet at least tried to
walk frankly in and felt—

30. CHECKPOINT
—yes, a resonance. What could I
imagine now?

31. CHECKPOINT
What new eyes could I claim?

32. CHECKPOINT
What must you admit, really, to be
free?

33. CHECKPOINT
That I tried my body landing and
and thinking completely
Palestine, so what.

34. CHECKPOINT
And was I wrong?
Notes:

I first arrived in Palestine, through the Jordan corridor, with the Palestine Festival of Literature in 2016, accompanied by such elites as J. M. Coetzee and Saidiya Hartman. Though Hartman, the only other Black American on the caravan, passed through easily, I was barred for an hour at the first checkpoint. How come?

Where I mention “doubler consciousness” I refer to W. E. B. Du Bois’s theory of Black persons’ double consciousness, which keeps divided interests between Blackness and what he called “Americanness” (or whiteness) ever within the confines of Black life. Can there be more?

Where I mention “slum,” see the aforementioned Saidiya Hartman and her expansive theory on the afterlives of slavery and their impact on what she calls the “fungible body.” The slum, she theorizes, is where we find such marked bodies. But is that the only place?

I want to thank Sharif Abdul Koddous and all the organizers of the Palestine Festival of Literature; Kristina Kay Robinson, in whose seminal, performance project Republica: Temple of Color and Sound we meet Maryam DeCapita; and Ru Freeman, John Hennessy, and Emily Everett for all their various help in (re)shaping and shepherding this poem toward its present form. But is it done?"
Deer Skull Floating Over Blue Mountains (Four Panels),"i. 
Something like want but not                               for the body
how I look at a person and feel nothing most of the time
            except a desire to touch the wrist           of someone tired
who has said kind things to me
to want to blurt I love that you trust me
             that you look at me with such a full attention     asking     nothing
of me
and instead say I’m sorry someone treated you like shit
We’re home in how we listen
I don’t want to fuck or be fucked by anyone
I just want to hide safe in your heart cavity
I just want you to be well to love each sharp tooth in your throat as yours
How we all want to be made landscape with vertebrae
          someone could study with interest for hours
What I know from paintings of the virgin in her robe
      —prude church girl stuck-up bitch god how I have to keep saying
aroace
          is how some blues fade over time to just the lead
If I start licking the cobalt from your vein now in a hundred years it will
fade inside me to a ghost I can’t stop loving
  ii.
I’m sorry I could never soften a space inside me for the folks
who wanted me           the ones who leaned back against the railing
            of the fossil ashbed where we worked
            or asked if I wanted to dance after months of being friends
each time I said no to the question of laying beside each other
            I wanted to cup that face turning away from me
      jaw tightening wanted to say thank you for making me feel worth the risk I am whittling us out of whatever light’s left
of an unearthed horse mounted on this wall above the ashbed
and thinking of the dreams I’ve had the last few nights under desert stars
of platonic touch: a palm pressed my back
           during birth       someone embracing me when I am naked
           in the shower her black shirt sleeve scraping my ear
           someone offering their warm arm to help me down the stairs
I love when someone is turned away from me
           so fully absorbed in what they’re thinking how they’re breathing When I see a deer I smell my mother
           painting a skull on a deep blue background
           wind in the sockets dark hollows of fosse of cranium
  iii.
Did you know that I drew you, friend?              Your throat steepling
          blue sky with the long drop of a raven
welled like ink            our minds are something akin to one another
          Friend we are used to making space only for others
I cut open your heart: there’s nothing
to be afraid of              rattlesnake
babies nesting warm in your     chambers each of your pulses a wall
coaxing them to sleep               onyx into juniper through
                       high way unto                tendon undone by sun
            we don’t have to kiss     anybody
                                                  Sorry what was I saying
it’s just that you slid into the room on soft socks
just that you started humming that song again        without even realizing
it’s just your t-shirt with the holes in it
No one I love is mine              and this is what I love most
about living                even though
knowing each name                means missing someone
no one and nothing we love belongs to us       not even our breath
I can love you because I live alone and can go hide my spine in glacier
We can rest against my sick guts
             my belly a red rock wall ending in stars nail points in a night sky                     where dragonflies dart where I could catch each one hide it
                          between your shoulderblades for safekeeping
  iv.

My mother has spent a lifetime trying to draw her mother
as a skull and I have spent a lifetime trying to draw her
             gray threads of hair from out of my mouth
             her spotted hands tapping a paint brush four times on
             my back bristles dabbing cadmium cerulean lavender foothills
I have tried to distill everything down to this
the sun sparing nothing on the canvas
             my mother drawing me morphined in the hospital bed
             closing the studio door again after I asked love’s question
             so I had to watch her paint through the gaps in the hinges
I am painting a vagina I am painting my mother
I am making a page
                                           I hold my body and its word
                                           giving it space breath like she taught me
don’t pull back the white sheet from the canvas she’s working on
learn to read the shadows the undercoat of blue
             the lines she has drawn erased drawn again
             gray heel prints from her lead-coarsened hand

Thank You,"Why not a meadow?
Why not a little clearing and a stream
to wade in? Why not take our pants off,
a little respite from our partners
who couldn’t see us, who’d never see us
no matter what we did? What we did was wrong,
the way we did it. It was miraculous, 
it took hold long after
we trudged back to our spouses. 
So many years harboring a secret. 
Thank you for telling me 
about growing up in Queens, daddy’s 
milk truck skittering about Northern Boulevard 
looking for your favorite ice cream. 
And the darkness: how shades were drawn,
how your mother would never recover
from your father. How many of us 
have been stymied by those early dramas
until we married them? So many years, 
so many hungry years after. 
Thank you for the apricots in the mail,
thank you more for appearing at my door
with so little time left: no going back
to field our regrets. Old
as we are, you are here and now,
why not a meadow and a clearing?"
The Tree,"There are many types of trees

All different species that grow robustly

the silver birch
the tree of heaven
Some die of old age
or deforestation
or uprooted by a hurricane.
Infestations and diseases vary
from place to place.
Our family tree
has stopped growing.
No one waters it
no one visits it
it no longer bears fruit
no one asks why

Funeral for Unreturned Ashes,sent regrets by smoke // dull coatings of a time // now ambered // into its search for // a former light // when the world was not dark // just lightless // except for those flashpoints of skin // little currents that mark // the only things // we ever shared // to know we both craved // in the same brilliant age // a desire with gravity // the seedy impact of two bodies // who collide by choice // even at the cost of systems // still breaking // wills and testaments // that keep what remains // of you abroad // in a home you tried to make // but never bedded // until this restless sleep
Corsair,"Remember, every lover is a corsair seeking glory,
An x-marks-the-spot, a longing for invisible treasure,
Every lover is an end-point and a start-point
In the history of the world, a spark in the bright flare
Of the possible. Our swashbuckling lovers remind us:
Once we were lazing children,
Housebound and shoreless,
With no concept of the sea,
But now there’s the ocean’s blue spool,
Fleet-winged gulls, windblown caravels,
Even spouting whales,
Crow’s nests, and clouds like a white armada—
And so, when we relinquish the body’s treasure map, our lovers
Discover us the way the sailcloth in the rigging
Fills with the trade winds, from the last of the night’s stars
Through the lavish tangerine of dawn, our ships
Gliding over sheets of light-glazed silver."
The Voyage,"Exile begins now
among these clouds.
You can’t feel it yet
but the premonition wanders through the corridors
and makes silence pollute the air.
Here is the border between what you were
and the new dreams
that you will weave to save yourself.
Here also
the limits of the body
the symmetry of fatigue
the beginning of invisible lives
that follow one another simultaneously
on the planet of what would have been.
The past is kept in bubbles
where time does not pass
until your return
but if you don’t return
it is eradicated.
You won’t think of extinguishing
you will never again name the tragedy
the banishment
will hang from your eyelashes
like a permanent fruit
and you will bite from it
when the poison
begins to make tumors
in your mind.
    El viaje
El exilio comienza ahora
entre estas nubes.
No puedes sentirlo aún
pero el presentimiento se pasea por los pasillos
y hace que el silencio contamine el aire.
Aquí está la frontera entre lo que eras
y los nuevos sueños
que tejerás para salvarte.
Aquí también
los límites del cuerpo
la simetría del cansancio
el inicio de las vidas invisibles
que se suceden simultáneamente
en el planeta del qué habría sido.
El pasado se guarda en burbujas
donde el tiempo no pasa
hasta tu regreso
pero si no regresas
se extingue.
No pensarás en apagarte
no volverás a nombrar la tragedia
el destierro
colgará de tus pestañas
como fruta permanente
y morderás de él
cuando el veneno
empiece a hacer tumores
en tu mente."
The Play,"A mere story
a series of constructed incidents
a play
that could be rewritten in multiple ways
at any time
from all angles
with or without witnesses
alternative endings
if you go away
if you go away.
The scene stops
rewinds
repeats itself
with a slight alteration
the interruptions become
more and more strange
and almost painful
like thorns
in the part of memory you cannot reach.
The house
burns
plummets
disappears from the stage.
The narrative is never straightforward
each scene highlights the potential
for interruption
in this dream
as well as in the afterlife.
    La obra
Una mera historia
una serie de incidentes construidos
una obra de teatro
que podría reescribirse de múltiples formas
en cualquier momento
desde todos los ángulos
con o sin testigos
finales alternativos
si no te hubieras ido
si no te hubieras ido.
La escena se detiene
se rebobina
se repite
con una ligera alteración
las interrupciones se vuelven
cada vez más extrañas
y casi dolorosas
como espinas
en la parte de la memoria
que no alcanzas
a tocar.
La casa
se quema
cae en picada
desaparece del escenario.

La narración nunca es directa
cada escena resalta el potencial
para la interrupción
en este sueño
así como en el más allá."
Nostalgia,"The worst part of it is that I’ve forgotten your face. Or the idea that each tide was a slender finger pulling at these knots, loose end then left to work on another day. Lost at sea, love is a logogram: less than, fewer still, a word made nothing more than cauter-mark on starboard hard, port I left all those years ago. Sometimes, I dream of my own (sorry, our own) great-rooted bed, shaped from something still alive. Eurycleia means “broad fame” and that’s a sandy-pit, if you ask me. It’s an island beautiful as a scarred oxen’s back, sowed with lash and eyes. I saw something of you the other day in this glass of magic, vase filled with smoke’s children. There’s that dress you wore, I said to no one in particular. There’s that blue that never bled to red wine, dark in its never-nocked-arrow waves. And suddenly you’re the moon, again, lost in reflection’s sea. I follow the light to nowhere as I wander through the sipped sleeve. Because. Because you walked the stairs that night before I left, after we heard the rain spill like grain from a split sack. You walked in front of me, just above the cochineal stars, bright bald ember, fashioned still spear. I think of nothing else but you. It’s true. It’s the worst part of forgetting, all this remembering."
"East of Wyoming, I Remember Matthew Shepard","After The Entombment by Raphael
The night my father died, I sat on a stool 
          at the Buckhorn, gazing
                     out the window’s cool counter seat. 
Like a funhouse mirror, you appeared. 
          I have a familiar-looking face; my father used to say—
                     his wish for me to blend in. 
Late after an argument, I fled 
          and was found bound to a prairie fence 
                     after eighteen hours.
My body is like a sock in the wind 
          in a field just a mile from here. 
                     My face blooms, velvety 
and light like a lamb’s ear, 
          stachys byzantina; my ears 
                     frozen with blood; down 
my neck, it goes. A medley of ants shuffles 
          away. My body is rich with the sour smell 
                     of urine on my head like a crown of daffodils. "
The Mountains,"There is snow, now—
A thing of silent creeping—
And day is strange half-night . . .
And the mountains have gone, softly murmuring something . . .
And I remember pale days, 
Pale as the half-night . . . and as strange and sad.
I remember times in this room
When but to glance thru an opened window
Was to be filled with an ageless crying wonder:
The grand slope of the meadows,
The green rising of the hills,
And then far-away slumbering mountains—
Dark, fearful, old—
Older than old, rusted, crumbling rock,
Those mountains . . .
But sometimes came a strange thing
And theirs was the youth of a cloudlet flying,
Sunwise, flashing . . .
                  And such is the wisdom of the mountains!
                  Knowing it nothing to be old,
                  And nothing to be young!
There is snow, now—
A silent creeping . . .
And I have walked into the mountains,
Into canyons that gave back my laughter,
And the lover-girl’s laughter . . .
And at dark,
When our skin twinged to the night-wind,
Built us a great marvelous fire
And sat in quiet,
Carefully sipping at scorching coffee . . .
But when a coyote gave to the night
A wail of all the bleeding sorrow,
All the dismal, grey-eyed pain
That those slumbering mountains had ever known—
Crept close to each other
And close to the fire—
Listening—
Then hastily doused the fire
And fled (giving many excuses)
With tightly-clasping hands.
Snow, snow, snow—
A thing of silent creeping
And once,
On a night of screaming chill,
I went to climb a mountain’s cold, cold body
With a boy whose eyes had the ancient look of the mountains,
And whose heart the swinging dance of a laughter-child . . .
Our thighs ached
And lungs were fired with frost and heaving breath—
The long, long slope—
A wind mad and raging . . .
Then—the top!
                  There should have been . . . something . . .
                  But there was silence, only—
                  Quiet after the wind’s frenzy,
                  Quiet after all frenzy—
                  And more mountains,
                  Endlessly into the night . . .
                  And such is the wisdom of mountains!
                  Knowing how great is silence,
                  How nothing is greater than silence!
And so they are gone, now,
And they murmured something as they went—
Something in the strange half-night . . ."
Dream On,"Some people go their whole lives
without ever writing a single poem.
Extraordinary people who don’t hesitate
to cut somebody’s heart or skull open.
They go to baseball games with the greatest of ease
and play a few rounds of golf as if it were nothing.
These same people stroll into a church
as if that were a natural part of life.
Investing money is second nature to them.
They contribute to political campaigns
that have absolutely no poetry in them
and promise none for the future.
They sit around the dinner table at night
and pretend as though nothing is missing.
Their children get caught shoplifting at the mall
and no one admits that it is poetry they are missing.
The family dog howls all night,
lonely and starving for more poetry in his life.
Why is it so difficult for them to see
that, without poetry, their lives are effluvial.
Sure, they have their banquets, their celebrations,
croquet, fox hunts, their seashores and sunsets,
their cocktails on the balcony, dog races,
and all that kissing and hugging, and don’t
forget the good deeds, the charity work,
nursing the baby squirrels all through the night,
filling the birdfeeders all winter,
helping the stranger change her tire.
Still, there’s that disagreeable exhalation
from decaying matter, subtle but ever present.
They walk around erect like champions.
They are smooth-spoken, urbane and witty.
When alone, rare occasion, they stare
into the mirror for hours, bewildered.
There was something they meant to say, but didn’t:
“And if we put the statue of the rhinoceros
next to the tweezers, and walk around the room three times,
learn to yodel, shave our heads, call
our ancestors back from the dead—”
poetrywise it’s still a bust, bankrupt.
You haven't scribbled a syllable of it.
You're a nowhere man misfiring
the very essence of your life, flustering
nothing from nothing and back again.
The hereafter may not last all that long.
Radiant childhood sweetheart,
secret code of everlasting joy and sorrow,
fanciful pen strokes beneath the eyelids:
all clay, all night meditation, knot of hope,
kernel of desire, pure ordinariness of life,
seeking, through poetry, a benediction
or a bed to lie down on, to connect, reveal,
explore, to imbue meaning on the day's extravagant labor.
And yet it’s cruel to expect too much.
It’s a rare species of bird
that refuses to be categorized,
Its song is barely audible.
It is like a dragonfly in a dream—
here, then there, then here again,
low-flying amber-wing darting upward
and then out of sight.
And the dream has a pain in its heart
the wonders of which are manifold,
or so the story is told."
The Cowboy,"    Someone had spread an elaborate rumor about me, that I was
in possession of an extraterrestrial being, and I thought I knew who
it was. It was Roger Lawson. Roger was a practical joker of the
worst sort, and up till now I had not been one of his victims, so
I kind of knew my time had come. People parked in front of my
house for hours and took pictures. I had to draw all my blinds
and only went out when I had to. Then there was a barrage of
questions. “What does he look like?” “What do you feed him?” “How
did you capture him?” And I simple denied the presence of an
extraterrestrial in my house. And, of course, this excited them
all the more. The press showed up and started creeping around
my yard. It got to be very irritating. More and more came and
parked up and down the street. Roger was working overtime
on this one. I had to do something. Finally, I made an announcement.
I said, “The little fellow died peacefully in his sleep at 11:02
last night.” “Let us see the body,” they clamored. “He went up
in smoke instantly,” I said. “I don’t believe you,” one of them
said. “There is no body in the house or I would have buried it
myself,” I said. About half of them got in their cars and drove
off. The rest of them kept their vigil, but more solemnly now.
I went out and bought some groceries. When I came back about an
hour later another half of them had gone. When I went into the kitchen
I nearly dropped the groceries. There was a nearly transparent
fellow with large pink eyes standing about three feet tall. “Why
did you tell them I was dead? That was a lie,” he said. “You
speak English,” I said. “I listen to the radio. It wasn’t very
hard to learn. Also we have television. We get all your channels.
I like cowboys, especially John Ford movies. They’re the best,”
he said. “What am I going to do with you?” I said. “Take me
to meet a real cowboy. That would make me happy,” he said. “I
 don’t know any real cowboys, but maybe we could find one. But
people will go crazy if they see you. We’d have press following
us everywhere. It would be the story of a century,” I said.
“I can be invisible. It’s not hard for me to do,” he said.
“I’ll think about it. Wyoming or Montana would be our best bet, but
they’re a long way from here,” I said. “Please, I won’t cause
you any trouble,” he said. “It would take some planning,” I said.
I put the groceries down and started putting them away. I tried
not to think of the cosmic meaning of all this. Instead, I
treated him like a smart little kid. “Do you have any sarsaparilla?”
he said. “No, but I have some orange juice. It’s good for you,”
I said. He drank it and made a face. “I’m going to get the maps
out,” I said. “We’ll see how we could get there.” When I came
back he was dancing on the kitchen table, a sort of ballet, but
very sad. “I have the maps,” I said. “We won’t need them. I just
received word. I’m going to die tonight. It’s really a joyous
occasion, and I hope you’ll help me celebrate by watching The
Magnificent Seven,” he said. I stood there with the maps in my
hand. I felt an unbearable sadness come over me. “Why must
you die?” I said. “Father decides these things. It is probably
my reward for coming here safely and meeting you,” he said. “But
I was going to take you to meet a real cowboy,” I said. “Let’s
pretend you are my cowboy,” he said."
Goodtime Jesus,"Jesus got up one day a little later than usual. He had been dreaming so deep there was nothing left in his head. What was it? A nightmare, dead bodies walking all around him, eyes rolled back, skin falling off. But he wasn’t afraid of that. It was a beautiful day. How ’bout some coffee? Don’t mind if I do. Take a little ride on my donkey, I love that donkey. Hell, I love everybody."
To the Miscodeed,"Sweet pink of northern wood and glen,
E’er first to greet the eyes of men
In early spring,—a tender flower
Whilst still the wintry wind hath power.
How welcome, in the sunny glade,
Or hazel copse, thy pretty head
Oft peeping out whilst still the snow,
Doth here and there, its presence show
Soon leaf and bud quick opening spread
Thy modest petals—white with red
Like some sweet cherub—love’s kind link,
With dress of white, adorned with pink"
The Last Orgasm,"Stars and people and daffodils won’t last forever.
Hands down, forever will succumb to a single sensation,
one last heaven, one last shudder     
lost voice carried over the winds of the body, the canyons
of the hands in a shower, snow or warm? Last ashes
of satisfaction dance above an open mouth, teeth like light
in an emptied room, the wet music of the tongue.
Somebody will find the edge to all of humanity’s joy, a flood,
a punctuation will flood her with its certainty,
or them, or us, all at once, and that lonely breach
will ripple through, on and out, with indefatigable atoms.
Those asking hands never to slow their speeding ship     
one last starry daffodil excess will blow its soft dunes,
that lost voice, back, over everything that ever came
before. Until emptied out. And if you slow, if you slowly reach
across your own body until you feel it, too, even now?
You can come to an end, even now. It lasts, wanting to."
Bicuspid,"Of course the moment your parents mentally divorce
a baby gap appears between your two front teeth.
Then not before long your four canines follow suit
the way a pack of puppies might follow a child home
one afternoon—the half-eaten lunch in their book sack
crushed to unleash the mutt version of myrrh.
Finally, your molars & premolars no longer thirst
to slumber on the same cot, so branch off to sofas,
the floor, even wising up to comfort themselves in dirt.
So your poor parents, to save your gums from
hardening the way plaque steels the arteries, grief,
the heart, your parents are forced to break the bank
on turquoise braces for however many years it takes for
your smile to straighten itself out like the curve
of a swing when the sky plops down. They must
split the payments until your sore mouth no longer
doubts its separation. Your tastebuds chained beneath
and behind the fence your parents went Dutch
on like their first dates. The masseter carrying all
the bells & more whistle than master. & your tongue
in its lunacy pawing at every ivory picket for its escape."
Discoveries,"We are fine, even though we don’t feel well. 
Gaza is okay, although it has nothing to make her feel that way. 
In Gaza, the sun shines and the moon flirts with the leaves of the orange trees; 
However, Gaza’s people come and go empty-handed:
No good news to give to their children, 
no candy to sweeten their pale mouths, 
and no light to read by. "
Leaving Childhood Behind,"When I left, I left my childhood in the drawer
and on the kitchen table. I left my toy horse
in its plastic bag. 
I left without looking at the clock. 
I forget whether it was noon or evening. 

Our horse spent the night alone, 
no water, no grains for dinner. 
It must have thought we’d left to cook a meal 
for late guests or to make a cake
for my sister’s tenth birthday. 

I walked with my sister, down our road with no end. 
We sang a birthday song. 
The warplanes echoed across the heavens. 
My tired parents walked behind, 
my father clutching to his chest
the keys to our house and to the stable. 

We arrived at a rescue station. 
News of the airstrikes roared on the radio. 
I hated death, but I hated life, too, 
when we had to walk to our drawn-out death, 
reciting our never-ending ode. "
Pacific Trash Vortex,"The blackened wooden Buddha on my desk
is missing fingers on a chipped left hand
that cups the air, pacific face in dusk
gazing at zero as if to understand
how liquid time might freeze in his robe’s form,
like folded icicles. But, no. The world
deliquesces and flows like sewage whirled
through pipes and frothing sewers and out storm
drains, gathering in the North Pacific Gyre
––plastic bags like jellyfish, ghost nets,
the small white finger bones of cigarettes,
and polymers and sludge and other mire
that is our legacy of floating loss,
nibbled by pelicans and albatross.
 "
Worn,"He’s cleaning out the trunk in which his clothes 
are stored for summer, bathing suits, surf shorts, 
swimming goggles, neatly folded beach shirts,
all laundered, put in plastic, and then closed
away—and finds a black and silky bra, 
some short shorts with a tiny waist, a sleek 
black top, all empty of her, as is he, 
although she ghosts through him all night and gnaws
his dreams. They were so close he thought he wore 
her like a skin, as she wore him till they 
wore out. When doubt crawled in, she stored away 
her love and latched the trunk and left. It seems
he catches just a whiff of her somewhere
in the blouse. No, it’s clean. Too clean, too clean.
 "
Moving Day,"He piles her boxes in the courtyard under
a tarp, the bookshelves, microwave, spare phone,
and though his friends make clear they wonder
why he would help her move, he says, “It’s fine.
I want to save her money, help her out.”
And he does—helps her move out, feeling weight
tear at his muscles. Now he is without
her things. They are inside the truck, her freight,
then on the freeway, then in her new flat,
then gone. He’s glad to ache in shoulder blades
and arms. It means that though she’s left him flat,
left him behind like old footprints, he’s made 
a choice as well, to move her, remove her,
a choice to move past, not be moved by her.
 "
What Her Father Said,"After the barbeque the men stayed out
in the cold garden drinking sake, rum,
and whiskey, stomachs warm and fingers numb.
The yellow cat began to nose about
the chicken bones and cold asparagus,
leftover steak and daikon radish, salt
soy beans, cucumber salad. “It’s my fault,”
he said, “She doesn’t want me.” “Just give us
some time,” her father said—his gray hair tied back—
gripped his son-in-law’s hands across the table
and held them tight, tight. “Listen to me,”
he said, “In Japan, we say a dog is able
to eat all things, will even lick its ass.
But marriage trouble, even dogs won’t eat.”"
The Audit,"The time has come he never thought would come
when he sees her see in him just defects.
As if his heavy love has kept her down,
what once she thought was perfect she rejects.
She takes an audit of his qualities,
subtracts affection, multiplies distress,
and so, in sum, she takes his sum and sees
the countless reasons she should need him less.
She knows him better than he knows himself
so, if she finds his love to be oppression,
and reads all the good years as years of lies,
then he must turn his mind against himself
and see, laid out in infinite regression,
his net and gross of failure in her eyes.
 "
Plans for the Future,"She watches as he signals to the waiter.
He doesn’t note how silent she is now,
he doesn’t catch her sadness, can’t see how
her eyes go dark and still as standing water.
Behind them in a fluid tangle, strange
ideas swim in black spirals, entwined
like eels. She watches how the subtle wind
tears at her husband’s hat. It isn’t strong
enough to toss it to the sky, but tugs
and grabs and shakes and doesn’t stop. Perhaps
a hurricane is needed. What she hopes:
a bomb will drop, all things will die but bugs,
the continent will slip into the sea,
the planet will implode, and she’ll be free.
 "
Nightmare Kiss,"The middle of a kiss, and though he opened
up wide and wider, her own small jawbones gave
a little crack and stuck, and look what happened:
as if she’d fallen in an open grave,
he swallowed her at last, and then she wandered
in a dark saturated country where
the red land throbbed with capillaries under
electric stars. A kiss had brought her there,
a simple kiss that rained and filled her head
with blood, a nightmare kiss, a wrong man kiss;
why had she kissed a man with such a mouth,
with such thick teeth and jaws, such tongue, instead
of kissing someone who would let her out,
kissing someone nicer, who ate less."
What is Home?,"What is home: 
it is the shade of trees on my way to school
    before they were uprooted.
It is my grandparents’ black-and-white wedding 
    photo before the walls crumbled. 
It is my uncle’s prayer rug, where dozens of ants
   slept on wintry nights, before it was looted and 
   put in a museum. 
It is the oven my mother used to bake bread and 
   roast chicken before a bomb reduced our house 
   to ashes. 
It is the café where I watched football matches
   and played—

My child stops me: Can a four-letter word hold
   all of these? "
Displaced,"In memory of Edward Said
I am neither in nor out. 
I am in between. 
I am not part of anything. 
I am a shadow of something. 
At best, 
I am a thing that 
does not really 
exist. 
I am weightless, 
a speck of time
in Gaza. 
But I will remain
where I am.
   "
Roman Triptych,"I
Red stones piled in square towers.
Red roads cruise aqueducts.
Blue chain by the door
strikes a bell.
From our gold-draped room
the windows with their astragals and sashes
glass out the bottle-green hills.
I hold her naked on the carpet,
my body spilling
out of my lavender dress.
Body, if you could be forever
spilling out of your lavender dress.
  II
Twin redheads fondle twin
Barbies, sliding sateen dresses
on and off the dolls’ voluptuous physiques.
I tread on a grate and in a cloud
of vertiginous steam see in a store window my hands
disappearing under a mannequin’s skirt.
The noise of a drill down the avenue
like whipped cream shooting from a can.
  III
My hair tangles her fingers
till I unknot it, and I unknot it
as I’ve done many things
to detach myself
from pleasure.
She says the words I use remind her
that she is reading a poem,
referring to the above vertiginous—
Reader, I want you to know you are reading a poem.
What is the point of talking otherwise?
     "
The Night Before I Leave Home,"my brother gets out of bed at three, having lain down
only a few hours before, and pulls on his jeans, and stubs his toe
     on the doorjamb,
and cuts himself, just a scratch, reaching too fast in the dark
for wallet and keys—and the weapon? A bill, probably.
He goes out under the huge sky, out of the small house
and beyond, fields upon fields, where as children we played
     hide-and-seek and tag
and all those games, I miss them. All we imagined. In my
     brother’s mind
the fuzziness of the awakened-too-soon after not-enough-sleep
and the resentful calm that comes
when doing your duty to those you love,
to whom you could not
do otherwise.
He drives too fast, as always, braking hard when he
     finally arrives
at the meadow my car slid into before it slid
into an oak
where a whitetail hangs, strung
by its hind legs to drain the slit throat.
It takes more time than I expected
for death to be over,
I tell my brother. And he, a hunter, says, Yeah
in the tone that means, Of course.
And years later I have the same voice
when he calls at 4:17 a.m. and I knock the phone off the bed,
answering almost upside-down, stretched toward him.
His pain then, I lived for it, I realize now.
Not for its existence, but to quiet with my words.
I had left so long ago. I had left.
The doe’s eyeshine keeps us company. We joke
about our dead new friend. We share a half-drunk fifth
of Jim Beam tugged from under the passenger seat.
By the time the tow truck rumbles up, it’s well into dawn.
We are giddy—like children
who have played a game so wholly they have forgotten
the rules of the real world, and naturally
don’t want to remember. My brother turns to me near sunrise
to ask, What do you think he’s doing? Right now?
And I spin a story of a father
waking to polish his teeth, spit blood
into the eye of a porcelain bowl, wash a face like my brother’s.
That was a game, yes, us seeking the man
he was when not hurting us one and then the other,
and then the game ended
as children’s games do, when authority says
it’s time to disperse,
when the other gets on a plane, and one is left."
Notes Toward an Elegy,"The Cypriot sun is impatient, a woman undressed
who can’t spare the time to dress, so light
like a vitrine holds even a storm.
One day in the Old City, a pineapple rain.
And I’m on my way home from the pharmacy, carrying my
   little bag of cures.
Refuge at the café in the nameless square.
Nihal brings espresso poured over ice, turns off the music.
We listen to rain fall through the light until the end.
White wine greening in a glass.
Lion rampant in the sky. Moon reclined gorgeous in her silver shift.
Polished newels. Door askew in its frame.
Hot mornings. Hot apple tea, honeyed.
The mountains a fist knuckled on the horizon.
Dust is coming, dust is not yet here.
Whenever her hands dance, I tell her how beautiful.
She says there’s so much other movement I do not perceive.
And I accept the presence of dances invisible to me.
Figs in the tree, figs on the stones.
Stains of rotting fruit spread and shadow at the sun’s whim.
That steady dissolution of body into form that signals the progress
   of a masterpiece.
Copper bowl in her hands. In the bowl in the hands, olive leaves
   burn.
I ask her to read to me. I like the way her voice handles words.
What will she read? First she laughs.
It’s a good day to laugh. The coffee is strong. And the light.
Why read when we can talk? When all our friends are here?
My perversity is silence, a shudder stopped
in the throat. When all the time I hear her voice:
I am glad my soul met your soul.
—Examples of what, I do not know. It’s just that
for a time I took Love out walking
with me everywhere and sometimes I thought, Child, whose
   is this child?
when it played in the square. A sunshine creature, terrifying,
yet still I looked at it like I’ve never looked at a stranger
who promises water to the waterless for nothing.
And now I lie awake pretending everyone in the world
lies still the way the living are still:
not entirely, never entirely."
Triptych in Black and Blue,
The Specious Present,"I stared at the tiny xeroxed faces 
we wore like blurry jokes
pinned to our lapels.
Outside, the light raked the dry brown foothills 
we slid down on flattened cardboard boxes,
decades ago, out of control, fast,
fast as years. 
I still love the California hills,
I still love boxes and the way a word 
is a box. It holds things,
flotsam holding flotsam. 
Be the void, said the strobe-light disco ball.
The red wine warmed in my hands, it
spilled on my bare feet as I danced
above the San Andreas Fault.
“Cathy,” they called me that night,
and in the reunion’s obsolete blear
I looked a little like a Cathy, 
or a Nadia, unrecognizable save for the eyes 
and the animal drive to throw herself 
into a long line of aerial cartwheels, 
propelled forward and upside down 
past language into anachronistic light. "
A Marriage at Ancestral Hall in Sun Village,"She will never return home. In their first meeting, he asks to touch her skin. To touch or to feel. He asks her to climb a ladder so that he may see her legs, whether a pig can walk through them. I imagine once she begins climbing the ladder, she cannot stop. If the 1906 earthquake had fallen a day later, he would have set sail across the ocean four years earlier and the matchmaker would not have called her name. Think of the particular light cast across her skin as she lifts her sleeve for him, as she ascends the ladder, perhaps gathering the hem of her dress in one hand. This light will take her from her country. She will have seven children in California. When she receives word of her mother’s death, she will climb on the roof and let down her hair. Her hair was a kind of ladder, pinned and smoothed, you would never find it. We look upon the ocean so easily from this distance. She lifted her sleeve, she climbed the ladder of her hair every morning. The particular light against her skin. A different ocean moved through her—her blood in my blood with his blood."
What I Was Looking For,"were the unsent letters she’d left me years ago 
and which I hadn’t had the heart to read.
I’d found everything else. Or rather,
everything that could be found 
on paper, loose and bound, large, small,
smaller still, the size of fortunes fluttering to the floor
like moths, a message on each wing.
So many poems, by me but mostly others, 
some on slick paper I’d cut poorly from a page. 
My mother always said I was bad at scissors,
and I’ve often accidentally cut myself 
as if to prove her point. But now, both parents dead, 
it was time, I thought, I had the time and
courage, I thought, and I found the letters—
I was going to say, in the last place I looked, 
but of course, where else?—and when I read them
they were a marital memoir full of disappointments 
as familiar to me as my own
skin, and the bitter recriminations she was desperate 
to impart so that I might . . . avenge her? forgive her? 
I can’t say for sure. All I know is
I buried them both, in separate graves. I held their bodies
and most of their words and made my own from theirs.
I lay them down on this white field, another, another,
and another. If you look for us, look behind 
the letters, beneath the field to the blood."
A Vision of the End,"I once beheld the end of time!
   Its stream had ceased to be.
The drifting years, all soiled with crime,
   Lay in a filthy sea.
The prospect o’er the reeking waste
   Was plain from where I stood.
From shore to shore the wreckage faced
   The surface of the flood.
There all that men were wont to prize
   When time was flowing on,
Seemed here to sink and there to rise
   In formless ruin blown.
In slimy undulations roiled
   The glory of the brave;
The scholar’s fame, the rich man’s gold,
   Alike were on the wave.
There government, a monstrous form
   (The sea groaned ’neath the load),
A helpless mass blown by the storm,
   On grimy billows rode.
The bodies of great syndicates
   And corporations, trusts,
Proud combinations, and e’en states,
   All beasts of savage lusts,
With all the monsters ever bred
   In civilization’s womb,
Lay scattered, floating, dead,
   Throughout that liquid tomb.
It was the reign of general death,
   Wide as the sweep of eye,
Save two vile ghosts that still drew breath
   Because they could not die.
Ambition climbed above the waves
   From wreck to wreck he strove.
And as they sank to watery waves,
   He on to glory rode.
And there was Greed—immortal Greed—
   Just from the shores of time.
Of all hell’s hosts he took the lead,
   A monarch of the slime.
He neither sank below nor rose
   Above the brewing flood;
But swam full length, down to his nose,
   And steered where’er he would.
Whatever wreckage met his snout
   He swallowed promptly down—
Or floating empire, or redoubt,
   Or drifting heathen town.
And yet, it seemed in all that streaming waste
There nothing so much gratified his taste
As foetid oil in subterranean tanks,
And cliffs of coal untouched in nature’s banks,
Or bits of land where cities might be built,
As foraging plats for vileness and guilt;
Or fields of asphalt, soft as fluent salve
Or anything the Indian asked to have.
I once beheld the end of time!
   Its stream had run away;
The years all drifted down in slime,
   In filth dishonored lay."

The Indian’s Awakening,"I snatch at my eagle plumes and long hair.
A hand cut my hair; my robes did deplete.
Left heart all unchanged; the work incomplete.
These favors unsought, I’ve paid since with care.
Dear teacher, you wished so much good to me,
That though I was blind, I strove hard to see.
Had you then, no courage frankly to tell
Old-race problems, Christ e’en failed to expel?
My light has grown dim, and black the abyss
That yawns at my feet. No bordering shore;
No bottom e’er found my hopes sunk before.
Despair I of good from deeds gone amiss.
My people, may God have pity on you!
The learning I hoped in you to imbue
Turns bitterly vain to meet both our needs.
No Sun for the flowers, vain planting seeds.
I’ve lost my long hair; my eagle plumes too.
From you my own people, I’ve gone astray.
A wanderer now, with no where to stay.
The Will-o-the-wisp learning, it brought me rue.
It brings no admittance. Where I have knocked
Some evil imps, hearts, have bolted and locked.
Alone with the night and fearful Abyss
I stand isolated, life gone amiss.
Intensified hush chills all my proud soul.
Oh, what am I? Whither bound thus and why?
Is there not a God on whom to rely?
A part of His Plan, the atoms enroll?
In answer, there comes a sweet Voice and clear,
My loneliness soothes with sounding so near.
A drink to my thirst, each vibrating note.
My vexing old burdens fall far remote.
“Then close your sad eyes. Your spirit regain.
Behold what fantastic symbols abound,
What wondrous host of cosmos around.
From silvery sand, the tiniest grain
To man and the planet, God’s at the heart.
In shifting mosaic, souls doth impart.
His spirits who pass through multiformed earth
Some lesson of life must learn in each birth.”
Divinely the Voice sang. I felt refreshed.
And vanished the night, abyss and despair.
Harmonious kinship made all things fair.
I yearned with my soul to venture unleashed.
Sweet freedom. There stood in waiting, a steed
All prancing, well bridled, saddled for speed.
A foot in the stirrup! Off with a bound!
As light as a feather, making no sound.
Through ether, long leagues we galloped away.
An angry red river, we shyed in dismay,
For here were men sacrificed (cruel deed)
To reptiles and monsters, war, graft, and greed.
A jungle of discord drops in the rear.
By silence is quelled suspicious old fear,
And spite-gnats’ low buzz is muffled at last.
Exploring the spirit, I must ride fast.
Away from these worldly ones, let us go,
Along a worn trail, much travelled and—Lo!
Familiar the scenes that come rushing by.
Now billowy sea and now azure sky.
Amid that enchanted spade, as they spun
Sun, moon, and the stars, their own orbits run!
Great Spirit, in realms so infinite reigns;
And wonderful wide are all His domains.
Hark! Here in the Spirit-world, He doth hold
A village of Indians, camped as of old.
Earth-legends by their fires, some did review,
While flowers and trees more radiant grew.
“Oh, You were all dead! In Lethe you were tossed!”
I cried, “Every where ’twas told you were lost!
Forsooth, they did scan your footprints on sand.
Bereaved, I did mourn your fearful sad end.”
Then spoke One of the Spirit Space, so sedate.
“My child, We are souls, forever and aye.
The signs in our orbits point us the way.
Like planets, we do not tarry nor wait.
Those memories dim, from Dust to the Man,
Called Instincts, are trophies won while we ran.
Now various stars where loved ones remain
Are linked to our hearts with Memory-chain.”
“In journeying here, the Aeons we’ve spent
Are countless and strange. How well I recall
Old Earth trails: the River Red; above all
The Desert sands burning us with intent.
All these we have passed to learn some new thing.
Oh hear me! Your dead doth lustily sing!
‘Rejoice! Gift of Life pray waste not in wails!
            The maker of Souls forever prevails!’”
Direct from the Spirit-world came my steed.
The phantom has place in what was all planned.
He carried me back to God and the land
Where all harmony, peace and love are the creed.
In triumph, I cite my Joyous return.
The smallest wee creature I dare not spurn.
I sing “Gift of Life, pray waste not in wails!
The Maker of Souls forever prevails!”"
On the Good Ship Elijah McClain,"“Black skin is an accelerant.”
                          -Malcolm Gladwell

In Shiatsu the high seas of pressure points woo him,
how touch restores, relieves, cures, resets the knee,

a child who sometimes lived in cars, taught himself
to play guitar, discovered bioluminescence, unearthing
a tender aptitude for the mining of his own light.

At the Aurora hotel where he lived with his family,
he forecasted his dream board to his mother,
Work on a Cruise ship, Give free massage, Heal the world.

While waiting for his figment freighter Elijah played
first violin to abandoned cats in shelters, silky moiré
strings fracturing their leonine loneliness.

10 pm. Just before they contort him into twin carotids,
his brother dreams of iced tea. A young man with light
aptitude has no fear of moving through the blueberry

leaves of night. Elijah ups his ski mask, earphones, sea
lion aura, he is back inside his wetsuit, the cats back at
the shelter glance towards the door for the man with the

long gliding stick, who curtseys to them before playing
for them. He dives into his starlight, swimming beyond
his lungs, his far-sightedness, his anemia, frightened off.

He is salt warm, piquant, his blood thicker, the blue
green algae of his mind perfuming his hybrid lungs,
krill and seaweed inhaled, mixing with the microfibers

around his bashful mouth. The red ringed octopus
that swims with him whenever he ventures out this late
lightly touches Elijah’s face with the tip of his fifth arm.

His terrestrial anxiety lifts as he descends to his mud
bottom land. A hunter-gatherer, safely behind the
safety glass of his window, is already on the phone

turning Elijah in, reporting a sea monster in black
ski mask walking by, his ten arms waving “sketchy”
in the night air. Elijah McClain has no man-made

weapons, nothing but his dark sea urchin skin,
soft silvery scales, two shimmering nocturnal eyes,
a shark skin boy, cooing to himself, headed back

to the Aurora hotel after scoring his brothers iced
tea. Elijah is now his own deep. The first one yells
for him to stop. His Black boy gills tingle with his

endangeredness. The sea is the authority. He keeps
his arms moving. His skinny legs send one final
memo up to the mouth of his ski mask: Once upon

a time, 10 million years before, feet were fins. Behind the
mask Elijah smiles into a long hanging stalactite
of prehistoric memory, the hunter-gatherers have

surrounded him, his black skin beneath his black
mask is their favorite red meat, beating their chests,
their body cameras drop-disappear into ancient

fjords. These HG’s know nothing of the sea from
whence they came, rock-hard terrestrials needing
their pressure points attended to — topple him.

It’s five against one when the whale hook is force fed
into his arm. Elijah’s glittering sea horse veins are hosed
down, 1963 Birmingham, a Niagara Falls of Ketamine,

the treble clef tattoo on Elijah’s right shoulder bugles
the alarm, a netting of squid ink lassoes out to protect
his gentle collagen carapace. Elijah’s heart is up in arms,

his lungs and liver are foaming at the mouth, in utter
disbelief, the great inaccuracy, the intentional historical
disregard, the human they have coupled with for twenty-

three years, his royal kindness, his dream of free massage
for all, now gasping for breath. Elijah enters the slippery
river rocks of semi-unconsciousness. His toes wiggle for

nitrogen, bouncing against the boulders of the white
waters of the Colorado River. His heart signs for him
to push his voice up through his gurgling organ pipes,
  “I am an introvert…please…”
                              (he tenders)
“Respect the boundaries….please…”
                              (he sets forth)
“I’m just different, that’s all…”
                              (he proffers)
“Leave me alone…please…”
                              (he insists)
“I have no gun. I intend to take my power back…”
                             (he speaks his motion)
“I have a right to where I am going…”
                              (he overtures)
“I’m so sorry.”

The kindest man on earth apologizes, unable to
control his spewing, everything they have gorged
him with now hurling through the August air.
ii

One day, on the Good Ship Elijah McClain,
after checking into our deep-sea cabins, black
ski masks handed out with tangerine life savers,

we will find ourselves on deck bowing, curtseying
to each other. At first, it will all feel so silly, the
gravitational surrender of our upper bodies and

knees to the maritime mystery of someone we
do not know, just to be sure and say before the
day is done, I watched your glass octopus dancing down

the dark wet street last night and I am no longer afraid
for you to know how shamelessly your sonata for Manx
and Maine Coon turned me inside out."
The Earthlings,"The Earthlings arrived unannounced, entered
without knocking, removed their shoes 
and began clipping their toenails. 
They let the clippings fall wherever.  
They sighed loudly as if inconvenienced.
We were patient. We knew our guests
were in an unfamiliar environment; they needed 
time to adjust. For dinner, we prepared
turkey meatloaf with a side of cauliflower. 
This is too dry, they said.
This is not like what our mothers made. 
We wanted to offer a tour of our world, 
demonstrate how we freed ourselves 
from the prisons of linear time.
But the Earthlings were already spelunking 
our closets, prying tools 
from their containers and holding them 
to the light. What’s this? they demanded.
What’s this? What’s this? And what’s this?
That’s a Quantum Annihilator; put that down.
That’s a Particle Grinder; please put that down.  
We could show you how to heal the sick, we said.
We could help you feed every nation, commune 
with the all-seeing sentient energy that palpitates 
through all known forms of matter. 
Nah! they said. Teach us to vaporize a mountain! 
Teach us to turn the moon into revenue! 
Then the Earthlings 
left a faucet running and flooded our basement."
"( . . . As for the Swallows, All They Were Doing)","as far as I am able to see all
the ways it works     all
they were doing was eating
the evening meal—

whether hunger made it that particular
pass-out gravitational pull up turning
as I see it         exciting
or pressurized as simply necessary

to eat to live        I’m not in on that swing
of evolution that these birds are
to know        I can only admire

the shit-your-pants come round about curves
they swallow with a grace such as
I take        in
 
                   my stamp    open screaming mouth—
teddi said she used to know me to be quiet
mute if not silent    and when she said I’d
grown up to be a blabbermouth     the whole house
broke out the laughter   to celebrate her

her loving insult     her lovely truth    we don’t talk
pretty.       we people tracking our hungers
plotted against by merely being   us plotted against
black our being eaten     swallowed in the calculations of

white sheets taking off high flying plans for turning
back any move forward we tried with any curve they could
try to pull           but us neither well behaved as pretended

we intended to take this that we could take
these sickening curves thrown    back down your throat
and make you sick feeding         what you feed us     watching

Because Nāmakaokahaʻi killed her sister at Kaiwiopele,"there is a poem forever eating
our ankles, like the eel who left
me in brackish water, bleeding
near the hill named for death.
Your ankles were left for the eel,
I imagine grandma explaining.
Kaiwiopele is a death-dealing hill.
We feed that pain as a family.
I imagine grandma explaining
how to brace against my own sister’s
bones. I’d rather starve.
Who will believe in this red, moaning cinder
if I never learn how to hold you?
If I am written as water and you as blood,
who surrenders in the poem first? 
Can we kill the poem? Kill it forever.

                The Atlantic, Sept. 21, 2019
Land slit like a throat, life poured out
like gold coins on cobblestone. Confessions
pulled from tongues like toenails off toes.
Piled with scorched scrolls: our paschal pyre,
confessions extracted like gold, coins swallowed
then picked from the coals. Nothing sacred
but pyres piled, a pathetic penance, my hands
washed with my blood, an act of faith?
Is nothing sacred but my ashes, picture
of oblivion, my name oblivion? My faith forgets
its name, washed with blood, my act
of courage or escape. Am I nothing? What is nothing?
Oblivion forgets my name, my faith the thing
they cannot take, the gold I protect with my life.
What is courage or escape? It is nothing I can lose
or forsake, they took everything that tied me to this place.
They cannot take my faith, I protect it like gold
pulled from tongues like toenails off toes,
there’s nothing left to tie me to this place.
Land slit like a throat, gold poured out."
Memory of One Day in a Kitchen,"It wasn’t complete,
              only two hours
                            I spent with you,
the light coy until evening—
              my rapid blinking,
                            the way a girl did
once in a movie
              unworthy of the ticket’s price.
                            I felt so beautiful—
but then I called my mother
              and she made a noise when
                            I said I could love you.
She was remembering
              Daddy—
                            what she was wearing,
what he was wearing,
              each word they said,
                            what everything meant
or would come to mean.
              In her alternate dreams, they
                            hadn’t married. She’d
taken the fellowship,
              studied overseas
                            in France—
but don’t get her wrong,
              she’s not bitter.
                            In fact, she’s perfectly fine.
She didn’t understand
              that I knew different:
                            I’m one of the few,
good moments
              she shared with that pretty,
                            redbone man.
She was thinking blue dress
              and tweed jacket
                            and 1958
when I said we sat at the table,
              speaking in hesitations.
                            Before we kissed
you took off your glasses,
              closed your eyes
                            while describing a moment
you wanted me to see.
              What if I’d reported my insanity to her?
                            That I’d bought condoms
for you.
              I was wearing new panties.
                             I’d shaved the tenderness
between my thighs,
              but after you kissed me,
                             that was it.
You left—
              I sat there,
                             the cork in the wine
bottle mocking
              me with its wistful,
                             funky smell.
It was a day of separation:
              the time before,
                             when a woman wouldn’t
look for signs.
              The time after,
                             when a woman
could lose her mind,
              believe a note buried
                             in a man’s laughter,
no matter what she says:
              Girl,
                             I’m through
with that sorry story.
              I’m way past all of that."

EMDR,"Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing is a psychotherapy
that enables people to heal from the symptoms and emotional distress
that are the result of disturbing life experiences. Repeated studies show
that by using EMDR therapy people can experience the benefits of
psychotherapy that once took years to make a difference. It is widely
assumed that severe emotional pain requires a long time to heal. EMDR
therapy shows that the mind can in fact heal from psychological trauma
much as the body recovers from physical trauma. When you cut your
hand, your body works to close the wound. If a foreign object or
repeated injury irritates the wound, it festers and causes pain. Once the
block is removed healing resumes. EMDR therapy demonstrates that a
similar sequence of events occurs with mental processes. The brain’s
information processing system naturally moves toward mental
health. If the system is blocked or imbalanced by the impact of a
disturbing event, the emotional wound festers and can cause intense
suffering. Once the block is removed, healing resumes. Using the
detailed protocols and procedures learned in EMDR therapy training
sessions, clinicians help clients activate their natural healing processes.

Draft of an Ex-Colored Letter Sent Home From the Post-Race War Front,"A soldier in Baldwin’s Country & I can’t even dance
           I say you can’t beat me     Each day I get up to face fear

I made money & fixed my credit     I escaped you dear     my shame
           Yet how to escape white space     It’s impossible

to return to your embrace     to rough-trading sweet vowels
           to brothers on corners visiting my dreams     I hear your whistles

smell collard greens on suburban wind     I love you with deception
           I’ll be back     I’ll lift as I climb     My remorse goes deep

to the whiteness in me     my bones     Forgive me     You don’t know
           the trouble I see     I can’t tell these folks the truth

They don’t understand me & they don’t try     Or try too hard
           I want my birthright     a mutual sight     my own ancient rime

In the bright trenches of the office     I open my mouth but choke
           on bottled water     Last week     I returned for your wake

but left before the Home-Going     I miss our surviving dark ones
           The familiar is trivial & profound     The strange a charge

in my blood     I clutch & shriek at these strangers I left drums for
           I sing B.B.’s mean old song"
Far Away,"The first cold rains scurry down the gold
tipped September elms. I know
she will not be in her bedroom, a room
I realize I have hardly entered
these last few years, the door so rarely
unlocked. But walking by with a basket
of laundry for my son, I am pulled
by a thread, I think, of her perfume
adrift in the hall, her door ajar, a window
that must be cracked to the cross breeze.
I set the basket down. The white door
turns on its hinges with a whisper
of my fingers and I step through. Her ceiling
LEDs are not lit, and her desk is not
a mess of bowls and mugs, books and
oil paints No aluminum wrappers from chips
and protein bars. Her purple blanky does
not hang at the edge of her unmade bed.
No, the bed is made. The closet, half open,
is not quite empty. And not balled on the floor,
the tie-dyed T she so often wore to sleep.
When I catch myself in the floor length
mirror, I’m not as small as I imagined I’d be.
No, I don’t look different at all. I’ve lost
now, her scent, that curl of flower that must 
have slipped past me like a wraith, 
like a breath of days spun through years, 
like a rain that hushes the silence."
"A Massive Aquarium Holding 1,500 Tropical Fish Bursts","& each fish feels solid land before its gills
cease moving. I miss sex but can’t imagine 
dating. Glass shatters in patterns designed 
for a specific aftermath. What confession  
offers isn’t relief. From my bed, coverlet tucked 
under chin, I heard my father’s hand connect 
with my mother’s cheek. A fish slap requires 
actual fish-to-face contact. Windowpanes 
bust in shards. Car windshields spider & smash
into square chunks or mini blocks, so on impact 
they won’t decapitate or slash the face. A tank’s
ideal temperature for tropical fish is 75 to 80 degrees. 
I tried to learn how to stab the worm on the hook 
to bait the prey, but in the end I was only called 
a pussy. Tackle box tipped over, the red & white
striped sleek lure. Don’t they think of everything: 
claims to cover any minor loss, inspections to avert 
damage. Even so, at the health center, the multiple-choice
form omits the oval to fill in adopted so I leave 
the question blank. We’re here to consider my choices
in contraception, how to prevent an itchy rash down there 
& to discuss the definitions of sex & life. What’s hereditary 
gets lost to wonderland, elsewhere a consultant advises 
curators on predation, tells the team which fish to import 
for show-stopping colors & compatibility. But we know 
the inspector misses the crack, walks by the leak, & finally 
without pause someone sweeps & stuffs dozens of trash bags 
with glass & dead fish parts. We want what we want."
Faith,"For centuries, an order of Japanese monks 
chose one of the elders to deliver prayers 
to the island of an important Bodhisattva. They set 
the elect adrift in a shrine shaped like a coffin 
with a month of salted fish, rice crackers & water 
while brothers on shore kept watch for signs of panic. 
In many cases, the sacrifice tried to row home 
but the others turned him, shoved him back 
into the sea. A mirror of human existence: 
each of us sent to beg forgiveness from whichever 
gods we recognize while death patiently paces 
the sky. As darkness swallows the world, imagine
the cry of gulls, glimpses of a distant horizon, 
the slow groan of the casket atop the waves. "
The Bluebird,"A winged bit of Indian sky
Strayed hither from its home on high."
Hitch Hiker at a Truck Stop,"The hitch hiker asks to look at
the palms of my cold hands
and thanks me for unfolding them
on the frost-edged
picnic table between us.
While I look at his downcast eyes
trying to see if he sees,
nearby truckers stare
at his narrow face,
long blond hair.
He asks me if I garden,
rips a scrap of newspaper
and folds it up
into a tiny origami
package for anise seed.
Here, he says,
seed I gathered in Oregon,
plant it in Colorado.
I always have a garden, he adds,
I plant and leave to others.
He tells me he has no sex;
when you ride in the righthand seat,
you have to nod your head
without listening.
Face pressed to the window,
he can see the lacquered edges
of the earth.
So I imagine him 
practicing calligraphy
on truck windows,
recommending honey and vinegar
in a glass of water
every morning.
Mad, mad, mad.
A yellow warbler,
the moon at the bottom of the stream.
Out on the highway
he is raising his thumb again."
My Egypt,"Flaubert tells us he wore himself out
trying to imitate the cry of the camel,
rattle interrupted by a gargle;
he wanted to take it back with him
And Kuchak’s bedbugs fascinated him,
their smell mingled with the scent
of her skin. I want, he told her,
a touch of bitterness in things.
Temples, sand dunes, the very Nile itself
made him lazy, and he wrote home:
“I think of nothing at all,
not even the elevated thoughts
one should have here
in the presence of ruins!”
He sent his letter, then went off
to visit Kuchuk of the long legs
again, wondering what she felt
any pleasure since “undoubtedly”
her button had been circumcised
when she was a child.
I who have traveled to Egypt confess
I saw another country. In Cairo
a man followed me and I had to run;
a student in a packed bus rubbed his crotch
against me while I tried to twist away.
At night I couldn’t leave my cheap hotel.
I sat in my room reflecting on the touch
of bitterness in things."
Math Class,"Somehow that shriveled arm
seemed the perfect arm
for tracing the odd shapes of geometry
in white on our black chalkboard
showing us a woman could do
this unwomanly thing
and sometimes a girl would let out a giggle
almost like a pig squeak
and our teacher would stop, chalk
in her lifted hand
and her back would stiffen
as she turned and glared at us
then returned
to tracing out her mysteries
we girls thought
meant math is for old maids
dries women out
so they can’t want the only things
that seemed worth wanting—
happy grins in the hallways
and dark back seats where his warm breath
made the short hair on our napes stand up
and so we would come back to be scolded
and any boy in the class
knew better what any kind of triangle was
or how to add the sides up
into answers that were her kind
of “I do”
and some days she put the chalk
down on her desk
and told us how her father
scalded her with boiling water
and her arm contracted in its healing
but we barely listened
because a small white note was moving
across the room 
toward the last seat by the window
and she didn’t notice
since she was back at the blackboard
back at the numbers she loved
and we were girls
who knew nothing at all."
The Twins Visit a Farm,"The heavy black bulk of the draft horse
lay in the heat, circled by lime. Too huge
to bury, it was left for flies, night animals.
We walked around the gleaming hill
of its flanks, the nostrils tulip-blue,
tiny terrain of the pink gums,
belly mushrooming sweetness.
Too timid to touch this mystery
we were old enough to know
this was his final
beauty, this laying out
on meadow grass, beside aspen.
That very afternoon we had chased the Holsteins
home, their full udders sloshing
warm milk on us as they ran,
their gentle lowing a quiet happiness.
Elderberries and wild raspberries
had caught at our skirts
as we trotted toward the old farmhouse
where Mrs. Chesrown was scrubbing the milk buckets
in the hot sudsy water and the final light.
Sun glinting on a black coat:
twilight closing over earth,
a time of evening that pinches.
I glanced across at my pigtailed twin
as we re-entered the gate of the farmyard.
She had grown this summer and her knees
looked knobbier, her legs, gangly.
Her face said: You too, you too.
 "
A Great Beauty,"And when her son never returned
from the meant-to-crush-him camps,

the crucible of Poland,
always-hard-at-work Isa slept

for endless hours,
and once, under her lids, she was led,

by diligent female Virgils,
to a vast meadow

where an inspirited Isa embraced,
one by one,

countless women who remained
in mourning for their cherished sons.

Gallant and stricken,
together the myriad bereaved

but defiant women formed
an ever-widening circle,

prodigal with bitter tears,
and then, suddenly,

like a jackdaw darting
from eave to sun-drenched eave,

something flew between the throats
of the grieving,
heart-gutted mothers,
and a great beauty arose:

In the dream, Isa recalled,
the singing of the harrowed women

with war-taken sons
hushed the world’s barrenness.

In the dream, the startling river of sound
altered the embattled earth."
Jasmine,"These are the days of jasmine in Rome
when headlong, emboldened April has dissolved,

and the joyous braiding of sun and rain
brings this sweet, steady broadcast;

when I step from the suppertime train,
that’s what greets me:

Roman hedges and walkways,
graffiti-laden precincts graced

with pallid fireworks, so even
the most tumbledown niches seem

breeze-swept,
festive now with fragrance

Jasmine    the elating moment’s shibboleth,
the cool, enrapturing night’s cavalry

Even crone-glorious Daria,
my terrace-loving neighbor, confides:

When Galliano came back from the front,
his right hand was bandaged,

but in his injured one,
ah, poet, he held

a fistful of jasmine he’d picked
along the path to my door.

How could I not become his wife?"
The White Iris Beautifies Me,"Not the white of hard-won cotton,
or of pitiless snow—
I’ve found a whiteness
that gives me its glory;
it blooms
in Master Bellemare’s garden,
and though it is, by all accounts,
untouchable,
quiet as it’s kept, I’ve carried it
into the shabbiest of cabins,
worn it as I witnessed
the slave-breaker,
the hanging tree;
in dream-snatches
it blesses me, and I become
more than a brand,
a pretty chess piece:
at the mistress’s bell,
always prudent and afraid,
wily and afraid—
And when the day comes,
my rescuing flower’s name
will become my daughter’s;
a freeborn woman,
I swear,
she will never be shoeless
in January snow.
Bold Iris,
she will never fear sale
or the bottom of the sea."
Caesars and Dreamers,"The pharaohs of rice and indigo, the conniving
Caesars of cotton,
what were we to them?
Profitable: able
bodies from Barbados
and the Windward Coast,
the Rice Coast,
our souls ramshackle,
less than a rooster’s
or a rock’s.
And yet, in painstaking fields,
in joyous praise houses,
our tenacious “Go Down, Moses,”
our stirring, rallying
“In the beauty of the lilies
Christ was born across the sea . . .”
might have served as proof
to those zealous Southern despots
that we possessed
some quilt scrap of God.
Go tell those greed-swayed
kings of sugar, those implacable
princes of tobacco,
how we garnered freedom
in our hardscrabble dreams,
sang it as sweat-drenched,
unshakable hallelujah,
whispered it as healing salve
to allay the defiling
stripes on our backs.
Unstinting overseer,
iron-eyed Caesar,
who better to define freedom
than a slave?"
Notes in the Margin,"To find our Black history, 
search libraries and courthouses. 

There, relegated to slave records 
to property ledgers. Note: 

just below animals: mules, horses, and cows. 
Beneath objects: farm equipment and household goods. 

Witness even in this tight space
how we are not fastened to the page. 

Understand our ancestors’ feet did the talking. 
We’re lost in these vast erased spaces. 

Listen. 
Hear silenced voices and lives

Consult the field. 
Hear it say: I got more rest than they did. 

Blood cries out, so listen to the lynching tree. 
Ask why does it lean? Let the whipping post tell it. 

It speaks in tongues of slash and deep gash.
Smell the wounds turned to puss. Don’t turn your head. 

See Black backs calligraphed with grief and anger. 
Measure the distance between cabin and big house, 

but feel the canyon in between. 
See daytime and nighttime through cabin slats. 

Know cold and heat intimately. Hear bellies growl.
See chains or no chains but kept anyhow. 

What of their names? You get a price. Numbers. Profit. 
You might get a cook, a seamstress, a blacksmith, or a field hand. 

With a little luck and a little grace, you are blessed 
To find a relic to press to your dream memory upon. 

Conjure like a griot. Stir the pot. 
Keep it hot. 

Say enslaved not slave. What was done, 
was done unto us: shackle and chain. 

African proverb: until the lion writes
every story will glorify the hunter. 

Grow teeth and claw. Prey with Pen. 
Write in this vein. In this terror. 

In this glory. "
Deepest Pot,"Ise a maker of pots, 
bricks and poetry,

Dis ground don’t know you.

Soul Make a Path Through Shouting,"for Elizabeth Eckford
Little Rock, Arkansas, 1957
Thick at the schoolgate are the ones
Rage has twisted
Into minotaurs, harpies
Relentlessly swift;
So you must walk past the pincers,
The swaying horns,
Sister, sister,
Straight through the gusts
Of fear and fury,
Straight through;
Where are you going? 
I’m just going to school.
Here we go to meet
The hydra-headed day,
Here we go to meet
The maelstrom -
Can my voice be an angel-on-the-spot,
An Amen corner?
Can my voice take you there,
Gallant girl with a notebook,
Up, up from the shadows of gallows trees
To the other shore:
A globe bathed in light,
A chalkboard blooming with equations -
I have never seen the likes of you,
Pioneer in dark glasses:
You won’t show the mob your eyes,
But I know your gaze,
Steady-on-the-North-Star, burning -
With their jerry-rigged faith,
Their spear of the American flag,
How could they dare to believe
You’re someone sacred?:
Nigger, burr-headed girl,
Where are you going?
I’m just going to school.

Fallen Leaves,"An Indian Grandmother’s Parable
Many times in my life I have heard the white sages,
Who are learned in the knowledge and lore of past ages,
Speak of my people with pity, say, “Gone is their hour
Of dominion. By the strong wind of progress their power,
Like a rose past its brief time of blooming, lies shattered;
Like the leaves of the oak tree its people are scattered.”
This is the eighty-first autumn since I can remember.
Again fall the leaves, born in April and dead by December;
Riding the whimsied breeze, zigzagging and whirling,
Coming to earth at last and slowly upcurling,
Withered and sapless and brown, into discarded fragments,
Of what once was life; dry, chattering parchments
That crackle and rustle like old women’s laughter
When the merciless wind with swift feet coming after
Will drive them before him with unsparing lashes
’Til they are crumbled and crushed into forgotten ashes;
Crumbled and crushed, and piled deep in the gulches and hollows,
Soft bed for the yet softer snow that in winter fast follows
But when in the spring the light falling
Patter of raindrops persuading, insistently calling,
Wakens to life again forces that long months have slumbered,
There will come whispering movement, and green things unnumbered
Will pierce through the mould with their yellow-green, sun-searching fingers,
Fingers—or spear-tips, grown tall, will bud at another year’s breaking,
One day when the brooks, manumitted by sunshine, are making
Music like gold in the spring of some far generation. 
And up from the long-withered leaves, from the musty stagnation,
Life will climb high to the furthermost leaflets.
The bursting of catkins asunder with greed for the sunlight; the thirsting
Of twisted brown roots for earth-water; the gradual unfolding
Of brilliance and strength in the future, earth’s bosom is holding
Today in those scurrying leaves, soon to be crumpled and broken.
Let those who have ears hear my word and be still. I have spoken."
Jarring,"                          He of one leg
                     spins pots in chains. 
                 Writers dope deuces like 
              Give me silver or either Gold 
             though dangerous to our Soul
             On the twenty seventh of July
          One-thousand and eighteen forty
           a man stuck in red clay—never 
             a run-away except in his mind. 
                In Carolina he gave his jars
                 plenty of lip. They still run
                     they mouths every
                         which way for 
                               Dave. "
I love you. I miss you. Please get out of my house.,"Nothing today hasn’t happened before: 
I woke alone, bundled the old dog
into his early winter coat, watered him, 
fed him, left him to his cage for the day 
closing just now. My eye drifts 
to the buff belly of a hawk wheeling, 
as they do, in a late fall light that melts 
against the turning oak and smelts 
its leaves bronze. 
                             Before you left, 
I bent to my task, fixed in my mind
the slopes and planes of your face; 
fitted, in some essential geography,
your belly’s stretch and collapse 
against my own, your scent familiar 
as a thousand evenings. 
                                       Another time, 
I might have dismissed as hunger 
this cataloguing, this fitting, this fixing, 
but today I crest the hill, secure in the company 
of my longing. What binds us, stretches:
a tautness I’ve missed as a sapling, 
supple, misses the wind."
The Committee on Silence,"One morning when the sun erased all the night’s undoings, the villagers finally forgot how to close their eyes. They had grown tired of not seeing what all happened while they slept. They had grown tired of losing those fragile moments blinked away during each day’s dazzlement. That morning, no matter how hard the villagers tried, their eyelids would not budge. Even the softest fingers could not pinch closed any neighbor’s sight. They rejoiced. They would never miss the wolf approaching from the forest. They would never ignore the thief leaving the church with a sackful of eggs. They would never look past the child sticking chewed gum on a statue’s eye. They rejoiced and named the day Apollo Day. The Festival Committee was appointed. The Committee employed workers to saw down trees to be fashioned into spiral staircases leading far into the sky. The Committee hired labor to weave the surplus of exotic textiles into a quilt great enough to be cloaked around the entire village’s circumference. The Committee asked all the children to make with their hands a number of drawings to be nailed into each stair and stitched into every square of the fabric wall. When the moon next brightened its whole being, the festival was held. Music fled from mouths and instruments. Fire turned animals into food. Some people climbed into the night sky so far even eyes that could not close could not see them. Some people watched the wind move the wall like a single, continuous sheet of hymns. Some children hid and some children sought, but the children who were seeking always won. It was all anyone could speak of for the entire next year. The Committee decided on many agains. Festival after festival came and then went. After some time, the particulars gradually changed. Staircases were repaired, or replicas were made. The worn fabric was switched with nylon weave. Yet the children’s drawings remained largely the same. The elders saw in these sketches what they remembered seeing when they would blink. Instead of stories, each year’s festival ended with a sigh. The villagers continued their lives of light, speaking only of what they saw. The wolf approaching from the forest. The thief leaving the church with a sackful of eggs. The child sticking chewed gum on a statue’s eye. Sometimes what they saw they no longer wanted to see. A test was run, and village experts concluded everyone’s hearing had weakened. All signs pointed to it worsening. When someone spoke of a lake they once saw, the listener only heard a handful of silt. The experts decided there was nothing to be done. Year after year, the Committee continued to plan. One morning after the festival, when the sun lit the conquered dark, the villagers forgot how to open their ears. They had not planned for this. They named the day Harpocrates Day. No festival was to take place. They established the Committee on Silence. This brings us to the present day."
A Story about a Story about Death,"I am old. My grown daughter is helping me fall
asleep, telling me a story she once heard
as a little girl. My daughter is holding my hand
the way the ground holds a greedy shadow. The story
goes like this—a little girl’s father lived
to be a cottonwood. Every day, the girl read books
entangled in branches. Evenings, the moon
swam between leaves. Interrupting the story,
my grown daughter nods toward the dark
window. In it, a soft painting of a child
caring for a tree. That’s when I know
I’m asleep, pretending to be a white sheet
of paper. All around, June wind blows
the limbs’ whispers like familiar snow."
Fairy Tale,"The student writes a word, copse, quickly
realizing if the poem were read aloud, the listener
might assume the word is cops and become confused
because why would that small child in the poem
walk straight into an unlit murder of cops looking
for the owl she had been hearing all night, the owl
who had kept her from sinking into the lake
of sleep she had so badly wanted? Because
the student is talented, the student understands
thicket would also suffice, but those syllables
disagree with the poem’s neighboring sibilants
and circular vowels, so the student begins to feel
the first light of uncaring, an unfamiliar feeling, knowing
copse is more true than thicket, knowing that sound
allows a more important logic than sense. But class
raises its concern after the poem is read aloud
because the class feels compelled to police
sense in a way the student wishes to forget since
the student suddenly feels like the small child
looking in the dark for the owl who kept her
far from sleep, the owl whose ring-shaped offerings
may only be described in the act of voicing."
Meeting Mescalito at Oak Hill Cemetery,"Sixteen years old and crooked
with drug, time warped blissfully
as I sat alone on Oak Hill.
The cemetery stones were neither erect
nor stonelike, but looked soft and harmless;
thousands of them rippling the meadows
like overgrown daisies.
I picked apricots from the trees below
where the great peacocks roosted and nagged
loose the feathers from their tails.
I knelt to a lizard with my hands
on the earth, lifted him and held him
in my palm—Mescalito
was a true god.
Coming home that evening
nothing had changed. I covered Mama on the sofa
with a quilt I sewed myself, locked my bedroom
door against the stepfather, and gathered
the feathers I’d found that morning, each
green eye in a heaven of blue, a fistfull
of understanding; 
and late that night I tasted
the last of the sweet fruit, sucked the rich pit
and thought nothing of death."
Crow,"She started and shot from the pine,
then brilliantly settled in the west field
and sunned herself purple.
I saw myself: twig and rasp, dry
in breath and ammonia smelling.
Women taught me to clean
and then build my own house.
Before men came they whispered,
Know good polished oak. 
Learn hammer and Phillips.
Learn socket and rivet. I ran
over rocks and gravel they placed
by hand, leaving burly arguments
to fester the bedrooms. With my best jeans,
a twenty and a shepherd pup, I ran 
flushed and shadowed by no one
alone I settled stiff in mouth
with the words women gave me."
Cannery Town in August,"All night it humps the air.
Speechless, the steam rises
from the cannery columns. I hear
the night bird rave about work
or lunch, or sing the swing shift
home. I listen, while bodyless
uniforms and spinach specked shoes
drift in monochrome down the dark
moon-possessed streets. Women
who smell of whiskey and tomatoes,  
peach fuzz reddening their lips and eyes—
I imagine them not speaking, dumbed
by the can’s clamor and drop
to the trucks that wait, grunting
in their headlights below.
They spotlight those who walk
like a dream, with no one
waiting in the shadows
to palm them back to living."
The Miracle of Giving,"Twice Christ took the bread apart
with his human hands that he used for
such tasks, once with fish and once with wine,
the grain a pattern of tribute, distribute,
as he worked the division of himself into
feeding others with his body, taken but not taken,
there but not there, it was two times
two times two. Ever body got some body
who will feed them even when there seem hardly
enough to go round. When I hungered the word
fed me. Even so, so many others hungered
he needed a hundred more human hands.
That was when I said here take mine."
Frog,"Pocket pet of witches,  reincarnated child souls, most toxic augers of weather
&  superstitions—your   midnight  croaking means  rain’s  on the  way while  a
draught  of  pollywogs’s  a  cure-all  for  cancer,  consumption &  or weakness.
You taste somewhere  between mermaid & chicken,  you don’t dole warts nor
grant wishes.  In the original fairy tale it’s the maiden  pummeling you against
the wall turning you back into a prince & not her sovereign kisses. Mistake, as
Homer did,  Bufo for you &  open the doors  of astral vision.  God Almighty’s
been  sweeping  you  into cloud,  hailing you  down  upon roofs &  roads since
Heraclides.  Because yours is the  first species to die out  when your  habitat is
contaminated  you  are  earth   gauger,  poison  in  the  water’s  measure.  How
seldom  nowadays  a floating fleet  of ships is,  too few are  tempests of  blood,
crosses,   snakes   &   fishes;   our  end   times   reveal   themselves   as   nuclear

skin &  eat it.  I get it.  Like some megaton  explosion I too’ve  wanted to shed
self,  all leg  &  bleating  throat  &  reslicken  primogenial.  What  did  I  know

bump   your   salientian    ass   every   time   you    hopped   down    the   street"
Hoof,"—after Psalm 89, lines 26–35
Is it that I have had a richness 
of choices, have I gazelled 
sideways from one riverstone to the next?
         Or has this been a series 
         of false starts—
         the hoof withdrawn 
         at the slightest snow?
         January’s Wolf Moon calls her pups 
         into the night—marks 
their necessary kill. We all
need to eat
even in snow—hoof paused 
over the water—my heart says

My Poisonous Cousin the Pipevine Swallowtail,"come again in summer, larvae ravening the bitter vine

The Arid Land,"There will be willows plunging
Their bloodless roots in air
And the hard crooked flying
Of buzzards circled there.
About the treeless wastes
No sand may ever heap
With water, nothing will run
And nothing creep.
Arid, desolate, defiant
Under its iron band
Of sky, we yet may love
This so sunny land."
Pinyan,"The plod of the trespassers
              on wet turf,
in the sinking dark,
              marked their path,
plan, toward the barn
              where it slept—
the stallion, resting
              from its thoroughbred
charge, hungry for oats,
              hay
-nested, silent
              save the hot breath
of its nostrils.
With night as protector,
              the men did steal
into the animal’s stall—
              craving its smell
and cozy parameter,
              the better to bind
their shame and lustful
              intention toward beast,
equine
              —its shape,
mythic tether to man,
              the centaur’s nobility
and speed, stride.
Perhaps, it was unbridled
              envy of nature
unbridled or the desire
              to be subdued raw
and primitively too,
              that led one—having
been broken
              early and practiced—
to seek consolation
              in this mating, of sorts:
the dumb and biological
              thrusts of the teased
phallus, the spewing
              and satisfaction,
all animal, really;
              the win-win grace
of it—the horse
              both horse and rider."
Offa’s Legacy,"Empire dwindled to tetrarchy, reliant, as an exotic concubine,
     on foreign common wealth. The roads rampant with
     painted men, too—the whole kingdom the brunt of
     Lundenwic’s folly.

The sovereign silent and ceremonious, though powers rise
     at the choosing of the Garter, dazzles the opening
     of Parliament in borrowed jewels.

I fed the son of Offa Rex, a staggeringly-gifted child, the food
     of slaves and his belly had never been so full."
Muse,"So you’ve come back
to me, again, at last,
to leave—walked me this far
through crowds to say that, here,
you must turn a corner,
distance yourself,
throw this fiction of us on the pyre;
with a smirk on your face,
watch it burn—eyes in awe
as a patron of torture;
you, who would be most constant
when the caucuses of early hour
begin to bicker in the brain:
what word to hold you in place
beneath this captive’s power
or persuade a part of you
to concede itself to savior,
to haul this burden into some other life?"
Goliath,"When I asked Saul for a warrior, I had no idea it would be you.
I underestimated your anger in the marketplace. I scorned you
because you were beautiful and softer than the whores of Gath,
a look from which I could not turn or face. I scorned you
as Ishbi-benob watched, my brother with his lack of judgment,
and all the others who haunt that space. I scorned you
after a week of battles, the steady beat of marching and shrill
ram’s horn in my ear. Since I could not chase, I scorned you.
Long has Orpah told tales of the sons of Israel, with flashing
eyes and a stealth no one can trace. I scorned you
because you made me weak in the presence of my troops,
reduced a great soldier to an old man’s pace. I scorned you
when you rattled me in the Valley of Elah. Even when the
stones began to fly, the enduring disgrace, I scorned you."
As if the World Were Missing a Blue Window,"Translated from the Arabic by Robyn Creswell
Nothing will happen but nothing will stay the same. Before 
the end of the year, you’ll cross the sea and I'll cross the ocean
to meet in a city located at a seemly distance from each of our
homes. You'll translate some stories about sorcerres and 
demons to buy the ticket, I'll invent a transparent lie to leave 
Christmas dinner warm on the table and not miss my plane. 
   My body reposes atop the clouds. I'll remember each one 
on my way to you, since it won’t be there for the return
flight. The rain that rises now as steam from the waters will 
become water again. It's not by accident that I spend my flight
reading The Museum of Innocence. This won't make Pamuk
happy, though it might make the museum's founder feel less 
meloncholy. 
   All just to be here in a carpet store, about to buy the one 
full of defects for our shared room. We don’t lie to the old rug
merchant: We’re both from Egypt and despite geography, 
despite the separate paths our lives have taken, we're here, together. 
                                                              * 

We exchange gifts that couldn't be sent by mail: a bracelet for 
a ring, The Tobacco Keeper for The World Doesn’t End. We drill 
a peephole in the wall that separates us. 
—You sleep a lot, sweetie, and never in my life have I seen 
someone drink coffee with Coca-Cola. 
—You have an intimate relationship with your toothbrush, 
my love, and I've never met someone who had such raspy 
lungs that she forgets to breathe when she laughs. 
    —You went back to Egypt at the right time. 
    —You left Egypt at the right time. 
  You buy my son a piece of agate, I buy your mother a kohl
jar. On the way home, each of us thinks, I wonder what the 
right time is? 

                                                             *

Each of us goes home. Kisses on the neck, scratch marks on 
the back. Scents in the skin, pain beneath. 
    That’s how we planned a crime that would hurt no one but 
ourselves. You have manuscripts to edit, while I go back to 
roost atop my silence. The streets of Cairo are still crowded—
just open the window. But I can’t believe the mountains are 
where they used to be. For me, the closest place at a safe dist-
from this desolation is death. 

                                                               *

Impossible for me to see you in a city with no walls: here the 
winds moan beyond the city gates, unable to enter. A walled 
city—both of us need a prison to notice the birds flying above
it. It depressed me to think they were seagulls. How could 
such wings belong to egg thieves? It depressed you to think 
they were seagulls. How could these symbolic creatures, the 
subjects of poets’ songs, feed on garbage? 

                                                               *
You search for love, then don’t know what to do with it. Hand 
clutches hand, then fears what it holds will never let go. The
ear gets used to one voice, which quickly becomes insuffer-
able. It’s like I'm peering into the darkness of the womb, look-
ing for the lucky little egg, clinging like her to the side of the 
wall, waiting together for the moment of maturity and free-
dome, warmth and fulfillment, embodiment and creation, un-
sure whether life truly needs another child or not. 
    Love: again. Magnificent delusion we bring to life and then 
try to control. 

                                                               *

I’m intoxicated, you’re infatuated                        so who will take us home? 

    An open question, like a wound—a question we call exis-
tential. But it’s the taxi driver who will take us back to the
hotel. And so we disappoint the ancient poet with our facile 
answers. 

                                                               *

Like a little hole dug by settlers to torture local rebels, as ter-
rifying as a deep well . . . The will to crime crumbles at the 
thought of punishment; victims’ souls circle the dim light. 
Bats crash against the walls of memory. Having escaped the
bottle, the jinn don’t know what to do. 

He and I
I’ll say to myself someday: 
We were there as hostages
to a desire that felt like despair. 
I put my emigration and his estrangement
on the golden scales
and suddenly we were rich. 
Each of us tried to overpower the other, 
looking for a freedom we had no reason to expect. 
We were wise enough to renounce our self-absorption
   and go back
to our roles as upstanding citizens in a modern society, 
leaving our two beautiful bodies in that little hole. 
It couldn’t possibly have been a hotel room. 

                                                               *

Dawn is when the heart gets pulled in two directions. The 
sun hasn’t yet opened her eyes, the moon hasn’t yet gone to 
bed. . . 
   No dew gathers on the argan tree, which survives even the 
longest droughts. 
   I feel the desire to pray. I don’t know whom to address. "
Raising a Glass with an Arab Nationalist,"Translated from the Arabic by Robyn Creswell
The pianist was still droopy-eyed, her face as dark as the keys they left her to press for half a century, though she must have been white as an angel when they first strung her up in the heavy frame on the wall.
     Here amid the sighs of Umm Kalthum and the local wine of uncertain vintage, I thought my courage might come through that door next to the bar. While the garçon read his tabloid, and I slid among my options like drop of dew on a bunch of grapes, an Arab nationalist made an entrance, his hair all white as if he’d just been fighting off an invasion of the midan down the street.
     “The nation is on fire,” he said, instead of good evening, and I started coughing from the smoke that suddenly engulfed me.
    Intermittent barks from outside covered the sounds of sighing inside. The garçon would turn up the volume a notch for the Nightingale of the East, but the bitch’s howling won the battle. Soon she’d give birth to a couple of pups at least around the back of the building.
    The garçon should really stop the 1943 Rivoli record. Zakarriya Ahmad wouldn’t like this medley of oud, dog barks, and coughing under a colonial-era roof.
    I’d come back from a funeral that afternoon. A surgeon, just out of school, was waiting for me in a room he’d spent too much time tidying up.
     But my courage never came through the door—the sordid side door that separates the women’s room from the men’s urinal."
A Grave I’m about To Dig,"translated from the Arabic by Robyn Creswell

    As I return home with a dead bird in my hand, a little grave
I’m about to dig waits for us in the backyard. 
    No blood on the washed feathers, two outspread wings, 
and a dewdrop (some concentrate of spirit?) on its beak, as if 
it had flown for many days while actually dead. 
    Its fall was fated in the Lord’s eyes, heavy and diagonal in 
front of mine. 
    I’m the one who left my country back there to go for a walk 
in this forest, holding a dead bird whose absence the flock
never noticed, 
    returning home for a funeral that might have been a solemn 
one were it not for the sneakers on my feet. "

Sippokni Sia,"I am old, Sippokni sia.
Before my eyes run many years,
Like panting runners in a race.
Like a weary runner, the years lag;
Eyes grow dim, blind with wood smoke;
A handkerchief binds my head,
For I am old. Sippokni sia.
Hands, once quick to weave and spin;
Strong to fan the tanchi;
Fingers patient to shape dirt bowls;
Loving to sew hunting shirt;
Now, like oak twigs twisted.
I sit and rock my grandson.
I am old. Sippokni sia.
Feet swift as wind o’er young cane shoots;
Like stirring leaves in ta falla dance;
Slim like rabbits in leather shoes;
Now moves like winter snows,
Like melting snows on the Cavanaugh.
In the door I sit, my feet in spring water.
I am old. Sippokni sia.
Black like crow’s feather, my hair.
Long and straight like hanging rope;
My people proud and young.
Now like hickory ashes in my hair,
Like ashes of old camp fire in rain.
Much civilization bow my people;
Sorrow, grief and trouble sit like blackbirds on fence.
I am old. Sippokni sia hoke."
Cold War,"If you can remember the cold war, you’re too old for me.
       —Grindr profile
Because you’re twenty-two, and in your prime,
you silently refuse to date, or “date.”
When war was cold, I had a lovely time.
I messaged you and sent a shot of grime,
then shot some more. It must have been too late.
Because you’re twenty-two, and in your prime?
Perhaps. I’m shifting like a paradigm.
And all the new assumptions formulate
as if our war were cold. A lovely time:
I’ll exercise my stock, internal rhyme—
the currency is yours to circulate.
I’m forty-nine; my interest rate is prime.
Suppose that poverty is not a crime.
Suppose you more or less accommodate,
like war. When cold, we’ll have a lovely time.
Perhaps you’ll click on me in wintertime.
Proximity is constant; so is fate.
Was I twenty-two? Before my prime
the war was cold. I had a lovely time."
Thirteen Ways of Looking,"after David Hammons’s Close Your Eyes and See Black
1. Smear your forearms with something like shea butter or sunscreen and lean over a bright piece of paperboard, facedown. Hover there, then print your body onto to the paper below. See how your forearms, printed there, make the top half of a diamond?

2. There is no clear narrative. What is clear, scanning the artwork from top to bottom, are details of a naked, muscular torso: two nipples, a hairy chest in the shape of a heart, the elastic band and wrinkled beginnings of a pair of trousers—and strikingly, within the torso, the portrait of a face—cupped by two hands.

3. Close your eyes and see black.

4. What is the texture and mood of your blackness? What seeking, sweetness, or sorrows does it hold?

5. Then the bottom edge of the frame.

6. In Close Your Eyes and See Black, the white space is not white. It is golden, a deep royal hue. Everywhere the body print isn’t is the color of a peeled Georgia peach.

7. Place your hands over your head and make the shape of a diamond.

8. Back to the portrait of a face. It appears like a ghost: centered in the torso, centered in the lower half of the frame. It appears beneath the nipples and above the elastic of wrinkled pants. It appears to be a photographic image of a Black man. It appears this man is closing his eyes, is seeing black.

9. What blacknesses do you see? What blacknesses have printed themselves onto you?

10. To make this body print, David Hammons coated his hair, skin, and clothes with grease and pressed his body onto the paperboard. Then the artist dusted a dark pigment on top, which adhered to the grease’s stickiness.

11. There is no face in the top half of the art work. Instead, a negative space, a rich, golden hue breathes into the space of the diamond.

12. The color of a lucky, double-yolk egg.

13. What must it feel like to shine in shadow; to glow darkly in the sun?"
If They Come in the Morning,"after Kerry James Marshall’s Black Painting and after Fred Hampton

In the after of the painting’s scene 
sun slices, shoots through 
the room—but the now-painting
remains dark. In the days after, 
hundreds will tour the bloodshot 
house, I mean it was like 
what Mamie Till said: Leave 
the casket open, I need you to see 
what they did to my son. I can barely 
make out the painting’s two figures—remember
there are three: Akua is nine months pregnant 
next to Fred. I mean the police came 
so early morning resembled night, 
they shot through the mattress and killed 
and killed—Fred died and died.
The bed heavy with two bodies—one 
body heavy with a third, I’m asking you 
to remember. Three asleep at 4:30am. 
In the now-painting Fred’s body is hard 
to make out and alive. Soon he will be 
murdered. My eyes can barely decipher 
the two—remember three—draped 
in brushes of black paint. I am close now
to the painting, as close as catastrophe,
as close as mourning barreling into night."
Trans Study: Untitled 4 (Facial Expression),"Upon first glance, it is difficult to decipher a figure, much less a facial expression. Upon first glance, it is difficult, the figure. Upon first glance, there is no face. Upon first, undecipherable, the glance. It is difficult. It depends on who is looking. We might say: Upon first glance, we are in a dark room. We are behind our eyelids in the room. We are looking, in the dark. The figure before us is also behind the eyelids, their eyelids. It is as if neither we nor they are present to the other, though we are, looking, together, in and from the dark. We look to work out the other’s intentions. We cannot. We look. We breathe together inside the room inside. The figure, having been exposed, overexposed, to light has become like a shadow or a barely lit shape on the midnight lake. For the sake of simplicity, we could call the figure a man, but I will not. We are in the room that precedes all that. The cleavage of this from that. It goes: first darkness, then form. Remember that. Try. If we look too long at the lake what surfaces is the old thought—when I was a child, when I was a child—we are thrown back to before, not shame, but shame of shame. We become furious and wild-limbed and kind. We pass the clause between us, a rope tethering, tethering, taut. A poem, we’ve been taught, though we can’t say where, should leave this part out. We should rush from room to bright room so that we can be surprised by what we find. But the figure is still in the dark. They require our stillness. Our black breath. I am afraid, I say to no one, to be like this image. Upon first glance, unreachable. Exposed. When I was a child, there was a figure in the dark. A man. Let’s call him that. A man. I was a question. I was a question he answered. I was a question he held and demanded my stillness. Part of me lives in that room, still, though I left it with a new, wretched name. But—and I can say this now—he saw me, the man in the dark, when no one else could see me. When I was, in manner of speaking, difficult to decipher. A darkness before form. He held me. Stilled me. He brought me into the frame. We were two black men there, in the black, the close black, the black from which life, relentlessly, comes. The breath between us was cruel. But I could see him. Him. I could see the sorrow, the rage, the calm water, the father raising his fist, the unnamable quiet of his face."
Galleria Ode,"Something there is that doesn’t love the mall
where we used to chainsmoke on the mezzanine
 
and watch the escalator’s endless crawl
up from Häagen-Dazs to Chuck E. Cheese—
 
something so embarrassed by it all, it shatters glass 
and scatters yellow lading slips among the weeds,

and strips whole runs of copper from the walls
of what was once a Limited, a County Seat—

their slender mannequins spray-painted now
with cartoon boobs and cocks, unseen
 
until the new kids come to flash their phones
inside the ancient ruins of the Regal 6—

where webless, clueless, on our own,
we used to hold hands in the dark and kiss."
The Opposite of Abandonment, 
Injury Room,"Through my
little window, I
see one day
the entire bird, 
the next just 
a leeward wing, 
the next
only a painful
call, which, without
the body, makes
beautiful attachments
by even
attaching at
all."
"Saturday, April 17, 2010 12:49 am","translated by Ilana Luna and Cheyla Samuelson
Water on water: the tone and the timbre. Impossible to describe the deep empty longing in the voice of birds. This childhood happened elsewhere. The light, as thin as a thread through the eye of the astral needle. Lyme Regis is a town on the coast. The howling of the wind. The taste of salt on the lips, on the neck, right on the tip of the nose. There’s a green that can only be perceived in dreams. There’s no echo without a wall, in effect. Then the girl turned to look at me: you still don’t remember this moment? she asked. Or said. In time I grew expert in wrapping myself up in a black cloak. Someone would sing on the other side of the world; someone else would raise their hand or their voice or their gaze. As far as I know Meryl Streep was never a redhead. Turning corners: the body that departs. Tolling bells: the body that will never return. But how white the foam on the crest of the waves looks! I’ll forget it, I had to admit. The accent marks the longest separation. Skimming: two words that fly over bodies of water, the ocean. What? she asked again. Stupefied is a spectacular adjective. Nobody abandoned you, I had to yell each word for her to hear me. The echo: the wall: the effect. Understanding is just as likely as misunderstanding. A body huddled between clouds. A corner. The voices travel over extremely long distances. The childhood that’s watching me. This sky.

  Agua contra agua: el tono y el timbre. Imposible describir la honda vacía añoranza en la voz de los pájaros. Esta infancia ocurrió en otro lugar. La luz, tan delgada como un hilo a través del ojo de la aguja estelar. Lyme Regis es un pueblo en una costa. El ulular del viento. El sabor a sal sobre los labios, en el cuello, justo en la punta de la nariz. Existe un verde que sólo es posible percibir en sueños. No hay eco sin pared, en efecto. Entonces la niña se volvió a verme: ¿todavía no recuerdas este momento?, preguntó. O dijo. Con el tiempo me hice experta en arroparme con una capa negra. Alguien cantaría en el otro extremo del mundo; alguien más elevaría la mano o la voz o la mirada. Que yo sepa Meryl Streep nunca fue pelirroja. Doblar las esquinas: el cuerpo que se va. Doblar las campanas: el cuerpo que no regresará. ¡Pero qué blanca luce la espuma en la cresta de las olas! Lo olvidaré, tuve que admitirlo. El acento sella la separación más larga. Al ras: dos palabras que sobrevuelan las aguas, el océano. ¿Qué?, volvió a preguntar. Atolondrado es un adjetivo espectacular. Nadie te abandonó, tuve que gritar cada palabra para que me oyera. El eco: la pared: el efecto. Entender es tan posible como malentender. Un cuerpo agazapado entre nube y nube. Una esquina. Las voces viajan distancias muy largas. La infancia que me ve. Este cielo."

In a Disused Graveyard,"The living come with grassy tread
To read the gravestones on the hill;
The graveyard draws the living still,
But never any more the dead.
The verses in it say and say:
“The ones who living come today
To read the stones and go away
Tomorrow dead will come to stay.”
So sure of death the marbles rhyme,
Yet can’t help marking all the time
How no one dead will seem to come.
What is it men are shrinking from?
It would be easy to be clever
And tell the stones: Men hate to die
And have stopped dying now forever.
I think they would believe the lie."

Until the end of time, here  
stands the manzana trees we gardened 
& bloomed.  
The trees are dying from drought 
because it hadn’t been fed.  
Red shrivel red. 
Green losing green.  
Maybe if I repeat Lorca will still this grief.  
No hands like yours could touch the soil 
& bring the rain. Sing to plants, my, I still  
can hear your voice like violet.
Sing to my garden,  
dying.

An Erasure of Senate Bill 1698 (2), 
Grow,"I have a red onion in a green bowl on my kitchen counter
sprouting a green stalk that began as a little green haystack
bump, a knobby cyst, really, that broke surface, felt like what
I imagine I’m feeling for when I rub my breasts in the shower,
my eyes closed as if water is a blindfold allowing me to feel
within that dark any small homicide growing within me. I can’t
bring myself to use the onion, to gnash its skin, to whack off
its hard-on-gooseneck like I’m suddenly death’s
scythe, death’s brindled pet, death’s dappled good-girl. Maybe,
the onion believes in something, imagines itself still wild,
or holds in its layers the delusion of lilacs or iris or
goldenrod or blueberry or some other rambling growth
redacting my sense of abandon, here, in this too-large house,
a-lone-ly, not like a battle with silence way-of-alone-ness but
a passage. Quiet. Sometimes bright, sometimes dim, so, foreign. 
I am a theft waiting to happen, a rotten spell visioning
the onion’s end. Salt. Oil. Softly seared particulate
endings. Oh, onion, circular cycle, joy-halo. Grow."
ER S/P GSW,"A colleague tells me of her ER patient,
status-post gunshot to the chest.
How hyperdynamic the heart was,
though a thick, loculated clot
amassed in the pericardial casing.
How the patient pointed to the pain:
red wound, fifth intercostal space.
It was starlike, the small, reflective slug
crouched in its own echolucent shine.
He was alone on the gurney and without
family, the young man who refused police
a description of the car that fired and sped away.
As if to protect someone. As if his shooter
were more a community than the police
our country fashioned of itself. Deindustrialized.
Segmented. Unconscious by an unlit home
with barred windows and hand-written sign
that read “daycare.” No exit. Reverberation
artifact. Neon, auto-bodied sky.
Akinetic on glass-strewn sidewalks, amen.

A number of insects are placed in a clear container so that they are as comfortable as possible, given the circumstances. They are given oxygen and food and water, though they may not escape. The container of insects is placed on stage and a light is directed through the container and projected onto a large screen so that the audience may see the insects.
Each musician chooses an insect, and plays accordingly.
If two insects begin fighting, the corresponding musicians should also fight, musically or literally.
If an insect dies, the corresponding musician should also die, musically or literally."

Ant as a glass of water,"They ask and I say no because I figure they are unlikely to accept my answer anyway but they insist on an answer so I say fine, I’ll tell you. I’ll tell you that when I grow very old I would like to become a glass of water. No no you must continue to be human. See, I told you I didn’t want to answer. No, please. You must continue to be human. But why. Because you are one now. All the more in my old age I would like to be a glass of water, I’d make such a nice glass of water, don’t you think? So useful, so desired. No no you cannot be a glass of water. Fine then I’ll be an ant. No you cannot be an ant. For the same reasons, I imagine. Yes. Please. Do continue to be human. But why won’t you even give me a chance. In fact, screw that—I’ll be an ant, and that ant will be a glass of water. I do not understand what you mean. Here’s what you can do with my old age. Swirl it first, to release the aroma. I am a well-tempered ant, a nicely adjusted glass of water. Breathe it in, my molecules of ant scent. Tip it to the left, to the right, watch the contents swish to the head, to the tail, and back again to the head. Contemplate my black translucency, the sleek curve of exoskeleton that fits nicely in your hand, and imagine how nourishing, this universal elixir of ant. Daily, every day, forever, moreover. I am delighted to age so beautifully into this ant, this glass of water. I am grateful. I am joyful. I am overflowing with vigorous survival. Thank you, ant. Thank you, water. Our relationship is both banal and extraordinary. I am an ant. I am a glass of water. Plus ça change. Same as it ever was. The question is no longer to drink or not to drink. The wind outside is punishing, and yet look at you now, holding me so tenderly. I knew it would be easier than you could ever know, to age so nicely into this ant that is a glass of water. It is what it is, as they say into their covered mouths."
11.16.2003,"The pain of seeing something beautiful.
Is layered as such, the first layer of it being thick, of substance, I can’t say which sort, but of being matter and matterful, or rather, a person for whom I have spent a great deal of time and love, and this layer would be this very time and love, in whatever physical form it may take shape.
Then there are many layers of something else, everything else, the world, for example, or more likely simply a space of time or geography or perhaps a curtain or a collared shirt or a person or several, various degrees of people and objects.
The last layer is the something beautiful, which lays itself down quietly on top of all these layers, none of which were waiting for this to happen, except that only by the happenstance of the arrival of this layer are the other layers actualized as such; a distance, a thickness, a slightly twitching texture is created between the first and last layers, a measurable distance that surfaces out of nowhere but an internal and external longing for a presence or good word."
I Am Not Trying to Hide My Hungers from the World Anymore,"Not trying to wipe the smears
of gold from my chin
not trying to erase the decadence
of seeds and profanity  
of grease not trying
to pretend I don’t open
my mouth around the zaftig
pearls of rain in the middle
of the night or that I don’t love
the moment right before sleep
when I am most tender
and translucent my bladder half-filled
knowing I will have to get up
and pee knowing my daughter
will wake up before I am ready
the way I became aware of her
on a climb through the mountains
a heaviness in my limbs a gentle
premonition as I walked later
to the Rite Aid and knew in my hands
and I knew in my mouth
and I knew in the way my body
pulled me forward as I wept
with joy but also grief
that a part of my life was ending
and isn’t it good to know when
life is about to swallow you whole
take you in its arms and say
“Live, bitch, live”
and you believe it
and this is how I will carry her
from her crib and open the curtains
partway not ready to let the
world in the trails of smoke
and exhaust winter-blue 
as Cat Stevens’ Mona Bone Jakon
spinning on the Crosley  
that opens like an old suitcase
when my daughter stands
on a chair lifting the stylus
from its perch guiding
it to the starry chatter
that hisses between songs
wondering what will play next"
Why in Some Hospitals They Don’t Let You Hold Hands During Labor,"Consider the perineum  
stretched like cheap nylons
each night, two fingers 
then three dipped in oil  
opening the taint’s
buttery seam. Consider
the bloody asterisk
of mucus plug,
amniotic sac
that refused to break
until I unhooked 
from the saline drip
and danced until I pissed
myself, urine streaming pink
down my legs. Consider 
the wedding band
my husband removed
before I crushed
his hand at ten centimeters,
bit his knuckle as if excavating
myself from a wreck;
excrement and buckets of ice, 
the mirror someone placed 
between my legs until I understood 
I didn’t need it, closed my eyes
and orchestrated my own
resurrection, cupping the dark
oil of my daughter’s hair
as she emerged. Yes, I would have 
pulled my husband into the abyss with me,
tearing open in every direction 
like a star. I would have cracked 
his carpals like a piano’s brittle keys
like snapping the neck of a dove.
I would have burned the whole place down
to get where I needed to go."
I Pump Milk Like a Boss,"I pump milk on the side of the road where the grass is biblical green
as if first cousin to the cow, her pink and swollen tits immaculate
as the plumbing of a church organ sending up calls to god, brassy mesh                                
of notes, fermented and dank as kush. I pump milk with my bare hands
into a bar’s bathroom sink, above which is a mirror where someone’s scrawled
I Love Cricket Pussy and below that, Everyone Deserves to be Loved.
I look at myself under the fingered smudge, the bodily fluids spattered
like haikus and I pump as if my milk is propaganda,
fingers bowing across my chest like a pawnshop violin,
milky graffiti tagging the spit-clogged drain.
I pump like I’m writing my name in blood
which turns to the milk my child sucks dry, which she turns into blood.
I pump like I have a tattoo on my pudenda
that says Aerosmith backwards, I pump
as if my hands have teeth, one combat boot hitched up on the toilet seat,
each hiss of milk chanting like a choir yes bitch yes,
my tits bitten and salt-veined, as when my baby
took her first gulp of air, humming   
from the engorged crevasse of me
like a herd of wildebeest, as if the hive of me could have burst,
the infrared honey, the glop glop
of afterbirth dripping down my left leg,
spittle and amen, amniotic residue   
fluorescent with prayer—
Do men lactate is a popular google search and I wonder
what would happen if they could, our presidents
lifting their offspring to their breasts in the deep pockets
of night, listening to the dribble of milk
sipped from the pulpit of their bodies. Tonight my breasts
became so engorged I said I’d pay someone to suck my tits
half-joking. But a woman who heard followed me to the bathroom, read me
a sex poem while I pumped my milk, leaning away from the need in her voice
and the milk came slow and I pumped and waited for her to finish
and a streetlight scribbled in the parking lot
and I know there is a price we pay for loneliness
and a price we pay to forget it and I dedicate my libido
to my younger self and this is how I want to live, milk-stained, a little bit emptied,
a little bit in love with the abundance of my body,
my milk pale yellow with a layer of cream
which I will save long after it’s turned, praising its curdled glow
every time I open the fridge, as if its presence is enough to keep me safe,
as if it’s enough to make me invincible."
Immigration,"So what if I don’t love you.
My problems don’t even happen to me
But to three girls grandstanding by the Potomac.
Respectively: your mother, her mother and her mother.
Three bitches in front of a trashcan.
Desirous of psychotherapy and a split lip courtesy of me.
Because I didn’t ask to be born here.
Didn’t ask to learn the language.
And don’t know how to save you.
Am I frightening you?
I’m frightening you.
Good and good and good and good."
Dunes,"When I finally reached them, a young father 
was trying to teach his daughter how to cast. 
She flicked her wrist, overshot, found the motion 
the second time around. I’d run four miles 
to get here & didn’t think I’d make it, then sat 
awhile attempting to be still, to regard the teenagers 
stripping down to their suits with recognition, 
kindness, & not my usual judgment aimed inward. 
Yesterday, an ecologist was explaining how 
so much in nature forms from loss—take beaches, 
he’d said, damage the desired state for a certain 
kind of growth. On the walk home my feet hurt, 
I came across a turtle in the road, flies attaching 
to its split shell, & waited for someone else 
to move it. Like how she’d told me I needed 
to open, but how? I mean it literally: I can’t figure 
out the mechanics. Online another poet vows 
not to collude anymore with modes of despair. 
But what about the opposite, what it would mean 
to shelter despair like a child or childhood pet? 
This is me trying to make an opening. For some-
thing unformed to enter. A new kind of noticing. 
The willingness to risk failure for the possibility
of love. On the dunes, a dark-haired woman walking 
barefoot along the shoreline smiled as she passed. 
I smiled back. Farther out now, the teenagers 
splashed in the waves, & as I listened to the pitch 
of their voices could tell they weren’t teenagers 
at all but somewhere in the middle of their lives."
No One’s Looking,"Lately waking at an indeterminate hour, 
I know no one’s looking for me. 

I could walk across a bridge & back
or burrow in, king of my oscillating 

fan. Minutes sag like low branches 
in snow. I’m taking my adulthood slow, 

like medicine. Arranging flowers in a vase 
is something nice to do for yourself, 

that color rush, serotonin spike, even if 
they won’t survive the week. The cut stems 

stripped of function, the smaller griefs
in that. Like how my niece at night stands 
in her crib refusing sleep, eyelids fluttering
open, closed. Soon, all the world’s 

nieces will be old enough to want another 
earth, a second chance, as we warm 

by degrees. We’re at a boil now, over-
flowing with want. These are trying times. 

But time’s trying, asking us to stay awhile
longer inside the length of this moment."
Once I Was in Love,"with all my friends     & sometimes still am     
even though you can’t say that out loud 
except in a karaoke song     at a dive bar on the LES

I hate to swim but love the ocean   
all that artificial       blue for miles    
I miss my mother (who isn’t dead) & always will       

her illegible cursive on my refrigerator door  
when we go shopping       she sits in the fitting room 
while I try on bras & dresses for a wedding

I’m thirty-four & live alone     I don’t know 
the number of any doctor       who will I call in a winter 
without her     I will never pick up the phone"
This Is My Heart For You,"1.
First: Rain on the mountain, marching over the mountain
like straight-down ghosts made real once they pinprick
the surface of the water. A distant thunder
that could be mistaken for the blasting
they are doing over yonder where another
mountain is being hauled out one piece at a time.
            You can see an entire entity passing beneath
            your feet if you pause on the bridge above the tracks.
But here, on this bridge, Troublesome churns underneath
us, brown and foamy. All the other little
creeks have ganged up and poured off the cliffs and hillsides
to their great way out, good old Troublesome
O Troublesome O Troublesome O good old creek.
2.
Turn on the faucet next morning and out comes
the water orange, the color of earth
that gets trapped way way down in the metallic
rocky canals that hide within the clefts
of mountains. O secret secret O holy
holy these places are, little hidden
spaces only known by God. We are a people
used to our water being tainted for don’t we
live in just such a world every determined
day of our lives when our mothers are telling
us we are not like them and our fathers
are yelling and waving pistols and all the world
says no, you are wrong wrong wrong very wrong.
But here, on Troublesome, we are of one mind,
of one family and perhaps the creek
is our mother, maybe the mountain is
our mother. The black gum and sycamores
they comfort us, the red fox who comes out during
the sermon is our kin. Lord Lord Lord
what lurks among the gloaming’s cedars,
watching us as we go about our busyness?
The wise old woodlanders sit back and they are pleased,
amused by our honesty that knows
no bounds here yet is tucked away in a little
box made of leaves when we are in the places
we call our homes but are not, really.
Otherwise we would not love this haunted place so much.
3.
Do Lord O Do Lord O Do remember me
the woman sings and we do we do we remember
remember remember. We are all memory
and remembering. This is my heart for you.
We are holding on with white knuckles and we mourn
for what we have not been able to clutch, we mourn
it and preserve it and make it into poems
and songs and books and jars of pickled corn
we can sit on the window sill to catch the light.
You cannot put back a mountain but you can
carry its stories strapped to your back like medicine
bundles, you can make a tattoo of them
on the underside of your arm. You can sew them
onto the unseen parts of your mouth This is my
hand for you, outstretched, unfolded, unclenched—
everything but uncertain. Read them
the way the wise old-timers read the leaves
and the skies and wooly-worms. Read them and tell me
what you see in our past, in our creek,
on the side of our mountain. There is language
in the kudzu and it is all ours and belongs
to no one else. This is my tongue for you,
whispering our history: words words words.
4.
All week long the rain came and went, as did the stories.
Sometimes all would be as still as the voices
of sleeping birds, the leaves breathing against
the wooden shingles of the chapel, the graves
all wet and mossy. Not many mornings
were the spiders able to build their webs
in the corners of the bridge for the rains washed
them away. But always there were the words
and the songs and a thousand different kinds
of joys and griefs. All the while the people were singing
and the creek was running and the mountains
were breathing their last breaths and the kudzu was growing,
just waiting for the moment when it would overtake
every little bit of it, but the people
there cherished it anyway for it was their symbol,
the kudzu. Kudzu, kudzu, a word they sang
and claimed like their own although it came across the sea,
just like them, just like the vine itself. All
things that take up residence must first travel
and find their own secret places in the waiting world."
Cumberland Falls,"O, let them be…
Gerard Manley Hopkins
In high school the biggest dare was to slink 
over the slick rocks flanking Cumberland Falls, 
where the wide but shallow river dives 
seventy feet into a deep pool of froth.
There, people say, catfish big as men twist 
and slither, awaiting suppers sped
their way. You can see a rainbow at night, 
shimmering on the mist during a full
moon and a clear sky. This is true. I snuck
behind the green curtain once with my best
friend, whose name I won’t say because he
never came out. Just as we reached the veil
of water where we would disappear
into another world, I slipped. My right
leg slid down the cold boulder and before
I could plunge into the churning chaos
where torrent met river, he grabbed hold
of my hand. I was so electrified
by his touch I didn’t think of how close
I was to being swept away.
Instead I thought how a small moment
of ecstasy is akin to drowning.
He held on for a beat longer
than necessary. The roar behind
the falls was a deafening symphony heard
only by those brave enough
to penetrate this darksome cavern
carved by centuries. Fern-laden, alive
with the smell of moss. A secret cathedral
made of wildness and wet. We were mesmerized,
and stood watching the cascade as if frozen
yet, as if we might see through to the other side."
Ohio Listening,"It’s autumn in Ohio
Things to be done
Visit the doctor 
Before leaves fall. 
Autumn in Ohio
Black birds southward bound
Darkening the sky
North winds congregate
In fields of dry stalks
A loose shingle rattling 
On the roof. 
Autumn in Ohio
Repairs to be made
Firewood to gather 
Loved ones to hold 
Before the leaves turn gold
And the hawk descends 
Formidable cold. "
Calvin Hernton Seeks to Build and Preserve a House,"To Mildred
  I
Where shall the monument begin
Upon what foundation 
How shall the True House be erected? 

Now you are going away 
I will miss you, I will be lonely, 
I will worry and know sleepless nights
So terrible 
I shall walk dark streets 
Sit in darker places 
And drink     and brood. 

After having pressed my mouth to yours
Lived each breath of your breathing 
After having been told that I am loved 
After having loved, 
In so short a space within confines so desolate, 
Now that you are leaving
I shall walk quietly into a church 
Kneel there before the alter
And pray. 

II

How shall love’s monument begin? 
Upon what foundation shall it be erected? 
Christ died but on the third day he rose. 

The True House is the Temple of God
It is built upon the foundation of the Rock. 
The True Temple is the family. 
Love is the rock. 

The first and last, the indivisible, the
Ever prevailing, undisputable 
Rock! 

III

Once erected
How shall the Temple be preserved? 
I have seen men curse God      in God’s name. 
I see a world filled with haters. 
I see people dancing a dance who have forgotten the meaning, or twisted it 
Beyond its Truth. 
I hear confused, hopeless tongues uttering hopeful words. 

How shall the Truth be preserved? 
Now that you are leaving
I shall be alone. 

IV

Tell them the Temple is based upon
A solid foundation
Tell them the True House of God is created out of love and marriage! 
Conceived by Children
Through the placing-on lips in nights soft as the fur of freshly born kittens
Tell them the True Temple is not an organization for the purpose of self-aggrandizement
Or national expediancy—
The family is a religious institution. 

And when you depart from me, my love, 
Remember, 
                 take this monument with Thee 
                 forget not the altar, where the candle of 
Resurrection flickers about the profile of my 
                 tearful face. 

V

And remember! 
Once erected, even then the True House
Is not so easily preserved. For 
There are those, envious, begrudging, 
Of the house, 
                unbelievers, who stand without, that 
Will strive, will strike out boldly
                  or cowardly
Against the True Temple.
Those who for various and often unscrutinized motives, 
Those who, while standing upon the Rock, will oppose 
                and offend, 
Those who will strive to arrest and destroy

The one Truth
The only House. 

VI

Shall I grieve? 
You know grief will be mine. 
You know I love you committedly and will 
                 suffer during your absence 
Remember! 
The True House is the True Temple
I love you 
              and want to marry. 

The True Temple
The Rock 
The Cathedral 
Must be built from within 
It will prevail against those who oppose
               from without 
               against those who offend. 
It must be built on Love. 

This is the way it must be erected
This is the way it begins
This is the way the family will survive 

This is the monument.

"Crossing Brooklyn Bridge at 4 O’Clock in the Morning, August 4th, 1979","Oh, love spat upon and made mockery of! 

The night’s sorrow
This heart of moon tears in the darkest before sunrise 
This aloneness after betrayal
Dust blown grit of yesterday rot 
This suffocating thirst
This ache to plunge into oblivion!

I, shoulder hunched, hands balled into my pockets, shivering in the cold
Stand at this time morning facing the Bridge of Brooklyn leading across into Manhattan, 
My bridegroom feet covered in running shoes torn by nails of jilt, 
My legs of lactic acid, my knees weakening upon the grates of the bridge, 
My gin eyes, drooped as the lowering of curtains around the one who is dying, 
Peer down into the waters of absolution and scream your name, 
Walt Whitman! Walt Whitman! Walt Whitman! 

Poet of ferry boats and of poets ages hence to come, 
Wound dresser, washer of the slave’s feet, 
Dream keeper who sleeps with prisoners in slumber, 
Oh, nurse of eternal compassion! 
Ferry me across these waters of deceit. 
Bear me safely over this bridge of steel and concrete
That I may live to shed this grief. "
Humility,"I hope I don’t die
before I clean out
the basement
There’s bound to be
embarrassments down there
for my children
Obviously nothing would
bother me once
I was dead
That said I don’t know
why I’d care about
being found out
human by my kids
We all know we are
capable of Shakespearean
faults and vain lusts
blindly murderous impulses
petty jealousies and fooleries
Still it’s difficult to let go
of fearful parental roles
patterned after God
that one you thank
out of reflex knowing
you’ll be gone
when they discover
you were just another
love-clumsy bag of air"
I Believe I Remember Love,"My mother was transforming
another tough pot roast into meat loaf,
grinding up chunks of gristly beef, bovine scraps
she’d boned off a shoulder blade.
As she bore down on the stiff
crank handle & fed the iron gullet
of the meat grinder, the auger hole, I stood
beside her, a shadow, not yet two,
held onto the counter & cutting board, listened to
the squish & roar of meat pushing through
spaghetti sized holes. I was mesmerized
by those oozing red hamburger strings.
In a flash I reached up & plugged a hole
with my finger to stop the flow, didn’t know about
the slashing, windmilling knives
turning industriously, cleaving all meat.
My mother & I screamed, cried hysterically,
held hands & a dish towel full of blood
while my dad drove the thirty miles of curvy
road, a two lane along the river, cussing,
full throttle. They hustled me through the lobby
of the clinic, brick & glass. I saw wheel chairs,
white gowns running about, watched
an overhead light fade. Finally, at home
I remember sitting on the floor in overalls,
a lemon sucker in one hand & plaster
cast on the other, people laughing, smiling at me:
the fabled ""Little Dutch Boy"" who survived
the flood. I was the talk of the neighborhood,
the focus of the family. My first memory,
that trauma, was perfect drama. An audience brings
us joy. Our greatest happiness is
the belief we are loved. It’s what we live for,
what we desire most. We learn to tolerate
any pain, risk blood or breath, anything, if
we believe we are loved, right now, forever."
On the Trail,"four score
and four
a good run
and the good son
tramps behind
dogging the old
man’s heels
to that camp
and the fire
built against
the night
to the bedroll
that invites
tired bones
to lie down
and listen
watch the dying
embers fade
to crackling
heat and shadow
then fall into
the deep sleep
his body needs
so sound
there’s no memory
of a dream"
Credo,"Fractal: a cascade of never-ending, self-similar, repeated
elements that change in scale but retain similar shape.
A
cascade 
of 
infinite 
is why
I believe in 
loops 
and spirals, 
subtle shifts, cycles.
My son, preschooler stunned 
by
the science museum, 
sticks his hand 
into a glacier, 
the chunk 
a broken testimony, 
the history 
of
a world dissolving. Cold!
It’s cold! And
it’s melting. Look right here, he says.
Similarities 
of self
astonish. I see them in 
architecture,
geometry a welcome language, 
shapes
a new alphabet for
prayer and song.
I study Peter Eisenman’s
House 11a
lapping up patterns, interlocking Ls, 
squares and 
replicated rectangles—
the syntax of
ideas. For Frank Gehry’s Guggenheim 
in
Bilbao, syntax looks like
titanium scales rhyming across curves. Glass 
and limestone 
patterns, similarities of 
visual texture,
are creations of weight, depth; order breaks 
tension
where the lines turn. A cascade 
of repeating elements grounds my belief in 
humanity
as mystery. Signs appear: a sound, 
song,
and syllable mean things.
Armadillo! Armadillo! sings my son, 
the youngest,
using his Louis Armstrong
voice; grit gives way to twang and twang turns into hard-rock screams.
He’s an oracle
at four years old, an armor-clad mammal 
his muse.
My oldest son speaks in code, 
echolalia a symptom of a seizure-
besieged brain. When
he utters, No, and No, and No, and 
No,
then I don’t know I don’t know I don’t know, I listen for 
a divine voice revealed.
Cascades changing in scale, not shape, is why I 
trust weight, depth, height-materials and thingness:
Saturn’s rings, the Pacific coastline, bolts of lightning, 
a Romanesco 
cauliflower, angelica flower-
heads, veins
of sycamore leaves, seashells, snowflakes, blood vessels, DNA.
A range and scope of fractals 
inspire awe, a cascade of never-ending 
wonder at both 
connections and aberrations as 
well
as places of perfect order and broken patterns. When 
I consider what we
may be reduced-sized copies of, I grapple 
with insight;
it hovers in physics and biology, the shapes of letters, 
the magic of new languages,
the mystery of cells and synapses, the music 
of my sons’ voices,
the geometries of buildings and trees.
Sometimes
I glimpse an answer, something like seeing starlight years after 
the star dies, supernovas.
Four hours before my youngest son’s birth, I dreamed 
my sister, dead
31 years, placed him in my arms: Take care of him, she said. He has 
her eyes, ice-blue and illumined by 
God."
When my OB/GYN Said He Didn't Understand Poetry,"I worried because my body 
is a more complex text.
When he feels the shape 
of my uterus, he may not 
think pear-shaped yet 
an apricot in size, hollow 
butternut squash, lightbulb.
He may not consider it a bowl 
for a daughter developing inside 
with eggs for her daughters, 
a set like Grandma’s Tupperware 
poised to seal away meals, 
or nested like Russian dolls, 
copies waiting to be twisted off, 
revealed. My doctor speaks 
the body’s language: uterus 
tilted toward spine could 
mean incarceration—womb 
snagged on the pelvic bone.
Almond-shaped ovaries pocked 
like plum pits—if swollen 
with movable lumps— 
could be dermoid, endometrioma, 
or chocolate cysts. Or nothing 
to worry about. He questions
structure, unpuzzles chromosomes, 
scrutinizes tensions between 
biopsies and blood work, and reads 
all this alongside testimony 
and history because my flesh, 
like a poem, carries mystery: 
it produced one child complete
But jettisoned the next four.
My doctor’s glossing of my uterine
purse—whether it will fill and stay full
or remain empty—eludes his science.
But when I build a nest of words,
paradox and ambiguity kiss each time,
offspring running down the page."
"When You're Away, I Consider Form","I don’t make any separations. A poem is a poem.
A building’s a building…. I mean, it’s all structure.
—John Hejduk
I need villanelles of you pulling 
my breath like lines moving down
the page and the promise of rhyme 
bending my ear. I need a sestina
of touch, patterns of palm, stroke,
skim, brush, and rub returning—
a cycle of sound and pressure I
apprehend in my bones. I need
the triolet’s refrain rolling off 
your tongue like a sample, new
and nuanced here and here and here.
It’s all structure is why I need angles
of play, the love our bodies build.
I miss you. The ache's more sour
than a dropped foot, a forced rhyme.
If you're free from me too long,
what will you jettison first? Meter?
Lines? Come home. Our sonnet’s
the fourteen creases in the sheets. 
A couplet of light greens your eyes
only inches from mine when iambs
ascend atop iambs. Please. I need
you in haiku: distilled in syllables,
laid bare in the last line’s turn."
Cognitive Dissonance,"On 11th street, Saturday October 15th,
on a street with “Black Art Matters” color the pavement
& pillars with faces of renaissance-era Black artists
lift up the highway that tears the city in two
& “Black lives matter” is embroidered in a local shop’s window,
I see no Black people. Unless it is MLK day,
or intentional congregations of underfunded Black events,
Black folk retreat to their far-away corners, speaking some
variation of English that sounds like squeaking
styrofoam to those who populate 11th street. My car glides
down a road where a venue, a member of the Chitlin circuit
still stands only cause of national designation,
everything around it fresh as a new gun,
down a road where a monument honors–
through force – Black people in Texas. Down a road
where homies learned how to play ball, tie
their new Christmas shoes, live big despite the meager
bounties put on their heads by this city a century prior,
& it’s nothing but white people. The internet says
In Austin, East 11th is the New SoCo
Homies say In Austin? Our lease is up in February
What is a city if not a slowly rotating thing
baking its Blackness at the speed of capital? Every street,
in every city eager for all the wrong reasons,
reminds me of my skin. It isn’t green enough."
It’s 6 am & the Sun Is Out,"I make peace with this being a beginning:
speaking
when commentary makes me unbelieve
in my body / saying No
when asked if I found a church home
in my respective
shelter city / saying Because
they’re not good people when asked why I don’t attend
family functions / spreading the good word
of moving out 
of a town you could never call home
If home is really where the heart should be
my heart is somewhere in Fort Worth, Texas 
between sundry items at Ramey Market
or sinking in Kool-Aid
at Madea’s Down Home Cooking 
I don’t remember a time I wasn’t lying
about how much something harmed me
I run with the opposite
of progress
every time my father speaks
Congress is no match
to the grave I choose to lay my mind
in / I’m making peace
with all of the I’s in this poem
unfortunately being the speaker
& I am tired
of making peace with small
progress being a precursor
for my death
& ignoring the pleading for A/C
permeating through my clothes every time
a Texas summer gets hotter / I make
peace
with all the living things around me
shaking my hand as if we’ll make it
through this
unscarred & together

is just a metaphor for my falling–"
"On the day of the trial Black America lost, again","I’m ready for mimosas. I’m ready for your phalanges touching
dents in my lower back. I’m ready for wartimes, baby. The kind
where men stumble, drunk with moonshine & memories
that could cut glass if they had enough guts to be knives. I’m ready
to show you my most tongue-dampening salsa dance. Lets tumble
in the kitchen while Spotify shuffles tonight. Let’s drown our tragedy
in bottles cheap & silly with headache-inducing relief– let’s do this till
the next shooting; or winter; or lung-bursting disease that
raptures the world then grows feet & runs. Let’s be kids,
getting jiggy with it in the moonlight while the moon’s still visible
& the cop regime hasn’t burst through. Let’s hope when they knock
down the doors we’re already killing it with our moves.
The carcasses left behind will have the most soulful grooves."
The Host of the Air,"O’Driscoll drove with a song,
The wild duck and the drake,
From the tall and the tufted weeds
Of the drear Hart Lake.
And he saw how the weeds grew dark
At the coming of night tide,
And he dreamed of the long dim hair
Of Bridget his bride.
He heard while he sang and dreamed
A piper piping away,
And never was piping so sad,
And never was piping so gay.
And he saw young men and young girls
Who danced on a level place
And Bridget his bride among them,
With a sad and a gay face.
The dancers crowded about him,
And many a sweet thing said,
And a young man brought him red wine
And a young girl white bread.
But Bridget drew him by the sleeve,
Away from the merry bands,
To old men playing at cards
With a twinkling of ancient hands.
The bread and the wine had a doom,
For these were the host of the air;
He sat and played in a dream
Of her long dim hair.
He played with the merry old men,
And thought not of evil chance,
Until one bore Bridget his bride
Away from the merry dance.
He bore her away in his arms,
The handsomest young man there,
And his neck and his breast and his arms
Were drowned in her long dim hair.
O’Driscoll scattered the cards
And out of his dream awoke:
Old men and young men and young girls
Were gone like drifting smoke;
But he heard high up in the air
A piper piping away,
And never was piping so sad,
And never was piping so gay."
The Systemic,"Strange fall. Trees drop ballots into the yard
without fear of our tampering,
papers flipping along the curb as cars pass by. 
Commiserating with my neighbor about our lives’
missed opportunities, we recall that season 
decades ago when the ripest apples hung like half-punched chads. 
We were children, then. We didn’t even notice
how decorum ferried our parents across their many failures
when they ought to have drowned.
Yesterday, I buried another squirrel.
Every morning, he’d gnaw on my plastic lawn chairs,
shavings accumulating across his tiny organs.
Is his death political? Everything is.
Different, though, those two politics, dying for and dying of."
Territory,"Where the vision was is when / There are wood panels all over the house shared by many people / and I am a collective member of a white simulation in black face / There is a man with a low fade who is my friend without his dreads / Never a mirage / Never my eye casting out to itself in memory / There is a fight between the races / Water in the tiger’s mouth / A window / Twin slate moons huddle on the horizon / an oceanic circus of gray-light / a lion in a bubble / Now, all is on the surface / In the back, two blonde women sit on the floor while praying to the dead / We think this is the reason why we’re all here / Him, the white man sitting next to my friend without dreads / Unleashes his mouth / A backwards tongue gaped in riddle / In a kind of future-speak / Saying what sounds like: Is us behind us is each a door, is each a phantom, is each a pool, is each is a broken river looking back / Everyone is now frozen like statues and won’t say anything when I shake them / I lift the shades of all eyes / and every time / I see the same child"

Under the Spell of Conjunto,"Their boots knew
The footwork, the kickers
The works
The guy was one you’d think knew about ceremony
With his gauges and a ponytail
When the polkas played, when it came to the glide
There was so much at stake in adobe
What did we make out of tall boys and plastic bags?
Older men in SAS botas shined and worked the pearl
Accordion, one broken and kicking in
We didn’t tire of watching the blue neon
On everyone’s face
We were heat-seeking love
Left to our longing and our tubas
Concerned with what’s original
Our partners had to go slower. They dipped us and
Ran out of the bar with their heads hanging on
There is so much at stake in adobe
The couple, they knew what step was next
What was coming—maybe boleritos
Definitely conjunto. Is this banda?
No, it’s one led and the other
Followed but the turn
Wasn’t taut enough
To bring spring back
We wondered if our dancing looked too________
And the lights went off. Let me show you 
How to put it in reverse
We put our cheeks to theirs and sighed
The woman had a dancer’s posture 
She didn’t have to look 
At her partner’s feet to follow his concentric 
She was turquoise and blush 
The band was too small to be a banda 
You need a brass section 
With at least
Twelve more people
We were so chin up and hair swept, entranced
No one noticed
We were running 
Out of time—the cracked beer bottle over black curls 
was coming, but we kept dancing
Like it wasn’t"
Somewhere Else,"I was born in the early evening
behind an old door at the end
                                                of autumn.
Imagine a woman with child.
A mouthful of hair.
A fist forming.
A stone bathtub & a rough sink.
Thick paste of salt 
                                    & cold 
applied directly to 
                        the stain.
Blue eyes. 
A collective 
                        gasp.
The hardwood ladder 
            leaning 
                                                against 
the shadow of dead cells

I was raised

between

When I was a child
there were no words for this        cool
simplicity, 
            collapsing 
                                  over time.
When the water was low

            kaleidoscope of back 
            & forth.
Imagine:
                                  its voice
                                  more like a chorus. 
Its sudden squall.

the fossils
that drowned 
trying to

She Passed This Way,"Here where the trees tremble with your flight
I sit and braid thin whips to beat you down.
How shall we ever find you who have gone
In little dresses, lisping through the town?
Great men on horses hunt you, and strong boys
Employ their arrows in the shallow air.
But I shall be heard whistling where I follow
Braiding long wisps of grass and stallion’s hair.
And in the night when thirty hawks are high
In pendent rhythm, and all the wayside loud;
When they are burning field and bush and hedge,
I’ll steal you like a penny from the crowd."
Half Light,"Translated from the Spanish by Yvette Siegert
I have dreamed of escape, and dreamed
of your silken things all over the floor.
Along a pier sits a new mother,
all of fifteen, who nurses on the hour.
I have dreamed of escape, of ever-afters
Sighed from the ladder below a prow.
I have dreamed of a mother,
A few fresh sprigs of green,
And dawn like a hope chest lined with stars.
     All along a pier. . . 
All along a drowning throat.
    Medialuz
  He soñado una fuga. Y he soñado
tus encajes disperses en la alcoba.
A lo largo de un muelle, alguna madre;
y sus quince años dando el seno a una hora.
He soñado una fuga. Un “para siempre”
suspirado en la escala de una proa;
he soñado una madre;
unas frescas matitas de verdura,
y el ajuar constelado de una aurora.
     A lo largo de un muelle. . . 
Y a lo largo de un cuello que se ahoga!"
Under the Poplars,"Translated from the Spanish by Yvette Siegert
For José Eulogio Garrido
Like inscrutable imprisoned bards,
the blood poplars have gone to sleep.
Out on the hills, the Bethlehem sheep
mouth their grassy arias for the fallen sun.
An ancient shepherd, shaken
to see the light in these martyr throes,
has caught up in his paschal eyes
a batch of chaste and lambent stars.
Cast in orphanhood, he goes down
at word of burial to the praying grounds,
and his shears are autumned with shade.
What’s left of blue is woven dark
in iron lines, and a hound in him with drooping eyes
is chasing after it with his country bark.
    Bajo los álamos
  Para José Eulogio Garrido
Cual hieráticos bardos prisioneros,
los álamos de sangre se han dormido.
Rumian arias de yerba al sol caído,
las greyes de Belén en los oteros.
El anciano pastor, a los postreros
martirios de la luz, estremecido,
en sus pascuales ojos ha cogido
una casta manada de luceros.
Labrado en orfandad baja al instante
con rumores de entierro, al campo orante;
y se otoñan de sombra las esquilas.
Supervive el azul urdido en hierro,
y en él, amortajadas las pupilas,
traza su aullido pastoral un perro."
Babel,"Translated from the Spanish by Yvette Siegert
Sweet ungracious home, forged
From a single blow and a single block
Of sunflower wax. And this is the home
She wrecks and restores, sometimes saying,
“A hospice is nice, and here you have it!”
And sometimes she breaks into sobs.
    Babel
  Dulce hogar sin estilo, fabricado
de un solo golpe y de una sola pieza
de cera tornasol. Y en el hogar
ella daña y arregla; a veces dice:
“El hospicio es bonito; aquí no más!”

The color of old clothes. July in shadows
and August just cut down, and a hand
made of water that grafted its bad fruit
onto a pine of resin and languor.
Now you’ve dropped anchor, dark clothes—
you dampen with the sumptuous scents
of time, of brevities . . . and I have sung of
festive tendencies turned upside down.
But can’t you do something about death,
Lord, about limits, about all that ends?
Oh, this wound the color of old clothes,
it splits, it smells of scalded honey.
Oh, exalted unity—how one thing stands for all.
Love against space and love against time.
The singular beat of the heart,
it has but a single rhythm: God.
And as the boundaries shrug
in disdain both coarse and insurmountable,
a stream of serpents is scattering
upon the damsel abundance of 1.
A wrinkling, a shadow.
    Absoluta
  Color de ropa antigua. Un Julio a sombra,
y un Agosto recién segado. Y una
mano de agua que injertó en el pino
resinoso de un tedio malas frutas.
Ahora que has anclado, oscura ropa,
tornas rociada de un suntuoso olor
a tiempo, a abreviación. . . Y he cantado
el proclive festín que se volcó.
Mas, no puedes, Señor, contra la muerte,
contra el límite, contra lo que acaba?
Ay! la llaga en color de ropa antigua,
cómo se entreabre y huele a miel quemada!
Oh unidad excelsa! Oh lo que es uno
por todos!
Amor contra el espacio y contra el tiempo!
Un latido único de corazón;
un solo ritmo: Dios!
Y al encogerse de hombros los linderos
en un bronco desdén irreductible,
hay un riego de sierpes
en la doncella plenitud del 1.
¡Una arruga, una sombra!"
Rain,"Translated from the Spanish by Yvette Siegert
In Lima . . . in Lima it is raining,
a dirty water from pains
turned lethal. It is raining
through the leaking tiles of your love.
Don’t pretend like you’re sleeping—
only think of your troubadour,
because I get it now, this human cipher
of your love.
The mystical dulcian is thunderous
with its black, tempestuous
stone, the sorcery of your “yes.”
But down pours the rain, down
upon this path of mine, this coffin
where I am mired down for you. . . 
    Lluvia
  En Lima . . . En Lima está lloviendo
el agua sucia de un dolor
qué mortífero! Está lloviendo
de la gotera de tu amor.
No te hagas la que está durmiendo,
recuerda de tu trovador;
que yo ya comprendo . . . comprendo
la humana ecuación de tu amor.
Truena en la mística dulzaina
la gema tempestuosa y zaina,
la brujería de tu “sí”.
Mas, cae, cae el aguacero
al ataúd, de mi sendero,
donde me ahueso para ti. . . "

(Paragraphs)
Hail, Osiris! I got as far as the wall
that stands at the border of life.
And I have this feeling
it has always been at my disposal.
I am the shadow, the reverse: all things
pass beneath the eternal pillars of my steps.
I’ve never dragged anything in by the hair;
it’s all come easy, like an inheritance.
À la Sardanapalus. My mouth, an electric
button from a kind of dream machine.
This is how I’ve reached the wall in front,
and it has always been at my disposal.
Old Osiris! Forgiven be. That nothing
made demands of me—nothing, nothing. . .

Viejo Osiris! Llegué hasta la pared
de enfrente de la vida.
Y me parece que he tenido siempre
a la mano esta pared.
Soy la sombra, el reverso: todo va
bajo mis pasos de columna eterna.
Nada he traído por las trenzas; todo
fácil se vino a mí, como una herencia.
Sardanápalo. Tal, botón eléctrico
de máquinas de sueño fué mi boca.
Así he llegado a la pared de enfrente;
y siempre esta pared tuve a la mano.
Viejo Osiris! Perdónote! Que nada
alcanzó a requerirme, nada, nada. . . "
Sacred Unleaving,"Translated from the Spanish by Yvette Siegert
Oh moon, you crown of an enormous head
thinning in shadowy goldenness!
You crimson crown of a Jesus who thinks
of emeralds with a tragic sweetness.
Oh moon, you crazy heart of the sky,
why row on like this, in the blue wine
of the goblet, and ever westward,
with such a vanquished, aching stern?
Oh moon, by flying away in vain like this,
you obliviate into a spatter of opals;
perhaps you are my gypsy heart, which wails
its verses while wandering out in the blue.
    Deshojación sagrada
  Luna! Corona de una testa inmensa,
que te vas deshojando en sombras gualdas!
Roja corona de un Jesús que piensa
trágicamente dulce de esmeraldas!
Luna! Alocado corazón celeste
¿por qué bogas así, dentro la copa
llena de vino azul, hacia el oeste,
cual derrotada y dolorida popa?
Luna! Y a fuerza de volar en vano,
te holocaustas en ópalos dispersos:
tú eres tal vez mi corazón gitano
que vaga en el azul llorando versos! . . . "
Distant Footsteps,"translated from the Spanish by Yvette Siegert
My father is sleeping. His noble features
reflect a gentle heart.
How sweet he is;
if anything in him is bitter, it must be me.
There is solitude at home, and prayer,
and there isn’t any news of the children today.
My father wakes up. He considers
the flight into Egypt, the bitter goodbye.
How near he is;
if anything in him is distant, it must be me.
And my mother, who moves through
the orchard, tasting a taste grown tasteless:
how soft she is,
how very wing, how departure, how love.
There is solitude at home, no sound,
no news, no green, no childhood.
And if anything this afternoon is broken,
and is going down and creaking,
it’s two old lanes white and curving,
and my heart is walking along them now.
    Los pasos lejanos
  Mi padre duerme. Su semblante augusto
figura un apacible corazón;
está ahora tan dulce. . . 
si hay algo en él de amargo, seré yo.
Hay soledad en el hogar; se reza;
y no hay noticias de los hijos hoy.
Mi padre se despierta, ausculta
la huída a Egipto, el restañante adiós.
Está ahora tan cerca;
si hay algo en él de lejos, seré yo.
Y mi madre pasea allá en los huertos,
saboreando un sabor ya sin sabor.
Está ahora tan suave,
tan ala, tan salida, tan amor.
Hay soledad en el hogar sin bulla,
sin noticias, sin verde, sin niñez.
Y si hay algo quebrado en esta tarde,
y que baja y que cruje,
son dos viejos caminos blancos, curvos.
Por ellos va mi corazón a pie."
To My Brother Miguel,"Translated from the Spanish by Yvette Siegert
In memoriam
Brother, today I’m sitting out on the bench of our house,
where we miss the world out of you.
I remember us playing at this hour, and how Mamá
would soothe us with her “There now, boys. . .”
First it’s my turn to hide,
the way I used to, from all the evening
prayers, and I hope you will not find me.
Through the parlour, the foyer, the corridors.
Now it’s your turn, and I can’t find you.
We’d make each other cry, brother,
whenever we played this game.
Miguel, you hid yourself
one night in August, it was almost morning,
but instead of laughing, you were down.
And here your twin heart, from those days
that are all extinct now, is tired of not finding you.
A shadow is lengthening over my soul.
Listen, brother, don’t be late
in turning up, all right? Mamá will start to worry.
    A mi hermano Miguel
  In memoriam
Hermano, hoy estoy en el poyo de la casa,
donde nos haces una falta sin fondo!
Me acuerdo que jugábamos esta hora, y que mamá
nos acariciaba: “Pero, hijos. . .”
Ahora yo me escondo,
como antes, todas estas oraciones
vespertinas, y espero que tú no des conmigo.
Por la sala, el zaguán, los corredores.
Después, te ocultas tú, y yo no doy contigo.
Me acuerdo que nos hacíamos llorar,
hermano, en aquel juego.
Miguel, tú te escondiste
una noche de agosto, al alborear;
pero, en vez de ocultarte riendo, estabas triste.
Y tu gemelo corazón de esas tardes
extintas se ha aburrido de no encontrarte. Y ya
cae sombra en el alma.
Oye, hermano, no tardes
en salir. Bueno? Puedo inquietarse mamá."
God,"Translated from the Spanish by Yvette Siegert
I feel God walking
deep within me, with the evening and the sea.
With him we leave. The night falls.
With him we nightfall. Orphaning. . . 
But I feel God. It even seems
I take his dictation for some fine color.
Like a hospitalist, he is sad and he is good;
he languishes, a sweet disdainful lover.
How his heart must ache.
Oh, my God, it’s only now I come to you—
this late day, when I am full of love and
turn to the rigged balance of a pair of breasts
to weigh and grieve this frail creation.
But oh you, how you sob . . . you, enamored
of such magnificent encircling breasts. . . 
I consecrate you, God, because you love so deeply,
because you never smile, because of how
your heart must always hurt you.
    Dios
  Siento a Dios que camina
tan en mí, con la tarde y con el mar.
Con él nos vamos juntos. Anochece.
Con él anochecemos, Orfandad. . . 
Pero yo siento a Dios. Y hasta parece
que él me dicta no sé qué buen color.
Como un hospitalario, es bueno y triste;
mustia un dulce desdén de enamorado:
debe dolerte mucho el corazón.
Oh, Dios mío, recién a ti me llego
hoy que amo tanto en esta tarde; hoy
que en la falsa balanza de unos senos,
mido y lloro una frágil Creación.
Y tú, cuál llorarás . . .  tú, enamorado
de tanto enorme seno girador. . . 
Yo te consagro Dios, porque amas tanto;
porque jamás sonríes; porque siempre
debe dolerte mucho el corazón."
Espergesia,"Translated from the Spanish by Yvette Siegert
I was born on a day
when God was sick.
They all know I exist,
that I’m evil, but they do not know
about December of that January.
For I was born on a day
when God was sick.
There is a void
in my metaphysical state
that no one is likely to feel:
a cloister of silence
that spoke like a flowering fire.
I was born on a day
when God was sick.
Brother, listen, listen. . . 
That’s fine. Do not let me leave
without taking the Decembers,
without discarding the Januaries.
For I was born on a day
when God was sick.
They all know I exist,
that I chew . . . but they do not know
why, in my verses, the scouring
winds unravel from the Sphinx,
busybody of the Desert,
to screech, off-key,
a casket’s dark displeasure.
They all know. . . but they do not know
that the Light is consumptive
while the Shadow is corpulent.
They do not know how Mystery can synthesize. . . 
It is the sad and musical hunchback
denouncing, from a distance,
the passing of noon from the limits to the Limits.

gravely so.

que mastico. . . Y no saben
por qué en mi verso chirrian,
oscuro sinsabor de féretro,
luyidos vientos
desenroscados de la Esfinge
preguntona del Desierto.
Todos saben . . . Y no saben
que la Luz es tísica,
y la Sombra gorda. . . 
Y no saben que el Misterio sintetiza. . . 
que él es la joroba
musical y triste que a distancia denuncia
el paso meridian de las lindes a las Lindes.
Yo nací un día
que Dios estuvo enfermo,
grave."
Friends with No Benefits,"I now replace desire 
with meaning. 
Instead of saying, I want you, I say, 
there is meaning between us.
Meaning can swim, has taken lessons from the river 
of itself. Desire is air. One puncture 
above a black lake and she lies flat.
I now replace intensity with meaning.
One is a black hole of boundless appetite, a false womb,
another is a sentence.
My therapist says children need a “father” for language 
and a “mother” for everything else.
She doesn’t get that it’s all language. There is no else. 
Else is a fiction of life, and a fact of death.
That night, we don’t touch. 
We ruin nothing. 
We get bagels in the morning before you leave on a train, 
and I smoke a skinny cigarette and think 
I look glam, like an Italian diva.
You make a joke at my expense, which is not a joke, really, 
but a way to say I know you. 
I don’t feed on you. Instead, I watch you 
like a faraway tree. 
Desire loves the what if, the if only, the maybe in another lifetime. 
She loves a parallel universe. Or seven. 
Meaning knows its minerals,
knows which volcanic magma belongs 
to which volcanic fleet.
Knows the earth has parents. That a person is raised. 
It’s the real flirtation, to say, you are not a meal. 
To say, I want you 
to last. "
Aurora Americana,"The most interesting thing about emptiness is that it is preceded by fullness. —Joseph Brodsky
1.
She leaves me outside among yellowing
aspens.  Hemlock branches
discarded     dying on this iced clod.

Corms in the ground whiten waiting for another snow.
Fissured face     the skin of me fissured.
The leather of a carriage no longer

fit to front a manor with sequoia moldings
or doors carved in California     shipped
to Louisiana to shut in that house.

Made for another girl now dead.  Her mother
made me out of that tatty carriage-seat leather.
Made me as she evoked her mother’s

country dissolved in seawater.
I’m the leavings of seawater left cold.
Forgotten in cold.

Forgotten in this northern place.
They have forgotten what I have not.
The dark is without forgetting.

That woman filled me with pink
cotton     that annual spell when
cotton explodes that gaudy hue.

I’m holding time in the dark     waiting
for the dappling of sky.
I hear them.

I know them.
They’ll do the thing that wrecks.
They’re unworthy of themselves.
This knowledge wrecks.
But a jester?
That jester?
His brashness     a theory of this land.
A quality encouraged for navigation.
I’m not protected.
Cold     unprotected at night.
Solitary at night inducing 
more creasing     more
staining as they stain themselves     as 
they beg for regression.  As
they beg for the nineteenth 
century     the century I was made.
Hold the clock’s clicking.
Turn it back     make-make America.
She leaves me to see this night.
To see blue televisions through windows.
To hear raucous commentary.
She leaves me to see this night     to
freeze among the frozen.
There’s yellow in the trees tonight.
The girl who leaves me wears 
a yellow dress.
Her boots are white.
2.
I voted for snow     frost     crystals.
I see them falling.
I’ve been falling into myself.
I see myself with myself.
I hold my own hand as I walk through snow.
I walk with my twin.
I wish for a country of twins.
Our slacks are patterned with stars.
We are partisans.
We believe in the belief.
There is only one belief.
There is only one nation.
We are the founders of the nation.
Our blood for this nation.
Our blood in this nation is the nation.
We see it in sunset.
All that we’ve given is sunset.
We aspire to what the billionaire has built.
The lavishness of pink marble 
wild in our sleep.
We want what he has.
We believe what he has is his.
We believe his dream is American.
We believe his reality can be ours.
We believe in oligarchy     ours.
We’re waiting for the chalice    that goddess’s 
slow pouring of shine.
But that frozen doll frightens me.
I’m walking away but I keep 
craning toward it.
Its face of creature     its darkness
on that which is frozen.
I leave it there.
They’re left.  They’re not me.
We voted for snow     its perpetual system.
Radically radical we voted.
3.
He wanted me away. 
I want him away from 
that public house.
In his dream     I’m the boy 
locked in steel.
There’s water in his dream.
I sank.
He saw my hands reaching 
from the steel until they didn’t.
I was a boy.
We were boys.
He wanted to kill the boy.
He wanted the boy dead 
in steel     quickly 
a man in steel.
We became men in steel.
In the paper     he bought our
capture     shouted execution.  
Years in steel.
The sky’s steel here.
It’s cold here.
My daughter is here.
I want her to play.
Be a good girl     play.
I want him away from 
that public house.
How’s he a choice?
Up in Michigan     near Lake 
Superior waiting for spirals     funnels 
of jade     ginger light.
This dawn is near but which dawn?
Which will be created?
So cold here in this north.
The north couldn’t protect.
When has it ever protected?
When has this place protected me?
But I’m trying to protect my 
north     my daughter 
in winter-white boots.  
The breeze isn’t silent. 
I want him away from 
that public house.
I stare skyward yet I see 
the glare of televisions.
My daughter’s fingers are cold. 
4.
My father is afraid 
but he doesn’t say it.
I came in from playing to see 
him     to be around him.  
His hands are colder than snow.
His hands are chapped.
Why are your hands so cold?
The past was cold.  I don’t want 
the past to permit what may come.
What?
He embraces me.  The world
is around me.
Snow     strange     I’m waiting 
for something I don’t understand.
Will you wait for me?
I’m here     forever here     around.
He’s angry at the television.
The blue of the television 
is what’s inside him.
If I could open him     an abrupt
door I could open     step into 
the blue     step into to brightness
burning my eyes.  
I’m quickly blind
within the blue of my father.
He mentions     jester.
He mentions     clown.
He mentions     criminal.
He mentions     killer.
Where’s your doll?
I’ve left her without knowing.
Left her freezing     left her among snow
without protection.
I have to find her.
Go find her.
Bring her inside.
My coat like skin     fake fur on skin.
I’m running back to save 
the one I forgot.
How could I forget her?
She has been forgotten before
but I didn’t want to forget.
Everything tall     green
heavy with whiteness.
My father’s upset even 
when there are auroras
above him     above me     above
this country.

5.
It isn’t dawn when she returns.
But I thought if there would
be a return it would happen at dawn
when America shows what she
hides     what she whispers     what
she denies in conversation     what
she calls crazy in public.
I know this place.
I know its makers.
Those with soft 
hands     rough     always
rough who smile 
yet hide tundras. 
Within them tundras with paths
lined with wet spikes.
Something dead on the spikes. 
Something dying on the spikes.
She’s kissing me.
I’m being carried     kissed
among firs     snow blowing.
They will do it.
They have done it before.
Regression     angry at the lie
they can’t keep from questioning.
I’m loved by a little girl
who knows nothing of me.
I want her father to scream.
If he doesn’t     he may die early.  
He may leave his daughter early.  
So many men leave their daughters early.
Don’t be shocked.
Perhaps you’ve left your daughter?
Fissured face     the skin of me fissured.
Does she know what these fissures hold?
Does she know what she holds?
Does she know what 
her father’s holding?  
What he doesn’t say 
when he sees her     when
he sees the jester?
His hands are over his ears?
She sees him on the porch
as if holding his head together.
It could erupt.
It could combust    St. Helens.
Dust     fire     smoke like 
that mountain.  
We’re all combustible.
But first     implosion.
The birches within us falling.
Not the leaves in autumn 
but the trees themselves     falling.
Paper bark     mangled.
The hidden thump     that
crash beneath ivory cages     skin.
This isn’t greatness.
This isn’t noble.  
A terrible enactment in 
the dark     the light     the cold.
She drops me on the porch
to hold her father’s face.
Hold me.
Hold.
Hold.
Hold.
Hold.

6.
I’m cold here.
Waiting as blue hits my face.
I’ve made a fire.
Crackle.
Crackle.
My son burns marshmallows.  
They’re gooey on graham 
crackers.  Chocolate melts 
on sweet sandwiches.  
The auroras are rare.
I want my son to see the auroras     that 
which is possible in sky.
This was my place as a boy.
This was where my parents took 
me to say this is ours.  
This piece of it is ours.
We feed ducks bread.
But what bread feeds us now?
There’s poison in the bread.
We’re losing.
So much poison     poison
to survive but we 
are surviving without ourselves.
Save us.
Save us with your wealth.
Save us with the way you make wealth.
Fire what’s killing us.  Burn the ground.
Wall us in.  We are being killed.
They are killing us.
Aurora.
Aurora my love     I’m 
waiting for Aurora.
When you come     will we be saved?
Auroras in that sky swirl in the cold.
O beautiful for spacious skies,
For amber waves of….
7.
This is reality?
This is a reality star?
His reality isn’t our 
reality but they believe it can be.
Their reality is fake.
Their false reality exists in their minds.
They are convinced of their reality.
Some realities are based in trickery. 
They want to change a false reality.
But how can they change a reality that doesn’t exist 
other than to change the falseness of that reality 
into what’s actual?  Oh     he changed my reality     that 
reality of innocence to criminal.
My reality became prison.
His fake reality made my reality     my 
reality of childhood to manhood fugacious.
My reality of custody     trial    conviction
was his     the country’s made reality. 
The reality is     it is almost dawn.
The reality is     my daughter is sleeping.
The reality is     this place is now more dangerous for her.
The reality is     auroras are stunning.
I’m staring at the reality of stunning auroras.
I’m in a reality stunned. 
8.
Dawn gleams. 
In my dream     my father is content.
He’s unworried.  
He’s lifting me into cloying light.
I’m wearing a dress of light he has made.
So many are waving at us.
We’re waving back.
A chalice of light was poured 
into the sky.
Snow’s falling.
Snow the color of light is falling
but we aren’t cold.

"You, Emblazoned","for Kelly Caldwell (1988–2020)
Yet your voice was here—
                         just there-here in our house, shining eyes
who dazzled twice, already timed,
a pulsing wind below the glass in spring,
and coaxed, intelligent, stoic, touching everything, you stirred
me to life, in spite of illness and damage
to the country, field laid waste, election blaze, illness
wasting a brain, a mind. Mars, and ocean, canceled.
Cream and streamers, canceled, 
                                                  censored. 
“I am,” you said, 
                         though your skin flickered
to hackberry bark, or as bullet 
pierced pineal gland, blinking out
your day-night clock. Your syllables
endure frail days, which blow
through equinox, dissipate, time out—
            you imagined the planet
            with you already gone:
a sad expression, no real loss, the earth still a wild salon,
yet the name you chose
is etched into air, a violent wind
parts my chest, tenderviolet, electric
nights in our sheets, no longer 
countable, unrecounted. You, here, again,
my is-are-were, have-been-is, in my 
arms, bed is-was our house-eyes, in my 
only thought only root only gone,
my big only gone still here voice
blazing, I mourn you-her, 
her-you, who were born-dreamed into the world’s thicket
yet reinvented through an inner radiance, 
the radiance of a name, 
the name that is yours,
the radiance that is-was yours 
                                    that is-was you—"
Decolonialish Self-Portrait,"I remember myself;
—a chair, turning—
a desperate blue tunnel
crossing the mirror
in the lavender hour.
I remember myself;
a corner of sunlight
on the bed sheet rotating
a violence, words that die
before meaning:
relentless shredded threads.
I remember myself;
sky chained to torture,
futurity chokes:
an ancient throat melts
in my posing.
I remember myself;
a swipe in the dust
on my dresser, a drawer full 
of rotten Christian teeth."
Let No Charitable Hope,"Now let no charitable hope
Confuse my mind with images
Of eagle and of antelope:
I am by nature none of these.
I was, being human, born alone;
I am, being woman, hard beset;
I live by squeezing from a stone
The little nourishment I get.
In masks outrageous and austere
The years go by in single file;
But none has merited my fear,
And none has quite escaped my smile."
Icy Bulwarks,"Translated from the Spanish by Yvette Siegert
Every day, I come to watch you pass,
little steamer, magical and always distant. . . 
Your eyes are a pair of blondish captains,
your lip a slip of kerchief, red and
bidding its blood goodbyes.
I will come to watch you pass—
drunk on time, on cruelty, you magical
little steamer, always distant—until that day
when the evening star takes leave.
The rigging, the traitor winds, the currents
from a woman who just walked past—
Then your cold captains will issue orders,
And the one to take leave will be me.
    Bordas de Hielo
  Vengo a verte pasar todos los días,
vaporcito encantado siempre lejos. . . 
Tus ojos son dos rubios capitanes;
tu labio que ondea en un adios de sangre!
Vengo a verte pasar; hasta que un día,
embriagada de tiempo y de crueldad,
vaporcito encantado siempre lejos,
la estrella de la tarde partirá!
Las jarcias; vientos que traicionan; vientos
de mujer que pasó!
Tus fríos capitanes darán orden;
y quien habrá partido seré yo. . . !"
Plaster,"Translated from the Spanish by Yvette Siegert
Silence. Night has fallen here already.
The sun has gone down behind the tombs,
And now a thousand eyes are crying,
Do not come back. My heart is dead already. 
Silence. Where everything is fitted in
A stiff lament, and this passion is like
Mediocre kerosene that barely burns.
Spring will come. You will sing “Eve”
From a narrow ledge, from the furnace
Where Eros kindles his spikenards.
Forge a pardon there for the poet,
Though it is sure to hurt me,
Like the nail that seals the coffin. 
But . . . there will come a lyrical night when
Your fine breasts, your red sea
Will crash with the waves of your fifteen years,
Once you spy, far off and full of memory,
My corsair, my ingratitude.
Then your apple orchard, your lips, yielding
To be creased a final time, to die
With the blood of too much love,
Like a Jesus sketched profanely—
Oh, my love. And you will start singing—
The female part of my soul reverberating
Like a cathedral in its grief. 
    Yeso
  Silencio. Aquí se ha hecho ya de noche,
ya tras del cementerio se fué el sol;
aquí se está llorando a mil pupilas:
no vuelvas; y murió mi corazón.
Silencio. Aquí ya todo está vestido
de dolor riguroso; y arde apenas,
como un mal kerosene, esta pasión.
Primavera vendrá. Cantarás “Eva”
desde un minute horizontal, desde un
hornillo en que arderán los nardos de Eros.
¡Forja allí tu perdón para el poeta,
que ha de dolerme aún,
como clavo que Cierra un ataúd!
Mas . . . una noche de lirismo, tu
buen seno, tu mar rojo
se azotará con olas de quince años,
al ver lejos, aviado con recuerdos
mi corsario bajel, mi ingratitud.
Después, tu manzanar, tu labio dándose,
y que se aja por mí por la vez última,
y que muere sangriento de amar mucho,
como un croquis pagano de Jesús.
Amada! Y cantarás;
y ha de vibrar el femenino en mi alma,
como en una enlutada catedral."
Fresco,"Translated from the Spanish by Yvette Siegert
I came to confuse her with myself,
and how! Through all her spiritual
meanderings, I continued
to play in the strawberry fields,
in the sunrise of her Grecian hands.
After this, she’d come to adjust
my black, unruly tie, and I’d
go back to observing the stone
in its absorption, and the fallow benches,
and the clock that reeled us in
at every stroke of its eternal clockwork.
Good nights they were,
that make me laugh now,
for the strange manner of my dying,
for my brand of ruminations.
Golden confections,
sugary gems
that finally crumble
beneath the stony mortar of this world.
But if your tears are tears of love,
the morning stars are lovely silks,
in lilacs
and oranges
and greens,
soaking full of the heart.
And if their silken threads get choked with bile,
then another silk, all great and apocalyptic,
will reach down from a certain love,
one never born, and one that never dies
—blue, unedited, the hand of God.
    Fresco
  Llegué a confundirme con ella,
tanto. . . ! Por sus recodos
espirituales, yo me iba
jugando entre tiernos fresales,
entre sus griegas manos matinales.
Ella me acomodaba después los lazos negros
y bohemios de la corbata. Y yo
volvía a ver la piedra
absorta, desairados los bancos, y el reloj
que nos iba envolviendo en su carrete,
al dar su inacabable molinete.
Buenas noches aquellas,
que hoy la dan por reír
de mi extraño morir,
de mi modo de andar meditabundo.
Alfeñiques de oro,
joyas de azúcar
que al fin se quiebran en
el mortero de losa de este mundo.
Pero para las lágrimas de amor,
los luceros son lindos pañuelitos
lilas,
naranjas,
verdes,
que empapa el corazón.
Y si hay ya mucha hiel en esas sedas,
hay un cariño que no nace nunca,
que nunca muere,
vuela otro gran pañuelo apocalíptico,
la mano azul, inédita de Dios!"
Summer,"Translated from the Spanish by Yvette Siegert
Summer, I am leaving. And how they pain me,
These meek hands of your afternoons. 
You arrive devout; you arrive old; and now
You will find my soul with no one in it. 

Oh, summer. You pass through my balconies
With your great rosary of amethyst and gold
Like a tragic bishop who travels far
To find and bless the broken 
Rings of two dead lovers. 

Summer, I am leaving. And there in September,
You will find a rose I’ve left especially in your care,
For you to tend to with holy water
On all the days of sin and tombs.

If, from all the sobbing, the mausoleum
Should spread its marble wings in the light of faith,
Lift up your voice and pray to God
The light stays dead forever.
Everything is late already.
You will find my soul with no one in it.

There now, summer, no more sobbing. The rose in
That furrow will die but bloom and bloom again. 
    Verano
  Verano, ya me voy. Y me dan pena
las manitas sumisas de tus tardes.
Llegas devotamente; llegas viejo;
y ya no encontrarás en mi alma a nadie.
Verano! y pasarás por mis balcones
con gran rosario de amatistas y oros,
como un obispo triste que llegara
de lejos a buscar y bendecir
los rotos aros de unos muertos novios.
Verano, ya me voy. Allá, en setiembre
tengo una rosa que te encargo mucho;
la regarás de agua bendita todos
los días de pecado y de sepulcro.
Si a fuerza de llorar el mausoleo,
con luz de fe su mármol aletea,
levanta en alto tu responso, y pide
a Dios que siga para siempre muerta.
Todo ha de ser ya tarde;
y tú no encontrarás en mi alma a nadie.
Ya no llores, Verano! En aquel surco
muere una rosa que renace mucho. . . "
The Black Heralds,"Translated from the Spanish by Yvette Siegert
Some blows in life, they’re so heavy . . . I don’t know.
Blows as if dealt by God’s own wrath, as if, ahead,
the rip of every single thing we’d ever suffered
had pooled inside our souls . . . I don’t know.
These are few, but there they are . . . They carve
dark trenches in the toughest faces, the fiercest backs.
Perhaps they’re the racks of barbarous Attilas,
or else the black heralds that Death has sent us.
They’re the steep fall of some Christ from the soul,
of the laudable faith that Fate can make foul of.
Those bloodied blows are the sounds of bread
crackling in oven doors, turning to charcoal.
As for man . . . woe is he . . .  woe. He turns his gaze,
as if answering the call of a slap on the shoulder:
his expression is wild and all that he’s lived through
is settled, like penitent pools, in his eyes.
Some blows in life, they’re so heavy . . . I don’t know.
    Los heraldos negros
  Hay golpes en la vida, tan fuertes . . . Yo no sé!
Golpes como del odio de Dios; como si ante ellos,
la resaca de todo lo sufrido
se empozara en el alma . . . Yo no sé!
Son pocos, pero son. . .  Abren zanjas oscuras
en el rostro más fiero y en el lomo más fuerte.
Serán tal vez los potros de bárbaros atilas;
o los heraldos negros que nos manda la Muerte.
Son las caídas honda de los Cristos del alma,
de alguna fe adorable que el Destino blasfema.
Esos golpes sangrientos son las crepitaciones
de algún pan que en la Puerta del horno se nos quema.
Y el hombre. . .  Pobre . . .  pobre! Vuelve los ojos, como
cuando por sobre el hombre nos llama una palmada;
vuelve los ojos locos, y todo lo vivido
se empoza, como un charco de culpa, en la mirada.
Hay golpes en la vida, tan fuertes . . . Yo no sé!"

The Man Whose Pharynx Was Bad,"The time of year has grown indifferent.
Mildew of summer and the deepening snow
Are both alike in the routine I know.
I am too dumbly in my being pent.
The wind attendant on the solstices
Blows on the shutters of the metropoles,
Stirring no poet in his sleep, and tolls
The grand ideas of the villages.
The malady of the quotidian . . .
Perhaps, if summer ever came to rest
And lengthened, deepened, comforted, caressed
Through days like oceans in obsidian
Horizons full of night’s midsummer blaze;
Perhaps, if winter once could penetrate
Through all its purples to the final slate,
Persisting bleakly in an icy haze;
One might in turn become less diffident—
Out of such mildew plucking neater mould
And spouting new orations of the cold.
One might. One might. But time will not relent."

Apples,"No shade of waxy red
or soft white mealy flesh;
nothing simple—as what tempted Eve.
I crave a rarer kind:
small and bitter and hard to get—
not crab, neither gala, nor golden
but those of wild occasion:
musky ones in bloom of spring
or cool as autumn dew;
those that rise and fall the swallow,
not duds fell to the ground.
Seething with speech to defy the tree,
I want the fruit with singing taste,
grown in the throats of men."
Luke and the Frog: An American Fairytale OR What It Feels Like to Be a Parent in America,"On the Monday after Mother’s Day, 
after another mass shooting, 
I pick up my daughter from school 
and on the ride home while she munches 
on veggie chips and looks out the window, 
she tells me a modern day fairytale:
“Luke killed a frog today 
at the playground
during recess
the frog was small
not a baby frog
a teenage frog
because he had a medium-sized body 
not a small body
a green & blue medium-sized spotted body 
Luke stepped on it & stepped on it
until there was blood
& the teacher had to call the frog ambulance
& Luke was put on the naughty list
& I was the only one who yelled stop! 
Stop! Don’t kill it! 
but Luke wouldn’t listen
& the others joined in on the stomping
& I yelled stop! 
but no one would listen
& they stomped & stomped
& killed the frog 
& and it bled red
out of its eyes
out of its head
& it made me sad
& can we buy the frog flowers
because when someone dies they should get flowers
& Mami, what if that frog was supposed to be a prince 
but now he’s dead
& now we’ll never know”"

though  i  find  the  song  familiar,  enraptured  by
the  notes  swimming  out  our  mouths, the  little

with  the  gravity,  each   cell  being  called  to  the

Mujer Malvada,"To La Siguanaba
I sprout from your black
waters—arms rooting 
to earth, bajo luna del lago
Coatepque. I am birthed
from your memory, given
a new skin and hide
to brush and braid, ashes
de Izalco dusting my hair. 
My hands, still my hands,
marked by your myth:
calloused, rope-burned, 
nails sharpened to blade.
My face, still my face,
goes missing sometimes
(just like yours, Sihuehuet.)
My body, my body,
safe because you took
yours back. Safe because
you took theirs instead. "
Season of Grief,"My grandmother sat at the head of her oak table 
one Labor Day afternoon & in a lull turned to me & said 
all the people I knew are dead. When she fixed those two words, I knew, 
I felt my heart in the world beat its blood through thin chambers. The constant 
rush still interrupts the body I didn’t make, but keep breathing somehow
& functioning until I can’t, & the night before she died, I felt the easing of her spirit, 
& the same when my aunt died the year before. I still say to my still-grieving 
cousin I’m here—an echo of her mother’s absence, & we are left 
together on this side of unknowing, stack like throwing bricks 
all the finite seasons we have 
& will spend without them. Up against my own lifetime
I wish for fog, early morning. Instead, unpredictable years keep emptying. "
Autumnal,"translated from the Spanish by Thomas Walsh and Salomón de la Selva
In the pale afternoon the clouds go by
Aimlessly roving in the quiet sky.
His head between his hands, the dreamer weaves
His dream of clouds and Autumn-colored leaves.
Ah, his intimate sorrow, his long sighs,
And the glad radiance that has dimmed his eyes!
And all the tender glances, the blond tresses,
The rose hands over-brimming with caresses,
The sudden faces smiling everywhere
In the gold-dusted curtains of the air!
In the pale afternoon
A friendly faerie maiden comes to me
And tells me tales of many a secret thing
Fraught with the spell and music of the moon,
And I have learned what wonder the birds sing,
And what the breezes bring over the sea,
All that lies hidden in the mist or gleams,
A floating presence, in a young girl’s dreams.
And once the thirst of infinite desire
Possessed me like a fever, and I said,
“I want to feel all radiance, fragrance, fire
And joy of life within me, to inspire
My soul forever!” And the faerie maid
Called me to follow her, and when she spoke
It was as if a harp to the soft stroke
Of loving hands had wakened suddenly:
She syllabled hope’s language, calling me.
Oh, thirst for the ideal! From the height
Of a great mountain forested with night
She showed me all the stars and told their names;
It was a golden garden wherein grows
The fleur-de-lys of heaven, leaved with flames.
And I cried, “More!” and then the dawn arose.
The dawn came blushing; on her forehead beamed
Delicate splendor, and to me it seemed
A girl that, opening her casement, sees
Her lover watching her, and with surprise
Reddens but cannot hide her from his eyes.
And I cried, “More!” The faerie maiden smiled
And called the flowers, and the flowers were
Lovely and fresh and moist with essences,—
The virgin rose that in the woods grows wild,
The gentle lily tall and shy and fair,
The daisy glad and timid as a child,
Poppies and marigolds, and all the rare
Blossoms that freight with dreams the evening air.
But I cried, “More!” And then the winds brushed by
Bearing the laughter of the world, the cry
Of all glad lovers in the woods of Spring,
And echoes, and all pleasant murmuring
Of rustling leaf or southward-flying bird,
Unworded songs and musics never heard.
The faerie maiden, smiling, led me where
The sky is stretched over the world, above
Our heights and depths of hoping and despair,
Beyond the reach of singing and of love.
And then she tore the veil. And I saw there
That all was dawn. And in the deeps there beamed
A woman’s Face radiant exceedingly.—
Ah, never, Muses, never could ye say
The holy joyance that enkindled me!—
“More? . . .” said the faerie in her laughing way;
But I saw the Face only. And I dreamed.
    Autumnal
  Eros, Vita, Lumen
    En las pálidas tardes
yerran nubes tranquilas
en el azul; en las ardientes manos
se posan las cabezas pensativas.
¡Ah los suspiros! ¡Ah los dulces sueños!
¡Ah las tristezas íntimas!
¡Ah el polvo de oro que en el aire flota,
tras cuyas ondas trémulas se miran
los ojos tiernos y húmedos,
las bocas inundadas de sonrisas,
las crespas cabelleras
y los dedos de rosa que acarician!
   En las pálidas tardes
me cuenta un hada amiga
las historias secretas
llenas de poesía;
lo que cantan los pájaros,
lo que llevan las brisas,
lo que vaga en las nieblas,
lo que sueñan las niñas.
   Una vez sentí el ansia
de una sed infinita.
Dije al hada amorosa:
—Quiero en el alma mía
tener la inspiración honda, profunda,
inmensa: luz, calor, aroma, vida.
Ella me dijo:—¡Ven! con el acento
con que hablaría un arpa. En él había
un divino aroma de esperanza.
¡Oh sed del ideal!
                       Sobre la cima
de un monté, á media noche,
me mostró las estrellas encendidas.
Era un jardín de oro
con pétalos de llama que titilan.
Exclamé:—Más . . .
                       La aurora
vino después. La aurora sonreía,
con la luz en la frente,
como la joven tímida
que abre la reja, y la sorprenden luego
ciertas curiosas, mágicas pupilas.
Y dije:—Más . . . sonriendo
la celeste hada amiga
prorrumpió:—¡Y bien! ¡Las flores!
                       Y las flores
estaban frescas, lindas,
empapadas de olor: la rosa virgen,
la blanca margarita,
la azucena gentil y las volúbiles
que cuelgan de la rama estremecida.
Y dije:—Más . . .
                       El viento
arrastraba rumores, ecos, risas,
murmullos misteriosos, aleteos,
músicas nunca oídas.
El hada entonces me llevó hasta el velo
que nos cubre las ansias infinitas,
la inspiración profunda
y el alma de las liras.
Y los rasgó. Y allí todo era aurora.
En el fondo se vía
un bello rostro de mujer.
                       ¡Oh; nunca,
   Piérides, diréis las sacras dichas
que en el alma sintiera!
Con su vaga sonrisa:—
—¿Más? . . .—dijo el hada.—Y yo tenía entonces,
clavadas las pupilas"

from “Everything Shimmers”,"translated from the Danish by Susanna Nied
Then suddenly beech woods, all green behind the dozing eyes
a deer leaps across the forest road
scents of acid and moss and cheek against bark, sunrain
between trunks, I’m home and hear the Baltic Sea
crash against big rocks far away and I rest like a
fairy or a witch in the sweet smells of the forest floor
we can so easily forget what we are who we are
that we are, but it takes only a little call
to waken the sleepers, as now, in the forest, for
LISTEN, isn’t that song and the chiming of goblets
sounding in the green chambers? YES by golly, a celebration
for the child in his seventeenth year, who never has
been happier and never will be happier; the world shimmers
everything unimaginably possible while a handspring
and a new but not disturbing sensitivity have settled
in the middle of his irresistibly marzipanescent
body.
    Alting Blinker
  Så pludselig bøgeskov, helt grønt bag de blundende øjne
en hind springer over den stampede jordvej
her lugter af syre og mos og kinden mod bark, solregn
mellem stammer, jeg er hjemme og hører Østersøen
slå mod store sten langt borte er jeg hvilende som en
fe eller en heks i skovbundens dufte
vi kan så let glemme at vi er dem vi er
at vi er, men der skal bare et lille signal til
at vække den slumrende, som nu, i skoven, for
HØR NU er det ikke sang og bægerklang
der lyder i de grønne sale? JO, et gilde sørme
for barnet i sit syttende år, der aldrig har
haft det bedre og aldrig får det bedre; verden blinker
alting ufatteligt muligt mens et kraftspring
og en ny men ikke forstyrrende følsomhed har slået sig ned
midt i den uimodståeligt marcipanemmende
krop."
Autumn Leaves,"Mother gave birth to me in the fall 
in the midst of grieving trees and withering leaves. 
Winter came home right after 
accompanied by winds of solitude. 
My earliest memories revolved around cold weather 
yet I remember meeting with summer  
before ever blowing my first candle. 
I saw these same trees shimmer in full bloom. 
I saw their branches clothed in vivid green. 
Early on,  
I learned not to shed a tear when autumn leaves 
for I know that summer comes home through the shiver. "
Temporary Shelters,"I know of men with holes  
who carry wounds  
and place them within wombs. 
They roam about,  
searching for security  
within a woman’s body. 
Because the only place  
they’ve ever felt at home  
was in their mother’s body.  
In longing for that same feeling,  
they search and search and search. 

These men, carry wounds  
and place them within wombs. 
Addicted to the warmth,  
they hope to find shelter within a stranger, 
only to come out feeling colder and emptier.  

The void is not gone. 
The bleeding is still on.  
Temporary shelters  
do not keep you warm forever. "
Dove,"When we sought God, when we asked Him to come, 
when we opened the door and allowed Him in, when we 
washed our masks, when we humbled ourselves, 
destroying the walls we had created–to keep us from 
loving, hoping, aching and breaking. When we
showed Him the truest parts of ourselves, He began to feel 
comfortable in the rooms we had on lock. He began to 
clean them up–taking out the dirt that covered us with
shame. He arranged our broken vases and reframed our 
self-portrays. He began to own our homes, we began to 
feel clean, we began to feel pure. Once we allowed Him in, 
we began to heal.

To Mars from Arizona,"Saturday mornings were science fiction—
That is, on that day anything was possible.
We didn’t have to go to the movies for that,
Though when we did, we were introduced to ourselves
More than anything. Ourselves in rockets,
Ourselves taking chances, ourselves speaking to the universe.
Outside of the movies, we were still in them—
Our bikes were our rockets, our submarines, our jets.
But mostly, and first, our bikes were our horses 
In this childhood West, a loyal, red Western Flyer
Taking me everywhere, up and down, fast and slow.
Only later did I understand it was my own legs
That did it all. My own legs and my arms to steer,
My own small, mighty lungs to shout—
A shout that would later become a song.
When they weren’t horses, when my legs were tired,
When the shouts calmed down into just talking,
We bike-riders would sit, and find in that talking 
The gold we had been looking for, though we didn’t know it.
The gold was made of plans for Saturdays still to come—
We each had different ideas, but we all had them,
Speaking them confidently as if we were lions,
Deep-voiced and sure even in that quietude.
What would happen next was far away,
But even as we rested, something in us knew
We would catch the future no matter how fast it ran."
Being pregnant is a dream,"You’re pregnant?

Planet Dread,"Dreadnought, I. Dread from the sea I was drawn, I
blue as dread, tender dread, taloned as our future dread.
Dread the constellation I was born under, dread I
slept under, dread the waves of history, blustering red.
Dread my mother’s calm. Dread the harpy’s song. Dread she
nursed me, dread she named me. Dread my girlhood
under sugar cane. Dread the hurricane. I was a child
of dread a psalm of dread, dread pressed into my palm
like the blessed herb. A divine dread, Rastaman said. Before I
could speak there was dread, before I could stumble.
Dread roamed the shore a ghostly spume, dreadless thread
of the woman I’m erasing, dread my one coastline crumbling
to sea rise, to abyss. Dread my dead tooth unmaking
the veil, dread the ointment I, dread the wound I, dread the wail I,
dread the johncrow’s eye, smoke of black clouds heralding
only dread. Skirmish of youth, my constant banner of dread.
Dread at home, dread to the bone, my father dangling his guillotine
of dread. Dread as daily bread. Nursed dark by decades of dread,
teachers recoiled at my knotted thorns of dread. How the white
girls blanched with dread. Scorned for the hair on my head.
Beware my Blackheart of dread, the reckless haunt of my dread,
girl born of nothing but salt-air and dread. Girl who bore nothing
but a vision of dread. Such a savage, dread. Thrum of the natty dread.
Congo Bongo dread. Martyred was the dread. Brother still the dread.
Blood of my dread. Babylon maiming families of dread, pastors railing
against our dread, dread the crown of heavens I wear upon this head. Dread
at the root, dread of the fruit. Sister of dread. Daughter of the dread.
First woman giving birth to her dread. A gorgon stoning every baldhead, dead."
Everyone Who Left Us,"Everyone who left us we find everywhere.
It’s easier, now, to look them in the eyes—
At gravesites, in bed, when the phone rings.
Of course, we wonder if they think of us.
It’s easier, now, to look them in the eyes,
Imagine touching a hand, listening to them talk.
Of course, we wonder if they think of us
When nights, like tonight, turn salty, warm.
Imagine touching a hand, listening to them talk—
Hard to believe they’re capable of such coldness.
When nights, like tonight, turn salty, warm,
We think of calling them, leaving messages.
Hard to believe they’re capable of such coldness—
No color, no pulse, not even a nerve reaction.
We think of calling them, leaving messages
Vivid with news we’re sure they’d want to know.
No color, no pulse, not even a nerve reaction:
We close our eyes in order not to see them.
Vivid with news, we’re sure they’d want to know
We don’t blame them, really. They weren’t cruel.
We close our eyes in order not to see them
Reading, making love, or falling asleep.
We don’t blame them. Really, they weren’t cruel,
Though it hurts every time we think of them:
Reading, making love, or falling asleep,
Enjoying the usual pleasures and boredoms.
Though it hurts every time we think of them,
Like a taste we can’t swallow their names stay.
Enjoying the usual pleasures and boredoms,
Then, they leave us the look of their faces
Like a taste we can’t swallow. Their names stay,
Diminishing our own, getting in the way
At gravesites, in bed, when the phone rings.
Everyone who left us we find everywhere,
Then they leave us, the look of their faces
Diminishing, our own getting in the way."
from Clangings,"I hear the dinner plates gossip
Mom collected to a hundred.
My friends say get on board,
but I’m not bored. Dad’s a nap
lying by the fire. That’s why
when radios broadcast news,
news broadcast from radios
gives air to my kinship, Dickey,
who says he’d go dead if ever
I discovered him to them.
I took care, then, the last time
bedrooms banged, to tape over
the outlets, swipe the prints
off DVDs, weep up the tea
stains where once was coffee.
Not one seep from him since.
What, you wander, do I mean?
Except for slinging my songs
wayward home, how do things
in people go? is what I mean."
Lackawanna,"My brain felt swiped clean.
I couldn’t love
songs I loved; friends came
nameless as mailmen …
A loaf of dough
forbidden to rise,
I’m slid into the hollow magnet.
Din of a dozen arcade games, but louder.
The MRI finds no sign
of stroke; the EEG, no fried circuitry.
Short-Term Temporal Lobe Seizure.
I’m told: forget it.
Forget my state of forgetfulness …
Was Dismal Harmony a childhood
wildlife preserve?—near tracks
where Lackawanna means
two streams meet and divide
in the tongue of an obliterated tribe."
Last Judgment,"Terrified past panic, strict lines collapsed,
their shredded flesh more wound than flesh,
they play dead in a ditch, but won’t give up
their shrouds, which have grown on them.
Then the angels come, oiling eye sockets, joints,
and stuffing everyone’s armpits, left or right,
with an item they failed to desecrate in life.
This way, something saved remains warm,
and God’s hands don’t get cold, as He sorts
the good ones from the ones who’ve spoiled."
Electric Guitar,"for Patti Boyd
Hollow body, solid body, Archtop, Strat, or Flying V,
my shape’s a pitted avocado; a frying egg, yolk broken;
or nearly any Braque; my dark sounds utter hyperbole,
as in Eric’s bottleneck falsetto to his Layla—formerly
George’s something all too much—her gold ringlets
bloating Slowhand’s bell-bottom jeans with Blues.

Plenty other muses teased voltage from my pickups,
but the duende she awoke could play, until who knew
whether I fed back through her or she through me? "
The Orchids,"translated from the Spanish by Alice Stone Blackwell
Freaks of bright crystal, airy beauties fair,
Whose enigmatic forms amaze the eye—
Crowns fit to deck Apollo’s brows on high,
Adornments meet for halls of splendor rare!
They spring from knots in tree-trunks, rising there
In sweet gradation; winding wondrously,
They twist their serpent stems, and far and nigh
Hang overhead like wingless birds in air.
Lonely, like pensive heads, all fetterless.
Lofty and free they bloom; by no dull chain
Their flowers to any tyrant root are bound;
Because they too, at war with pettiness,
Desire to live, like souls that know no stain,
Without one touch of contact with the ground.
    Las Orquídeas
     Caprichos de cristal, airosas galas
de enigmáticas formas sorprendentes,
diademas propias de apolíneas frentes,
adornos dignos de fastuosas salas.
   En los nudos de un tronco hacen escalas;
y ensortijan sus tallos de serpientes,
hasta quedar en la altitud pendientes,
á manera de pájaros sin alas.
   Tristes como cabezas pensativas,
brotan ellas, sin torpes ligaduras
de tirana raíz, libres y altivas;
   porque también, con lo mezquino en guerra,
quieren vivir, como las almas puras,
sin un solo contacto con la tierra . . ."
Oakland in Rain,"Years before ever seeing California, I wrote a story titled “Oakland in Rain.” 
Rain served as an easy metaphor for the unexpected in a place 
known for abundance, and it provided a texture of melancholy. 
The nameless protagonist—an exiled drunk who was, 
of course, a thinly veiled version of myself— 
had lost her mind and believed the weather communicated with her: 
rain meant soberness, that she had been absolved of some sort of punishment. 
Plagued by her wild inner life, I imagined her wandering the city, 
intent on getting lost in the Catholic cemeteries, where she took note  
of lemons in the wet grass (an offering?), the sky, a hawk on a tree. 
But no matter where she went, nothing was ever quiet enough. 
Despite my best efforts, the narrative was bleak; 
it lacked tension and a convincing resolution. 
Now, why am I telling you all this? Well, one day I woke up 
and it had been raining in the Oakland of my actual life. 
Outside my window, the cottonwood trees looked like the day before, 
but drops of water covered the few dead leaves that hadn’t fallen 
all the way down and were caught between branches. 
It felt foolish to consider my fate, the idea of premonition. 
Still, I put on my red coat and walked up the hill to the cemetery. 
As if I had invented it, there were lemons in the grass, palm trees 
with browned leaves. Walking there, between the gravestones of strangers, 
a runner passed me, and a family who had come to bring flowers, 
their faces animated, ruddy from the cold. And my life, I understood,  
was just like their lives—marked by ordinary rituals, exercise,  
and theories about the body. Nothing was as opulent as I had imagined it 
back then, but just as I had needed it—the meaning of it all cold  
and very still, like a marble pedestal engraved with an ancient, simple fact."
Fugal,"A shriek, dawn-like, birdless—an ordained
stratum—pulsing canticle of the numen. 
The chant coarsely flung at the bosky ridges 
of shattered clavicle—skull doused in lacquer. 
Hear into the negative of bone the annals of a hut,
lamina of guttural gowk. 
                                        Fluted brinks of obsidian 
cloaked dimly in canon—clamor, mist, shaping the glum 
worship. The rite of splay—to utter a corpse to dazzle—
entombing the nebulous flesh in funerary hum, a syllabic urn."
"Poems of Gustavo Adolfo Becquer, IX","Translated from the Spanish by Mason Carnes
Balmy breezes softly sighing,
     Kiss the light waves as they curl;
And the sun, albeit dying
     Kisses warm yon cloud of pearl;
For a kiss the flame is trying
     Round the burning log to whirl;
And the willow never misses
Giving back the river’s kisses!"
"Poems of Gustavo Adolfo Becquer, VII","Translated from the Spanish by Mason Carnes
In the dark corner of the drawing-room,
     Forgotten by its mistress long ago,
Silent, cover’d with dust there in the gloom
          The old harp lies.
How many notes slept in those strings half-dead
     And waited for her fingers, white as snow.
To wake them into throbbing life, that fled
          Away in sighs!
Ah me! thought I, how oft sleeps genius thus
     Deep in the soul, hoping eternally
A voice will say, as He to Lazarus,
          “Arise and walk.”—Ah me!"
"Poems of Gustavo Adolfo Becquer, IV","Translated from the Spanish by Mason Carnes
        Ah! do not say that, all its treasure spent,
        For lack of subjects mute the lyre has grown:
        Perchance no poets there will be, but still
                              For ever poetry will live.
While the waves enkindled by the kiss of light all palpitate,
While the sun adorns the broken clouds with robes of fire and gold;
While the air bears harmonies and perfumes in its ample lap,
While there is a spring to glad the world, there will be poetry!
While Science strives in vain to find the origin of life,
And in the sea or sky remains unsounded one abyss;
While mankind advancing ever knows not whither trend his steps,
While there is a mystery for man, there will be poetry!
While we feel the soul rejoicing with no laughter from the lips;
While we feel the soul lamenting with no tears to cloud the eye;
While the fiery heart continues battling with the sober head,
While there are remembrances and hopes, there will be poetry!
While there are some eyes reflecting other eyes that look at them,
While a sighing lip remains responsive to a lip that sighs,
While two blended, mingled souls can feel each other in a kiss,
While one beauteous woman still remains, there will be poetry!"
"Poems of Gustavo Adolfo Becquer, II","Translated from the Spanish by Mason Carnes
Flying arrow that darts astray,
   Shot at misfortune unforeseen,
   Without divining where its keen
Quivering edge will find its way;
Leaf that from the sapless tree
   Is ravished by the wild south wind,
   With none to know or care to find
The furrow where its end will be;
Gigantic wave,—which the tempest hurls
   And fiercely tosses upon the sea—
   That rolling and raging wantonly
Knows not the shore towards which it whirls;
Light that shines though death be nigh
   And burns in flickering circles small,
   Not knowing which among them all
Will flicker the last and trembling die;
Such am I. By chance I flow
   Into this troubled world unsought;
   I ebb away without a thought
Of whence I come or where I go."

"Poems of Gustavo Adolfo Becquer, LII","Translated from the Spanish by Mason Carnes
When from out our happy past
      The flying hours we call,
A tear-drop glitters upon your eye
      And trembles, just ready to fall.
And at length it falls at the thought that we both
      Shall return to lament alway,
As the day that is for the day that was
      And the day that's to come for to-day."
"Poems of Gustavo Adolfo Becquer, L","Translated from the Spanish by Mason Carnes
O waves gigantic that roaring break
And hurt yourselves on a desert strand,
Wrapt in a sheet of the foam you make
      Drag me below with you, bear me on high.
O hurricane, driving with whips of wind
The faded leaves from the forest grand,
Dragged along by the whirlwind blind
      Goad me to go with you, prone as I lie.
O clouds of the tempest, by light’ning kiss’d,
Your edges shot with the fire of its love,
Whirled long in the sombre mist
      Bear me away with you, bear me above.
O bear me away with you, bear me away
Where frenzied with vertigo mad I may slay
My reason and memory, for I fear
      To be left all alone with my sorrow here."
"Poems of Gustavo Adolfo Becquer, XLI","Translated from the Spanish by Mason Carnes
I put the light aside, and sat me down
Upon the edge of the disorder’d bed;
At the blank wall I gazed, immovable,
             Mute, sombre, like the dead.
And how long was I there? I do not know;
When grief’s dull drunkenness was leaving me,
The light was out and on my balconies
             The sun laughed gleefully.
Nor do I know in those dread hours of what
I thought or what mad passions through me roll’d;
But I remember that I wept and curst,
             And that, ere morning came, I had grown old."
"Poems of Gustavo Adolfo Becquer, XXXV","Translated from the Spanish by Mason Carnes
If, in a book, of all our wrongs
      The story should be traced,
And in our souls, as on its leaves,

I love you so, your love has left
      Such traces in my breast,
That were you to blot out one wrong,
      I'd blot out all the rest!"
"Poems of Gustavo Adolfo Becquer, LX","Translated from the Spanish by Mason Carnes
From a dark corner of the mind
       Past memories
Fly to beset me, like a swarm
       Of angry bees.
Attacked, surrounded, ’tis in vain
       I try to fling.
Them off; each thrusts into my soul
       Its poisoned sting."
"Poems of Gustavo Adolfo Becquer, LIX","Translated from the Spanish by Mason Carnes
Trembling comes the dawn at first, and scarcely dares to pierce the night,
Then it sparkles, grows, expanding in a burning burst of light.
Light is joy, the fearful shadows are the griefs that on me weigh.
Ah! upon my spirit’s darkness when will come the dawn of day?"
"Poems of Gustavo Adolfo Becquer, LIV","Translated from the Spanish by Mason Carnes
        It is not strange this framework here
        Of skin and bones at last has grown
        So loath to bear my madcap brain;
        ’Tis true I am not old and sere,
        But from the cup of life I own
        I drink so eagerly the pain,
        A century of life, I’d say,
        I’ve fused and poured into each day.
        And so to-day were I to die.
        That I have lived I’d not deny;
        Without the house seems new and gay,
        Within live ruin and decay.
Decay sits there, alas!   His wizened face
My sorrow ever mirrors to me now:
For there’s a grief that passing stamps its trace
Deep in the heart, if not upon the brow."
"Poems of Gustavo Adolfo Becquer, XXV","Translated from the Spanish by Mason Carnes
When sleep folds his gauzy wings
Over you at dead of night,
And your eye-lashes fast-closed
Look like bows of ebony;
Then to listen to your heart
Throbbing in a sweet unrest
And to lean your sleeping head
On my breast, I’d give, my soul,
All I own—light, air and thought!
When your eyes look far away
At something invisible,
And the reflex of a smile
Darts, illumining your lips;
Then to read upon your brow
Silent thoughts, that pass like clouds
O’er a glass, I’d give, my soul,
All I wish—fame, genius, gold!
When words die upon your lips,
And your breath comes quick and warm,
And your cheeks are all aglow
And your black eyes look in mine;
Then to see in them a spark,
Flashing with a humid fire,
As it gushes from the heart,
I would give, soul of my soul,
All that is and all to come!"
"Poems of Gustavo Adolfo Becquer, XXIV","Translated from the Spanish by Mason Carnes
Two blood-red tongues of fire
That, circling the same log,
Approach and as they kiss
Form but a single flame;
Two notes, plucked cunningly
Together from the lute,
That meet in space in sweet
Harmonious embrace;
Two waves that come to die
Together on the beach
And, as they’re breaking, crown
Themselves with silver crest;
Two sinuous curls of smoke
That rise from out the lake
And, as they meet there in
The sky, form one white cloud;
Two thoughts that equally
Gush out; two kisses blent;
Two echoes mingling e’er,—
Like these are our two souls!"
"Poems of Gustavo Adolfo Becquer, XVI","Translated from the Spanish by Mason Carnes
If, when the bell-flow’rs on your balcony
              All trembling line,
You think it is the sighing, murmuring wind
              That passes by,
Know that, hidden among the green leaves there,
              For you I sigh.
If, when behind you echoing on your ear
              Vague murmurs fall,
You think some far-off voice has called you, know
              That from the pall
Of evening shadows that surround you, love,
              To you I call.
If in the dead of night your timorous heart
              Beats fast, while near
Your lips you feel a passionate, burning breath,
              Ah! have no fear.
Know that, although invisible, I breathe
              Beside you, dear."
"Poems of Gustavo Adolfo Becquer, LVIII","Translated from the Spanish by Mason Carnes
When the sleepless fever comes
And the hours creep slowly by,
On the border of my bed
      Who will sit beside me?
When my thin and trembling hand
I stretch out—about to die—
Longing for a friendly hand,
      Who will grasp it tightly?
When my eyes are glazed by death
Eyes that ne’er again will see—
Should my eyelids open stay,
      Who will close them kindly? 
When they sound the funeral bell
(If a knell be tolled for me),
Hearing it, a gentle prayer
      Who will murmur softly?
When my body lies at rest
In the bosom of the earth,
O’er the soon-forgotten grave
      Who will come to mourn me?
When the sun returns to shine
On the morrow, in their mirth
That I passed once through this world
      Who will e’er remember?"

To Leonora,"translated from the Spanish by Alice Stone Blackwell
Black as the wing of Mystery thine hair,
Dark as a “Never” where deep sorrow lies,
As a farewell, or as the words “Who knows?”
Yet is there something darker still—thine eyes!
Two musing wizards are those eyes of thine;
Sphinxes asleep in shadow in the South;
Two beautiful enigmas, wondrous fair;
Yet is there something fairer still—thy mouth!
Thy mouth! Ah, yes! Thy mouth, divinely formed
For love’s expression and to be love’s goal,
Shaped for love’s warm communion—thy young mouth! 
Yet is there something better still—thy soul.
Thy soul, retiring, silent, brimming o’er 
With pity and with tenderness, I deem
Deep as the ocean, the unsounded sea; 
Yet is there something deeper still—thy dream!

    Tus ojos son dos magos pensativos,
dos esfinges que duermen en la sombra,
dos enigmas muy bellos . . . Pero hay algo,
pero hay algo más bello aún: tu boca.
    ¡Tu boca! ¡oh, sí!; tu boca, hecha divina-
mente para el amor, para la cálida
comunión del amor, tu boca joven;

Floating veil of misty light,
Ribbon curl’d of foam snow-white,
Cadence bold from harp of gold,
Wave of light and kiss of breeze,—
            Such are you!
You, an airy shade that flees
When I try its form to seize;
Vanishing like flame o’erthrown,
Like the fog and murmured moan
            From a lake of blue.
Wave on shoreless sea, a trace
Of a meteor through space,
Long desire for something higher,
Deep lamenting of the wind,
            Such am I!
I, who in my pain will find
Toward your own my eyes inclined,
I, who mad and tireless run
After shadows of the sun,
            Visions floating by!"
"Poems of Gustavo Adolfo Becquer, XIV","Translated from the Spanish by Mason Carnes
I saw you but an instant, yet your eyes
Image themselves before mine own and rise
And float, like that dark spot, mantled in blaze
Which floats and blinds, when on the sun you gaze.
Wherever I may look, I do but turn
To see your glowing eyes that flash and burn;
But ’tis not you that I encounter, for
It is your look alone, your eyes—no more!
I see them in the corner of my room
Wildly and strangely shining in the gloom;
And even when I sleep I feel them there
Wide-open, fix’d on me with steady stare.
I know that there are will-o’-the-wisps that fly
Before the traveller, leading him to die;
Your eyes draw me along; I feel ’tis so,
But yet I know not whither they would go."

The air-beams invisible wings unfold
      And restlessly glowing soar over the earth,
The heavens melt into rays of gold,
     While the earth is trembling with nervous mirth.
I close my eyes and I hear, spell-bound,
     A cadence of kisses, a beating of wings
In billows of harmony floating around;—
’Tis Love that passes, while Nature sings!"
Poems of Gustavo Adolfo Becquer LXXII,"Translated from the Spanish by Mason Carnes
Is it true that from its prison
    In swift flight our spirit slips,
When sweet sleep our drooping eyelids
    With his rosy fingers tips?
Is it true our soul at midnight,
    Borne on wings of breezes fleet,
Mounts into the spaceless ether,
    There with other souls to meet?
Is it true our naked spirit,
    With no earthly fetters fraught,
For a while goes freely roaming
    In the silent world of thought?
That it keeps the stain of passions––
    Joys that bloom and woes that blight––
Like the track left in the heavens
    By a meteor in flight?"
Poems of Gustavo Adolfo Becquer LXVI,"Translated from the Spanish by Mason Carnes
At the flash of a light we are born; we are dead
Ere its splendor refulgent is sped,–—

For glory and love that we ardently court
Are but shades of a dream that floats by;—

How beautiful it is to see the day
Arising, crowned with fire, the waves that play,–—

The air enkindled by the kiss of light!
Late in an autumn day, when rain-drops cloy
The flowers, how sweet and beautiful the joy
               To have your being fed
Upon their perfume till it’s surfeited!
Upon a winter’s eve, when silently
The snow-flakes fall, how beautiful to see
               The reddish tongues of great
And massive flames timidly palpitate!
When softly drowsiness begins to creep
Upon you, oh, how sweet it is to sleep!

Ourselves! A pity ’tis, ’tis not enough!"

That there existed something infinite
To her who swore to me eternal love.
To-day I call on it in vain; I hear

You are not able e’en to suffer pain
Eternally, poor miserable clay!"
Juggler,"Translated from the Filipino by Kristine Ong Muslim
Swapping seven balls with his palm,
and with air. Precision inhabits the gap
between the ball’s trajectory and its anticipated
pace at the brink of hesitation—
the arc of descent. How does one grasp making
sense of timing when to hurl and when to catch?
Is it when one rehearses alone or when one rehearses
being alone? Which one holds
when there is no break from motion,
and from emotion? They thought, he makes gravity.
Then in a blink of an eye, oh! the balls are dropped.
They have yet to stop holding their breath.
    Salitan ng pitong bola sa kanyang palad,
at sa hangin. May presisyon sa pagitang
tahak ng bola ang landas o ng landas ang bola
sa ritmong nasa talukap ng alanganin—
lagi sa pagkahulog. Saan inaaral ang pasya
ng pandama sa sandali ng pag-itsa at pagsalo?
Sa pag-iisa sa pag-eensayo o sa pag-eensayo
sa pag-iisa? Alin ang nasa kamay
habang walang humpay ang mosyon,
at emosyon? Wari nila, lalang niya ang grabedad.
At sa minsang pagkurap, ay! mangangalaglag ang bola.

                 but harm is already the background,
        a hum attuned, though we are not, to
the recent hue: his face becoming gradually blued
        the way, if you watch, in slow evening-time, distant
                mountains will somehow purple-up,
        but closer, like indigo velvet in the box
beneath his Navy Flying Cross,
        a little darkling sea in there, patriotic, roiling…
                Foiled, his hours
        trundle, lurch, or, more likely, creep
moss-slow. Think how that must feel
        —at sundown, say, stand in his room,
                cock your brain just so, and day
        ignites: through venetian blinds, a huge
doctor-headlamp in the face of all,
        the tunnel-end of all,
                the holy All we quailed at, formerly,
        but now, as the wrench of ownership pulls
his face from the lovelinesses he spent
        seven decades seeing, find
               we are going to face. About face:
        in the trawled-through afternoon’s
minnowy, shadowy exigencies we say the names of
        mother, father, wife, daughter, daughter,
               and each one bounces off until
        his pillow is littered with family tree tinder
without which the brain’s little scout-fire
               cannot even hope to start.
               For that is what His Cogency wants from us,
        isn’t it?

               Again: Kneel. Bellow. Blow. Again:"
Early Instance,"Once, the violin maker bent
so close and for so long to beauty
he almost saw the saw as it ravished his hand.
But now, his three fingers light up her face
—here-, here-here-here—
amid the forest of primitive instruments
—horn and crumhorn, lute and three-holed flute—
branching from hooks along the walls
of his one room.
This maker makes her sad.
Or good. Or safe. Or steady.
Or briefly steadfast in his birdfoot hand.
And after, since she asks, 
he plays one of his fiddles for her,
tucking it under his right ear,
bowing with what is left of his left hand,
letting the joyful spider the right fingers make
loose to spell and spell the thing she still can feel…
But not till decades later will she sense herself as music.
And what will bring her to it will be a need for solace 
beyond the human kind."

Good Morning Heartache,"That bastard sun rises again, dissolving

My waking mind feels for hope, blind
reach for eyeglasses on the nightstand
or an oxygen regulator fallen
from my mouth to the ocean floor.
Across town, my friend can’t lift her head
off her pillow, the chemo eating her
platelets and maybe the tumor, while
in my kitchen, the coffee timer clicks on,
French Roast draining into the carafe.

the plum saplings he planted

crepe myrtles outside her home
blaze, impotent red blooms.
When she phones, he will talk
only about the plums, how
sweet they will taste, sliced
and salted, on his favorite plate. "
Notes on Sentence Crossing,"Let it be an unruly one—an unplucked ass hair—not collagen but spite—not to live to
annihilate other living things—just to receive—I live to sieve—she says—who says—I
say now to her—I say now I admire the melodrama of this particular moment of
your suffering recorded—it was so cold that day, mom—and how did you do it—
how did you survive the baby off-cycling nocturnal so you were up all night—and
the language how did you survive that too— 
My little girl’s mouth is shaped like a tulip—her lip wiggles and the electrons in her
brain crackle like tin foil when she thinks—which is all of the time—I won’t let them
grind her up into meat—not today—they’d separate her into buckets and dispose of
her personality—and when she asks—what does she ask—could I feel the rupture-
swell in the syntax the bead of blood like a ruby—well of course you have a
personality I say to her—it was not to annihilate other living things—
I walked through the city with my moo-moo colors—hanging off my left arm—and
the habit I had was to speculate about when darkness would descend—thinking
about the hydroponically grown herbs that he loves—they dismiss him as their
owner—and this is how it goes with pets and children—they walk with you through
this forever-year—this distortion-spring—this element of toxicity falling like snow
through the air—or it was snowing real snow which is a kind of ash—I felt so weak
in my feather tuxedo—of ultramarine—"
The Flock,"That there are too many birds—I know this already.
But the buckshot-pierced dove’s open mouth
echoed my lover’s sleep-slackened jaw, so I
covered its body with leaves and swore off
my rifle forever. And if I decided love was possible
because her eyelashes iridesced like peacock feathers,
so be it. If a house sparrow arrives on my sill,
sprig of language pinched in her beak, who am I
to tell her no? The first time I saw the plastic owl
perched on my San Francisco rooftop, I circled
the building three times, awed by the fog-hazed
visitation. The window-stunned robin who hunkered
on my deck for hours—that she flew away meant
one thing, that she left a red stain meant another. "
I Have No Answer But Stones,"Who will walk / Between me and the crying of the frogs?
—Edna St. Vincent Millay

Either you believe, or you don’t, my friend says. Which is it?
We’re parked on the dirt road in darkness, beer bottles balanced

on the hood of her truck. It’s Passover, and I’m speaking in stories again,
counting them out like drops of wine on a white serving plate:

one for blood, two for frogs. In the bog below the hill the peepers
weave a net of their shrieking; they cinch the night’s throat taut.

How to say I believe most in the power of what I do not know,
secondly in the power of that which I can hold in a closed fist?

We collect stones from the road by headlamp. My friend likes
purple ones best. This is how I learned to carry stories, to tuck them

into my pocket, familiar weight chafing my thigh—
what my ancestors must have carried, shuffling toward exile.

A story pressed onto a child’s tongue is not the same as bread,
but it will suffice for a time. Before me a woman bends under her bundle.

From the bundle a thin string of rice keeps pouring over the street…
I think of nothing, wrote fourteen-year-old Yitzchak Rudashevski in his diary

the day the Jews were herded from Vilna. What does one haul with
a body that doesn’t know its own ghosts? If the stories clink like stones

at the bottom of my empty sack, they give me a rhythm to walk by.
If they rattle bones or doorknobs on nights as dark as this one,

I know I’ll let them in. Listen, I tell my friend, then stop.
I have no answer. I drink more beer. I load my pockets with more

and larger stones. Each year the frogs shrill a tower of glass
to the top of the sky. Each year they scream until it shatters us."
What Will You Do at the End of the World?,"When I watch the video where the violinist plays
as surgeons cut the cancer from her brain,
my first impulse is to descend into metaphor—
to imagine the plaintive cry of her violin as a singular
silvery thread that leads the surgeons—sublimely,
tremulously—through the Minotaur’s maze,
so they can extract the tumor abutting the lobe
that controls her left hand, so they can navigate
the fleshy labyrinthine folds and electric shocks
that make a human mind. When I watch her bow
graze the ventilator tube again and again,
I want to recall the old story of Nero playing
as Rome burned, which is supposed to be a story
about callous cruelty and ineffectual leadership,
but which fails to hold up under historic scrutiny
for many reasons, including that the violin
was not invented until the 11th century.
Still, the fable lends him more humanity than not—
the notion that there was music inside him,
even if it took six days of burning to fan it out,
a music so powerful it forced itself to escape
his tyrant’s mouth. If art is only pleasure,
Nero’s act is selfish, loathsome, but if art is survival—
a violin’s siren might morph to beacon
against the smoky air. I keep asking my poems
what the world needs from me in these days
of quickening dread, of burgeoning conflagration,
what they want me to do. In the comments section
below the hospital video, no one can agree
on what they’re seeing: Creepy, incredible,
horrifying, beautiful. Afterward, the violinist recalls,
I kept thinking, Get out of my way. I need to play louder."
Elegy for My Grandmother in the Form of a Cactus,"The way each linked lobe of your cactus swallows all
the green from the one before it, reminds me of that movie
about the human centipede and how appalled you’d have been
to know such a film exists, though you were no stranger
to the macabre, you who used to warn me not to drink tea
too much or my stomach would swell red, you said,
citing the story of that man with the shotgun wound
in his abdomen, how he became a medical curiosity
for the dark deep hole in him through which the world
could suddenly view the innermost sanctum of a human body,
which was a long way you had of saying it matters what we put
inside ourselves. I have put so many things inside myself I should
not have: smoke of all sorts, whiskey, sorrow, pennies, bottomless
guilt, river stones, a crusty work glove pulled off with my teeth.
I even licked a Burmese python once. I list the contraband
of my body to myself as I eat nachos or frozen French fries
off your blue dinner plates, counting the indulgences
I imagine you would not have approved. And here I am now,
inserting a gross horror movie reference into a poem
about your absence, a poem I began writing only because
I wanted you to know: your cactus is flowering again,
as it has four years now, fuchsia flames licking out
from the maw of each final green—I don’t know what to call it,
not a leaf, but a section of stem pressed flat—until yes,
it erupts into firework, a tongue or tail of brightness uncurling
into this winter room. I wanted you to know: it flowered
the night you died. It flowered because I told it to,
you in your hospital bed and me not there. And now
I force it unconsciously each year, forget to water
for months then soak it with the thawed remains
of yesterday’s chicken pail. It’s an Easter cactus really,
I wanted you to know. I looked it up on a diagram today—
the three shapes of lobe—but yours is willful, peculiar, blooms
only in late January, blooms only for you. Which is fitting,
since we don’t believe in resurrection, you or I. Just another
flattened green segment each year, another stubborn
explosion of beauty at the end of our grief."
Masters and Lovers,"They say Scheherazade saved all women with storytelling
I can’t even save myself before sunrise
I feel like I’m down
there with him
pushing against
what hurts most
He shows me around his house
where a woman set herself on fire
and the walls remained unharmed
Here the ghosts slowly drag me
here the ashes mix with dust
with the smile of       a wolf-grandma
he pretends not to        hear her silence
“I thought you                 like it that way,”
he tells Scheherazade,       gives her children,


spreads across time,                 his specters in the world."
South Side (V),"To those who come after, this is the law of the town—
the South Side is not a place, but a state of being,
a song, the candy lady circling around
the blocks with walking tacos, Kool-Aid unfreezing
in Styrofoam cups. Happiness costs so little
for those who are willing to buy. And everyone
has a name; the man who drives the ice-cream truck, the nickel-
and-dime bag boys with Frootie Rolls lining one
side of their jackets’ insides—Mr. Bradley,
Joshua ’nem, their presence steady as statues.
How much of this city is flavor? The thick and sappy
taste of too sweet, too quick to melt, the cashew
crunch of Garrett popcorn mix? It’s sensory;
the act of remembering, of making memory."
Tender-Headed,"I resume my Saturday night post
between stretchmarks,
shoulders caught between chestnut
thighs as Grandma greases my scalp.
She carmines the nape of my neck
with her rattail comb, the one
with gaps where my naps
wrestled and won.
The coffee table muddles with jars
of gel and rubber bands that welted
her thumbs when they snapped,
my backside numb on the living room
carpet, dahlia fibers honeycombing
my skin through my oversized tee.
Be still now, and I strain
against her grip on my roots,
chawing tongue to check my
mewls, focusing on the click
of her short nails colliding
as she plaits piece over piece.
She hums “For Your Glory,”
parts my hair into sections,
gridding out old city streets
and rows of cotton;
I wonder if she braids my hair
for the pastor’s approval
or God’s—they’d never say."

go escape while you can go escape
buy tickets for the last water train
which as it subsides reveals
curbs pavements the riverside
the anatomy of the sinewy city that lies
naked and unfamiliar like a man in your bed
go—escape while you can
 
take all your belongings
everything that’s yours
split lips cut knees
the cracked jar of a head from which
memory slowly seeps and all you can
leave just leave behind
the evening lights in the windows
the beloved exposed throat of the sky
the smell of the subway the lead of the river
 
go and don’t come back have no doubts that’s how it is
to fall into the bottomless well of a body
to throw yourself like a comb over your shoulder
to sow yourself across a field so that a host

"Conversion: On Cincinnati’s Converted Churches, God, and Lucifer","I.
The other day I almost felt the burden
of sin in Urban Outfitters (church of markups, house
of worship for pretenders, the suburban
teens masquerading as city-born). A blouse
on a rack arrests the gem-light from the rose
window, anemic sunlight dribbling through
stained glass, re-pressing new designs. Transpose
Jesus onto the Grateful Dead, skeletons toe-
to-toe and Our Lord and Savior kneeling, washing
their metatarsals. The mannequins wear
it better here, their pseudo-sockets watching
me mime their poses. Fiberglass arms bare
in tank tops. Legs half-lunging. One foot en pointe
like a disciple’s, for me to kiss. Anoint.
II.
Like a disciple, for me to kiss (anoint)
your face is to mark you for betrayal. Coffee
cups and carafes, my lipstick print disjoined
from the trellised skin—I leave behind a copy
of my mouth at cafés. I find a shop that sells
lattes and tea in the sanctuary, plays
old rap songs that would clatter like shotgun shells
in a Sunday service’s silence. During the weekdays,
the college kids forget themselves and burn
their tongues on dark roasts, mochas spilled, say shit
and cross themselves with a caffeinated finger-
gun to the head, the chest, the shoulders. I sit
and mouth the Father, Son, the Holy Spirit
with every touch, on beat, like a rap song lyric.
III.
With every touch—on beat like a rap song lyric—
my phone works less and less. The telltale check
of Verizon Wireless bums on its side; a satyric
smirk in vermillion, devil-red. At the tech
desk, the employee tests my touchscreen sensors.
He says, It’s almost gone, you’ll need to upgrade.
I let him rob me. His voice resounds from the center
of the store as if he’s preaching the terms of the trade-
in, rules like commandments. Forty dollars a month
to hear another voice, for someone other
than God to speak to me. One hundred up front
to kill the loneliness, to call my mother
some days. Siri records and keeps my confession;
Forgive me, Father, for all our missed connections.
IV.
Forgive me, Father, for all our missed connections—
my late-night pillow-prayer. I’ve avoided
going to church for months now, my collection
of excuses practiced, preached right back. I’m loaded
with bullshit, Sunday morning sermons spent
in bed, damning myself for sleeping too late.
But I never set the alarm. At night, I repent
by kneeling bedside, all my body’s weight
branding my knees with the carpet’s pattern.
My comforter clings to the dryer’s heat. I say
Let me explain, Lord, but it doesn’t matter.
We’ve been here before—last week, the other day
when my tongue played Judas and betrayed me, slipped
and cursed mid-prayer, abandoned the usual script.
V.
And cursed! Mid-prayer! Abandoned the usual script
again—you, venting to your angels, another
tally in red by my name. A sinner’s lip
on that one. I picture you watching me stutter
another apology. Your angels gather
around to eavesdrop and gossip about my judgment
day. What would you say if you heard the scattered
chitchat, your cherubs deep in their discussion
about my devil-speak? Have I sent angels
to punishment with this mouth? Cartoonish
really—you pointing like a parent, the painful
silence that follows Go to your room. Their moonish
eyes closed, hands clasped in prayer, asking you
for forgiveness. I hear angels mess up too.
VI.
For forgiveness, I hear angels mess up too.
My grandma tells me, An angel fell from heaven
because he started “smelling himself,” her new
expression. Probably ruined it the second
he got up there. I wonder if all my dreams
of falling are really just me losing
your favor and forgetting. To me it seems
that life is a game of this-or-that, of choosing
to deny the self or indulge. My grandma reminds
me it’s never black and white, but different shades
of gray. It ain’t easy being human. Sometimes
we fail a test, or we pass. There ain’t no grades
for that. Everyone sins. Lucifer even, falling
to hell, the heat beneath us licking. Sprawling.
VII.
To hell, the heat. Beneath us—licking, sprawling—
sunlight unfurling on the asphalt. My mother
and I amble through an outlet mall, sweat stalling
in the underwire of our bras. I smother
her hand in mine, wrestle her into air-
conditioning in Forever 21.
She fans herself with a coupon flyer, her hair
flapping in waves. I make a fleeting run
through the markdowns, neon tags for clearance, half
off. An employee asks if I need assistance
when I hold a shirt to my chest—its skeleton laughs,
a bouquet of roses in its mouth, its twisted
grin in on all my secrets, my darker version.
The other day I almost felt the burden."
Women of the 1980s,They came from the municipalities  the cantones  the in between  children of campesinos  day laborers  drudges. They crossed water and deserts and left children  elders  husbands. They were children  lovers  spouses  mothers  elders  vagabond escapists. They prayed in the back of trucks so hard the virgin mother revealed herself at checkpoint to offer the miracle crossing of another boundary. Something was happening to them. So much had happened where they left. They changed the swelling cities but the cities changed them. They gathered burn marks  bruises on their arms in kitchens  in hotels  in other homes. They hid their names behind other names. They learned and did not learn new language. They crossed themselves waiting for buses  car rides  late night  early in the morning. They entered apartments at twilight where they laid beside sisters  friends  lovers. What were they dreaming as they slipped into their kitten heels  hair cut short  madonna-like lips painted red  dancing in the discotecas  downtown  uptown   outside the loop. They guarded pictures in their purses. They guarded themselves. They married for love  married without it  and they did not marry. And they loved  they learned  and they did not love. Learned to find and tuck themselves into their secret seams. The many things they would not tell their children. With illicit seeds they grow what they left behind  among the brush  little stems  memorials  now adornments at their windows.
Tropical Town,"For Miss Eugenia L. V. Geisenheimer
Blue, pink, and yellow houses, and, afar,
The cemetery, where the green trees are.
Sometimes you see a hungry dog pass by,
And there are always buzzards in the sky.
Sometimes you hear the big cathedral bell,
A blindman rings it; and sometimes you hear
A rumbling ox-cart that brings wood to sell.
Else nothing ever breaks the ancient spell
That holds the town asleep, save, once a year,
The Easter festival . . .
                                                I come from there,
And when I tire of hoping, and despair
Is heavy over me, my thoughts go far,
Beyond that length of lazy street, to where 
The lonely green trees and the white graves are."
Home,"I awaken to the sound of a rooster crowing,
the smell of fresh-brewed coffee.
I flash
back to my childhood. I am in the same
house. The same feelings flood
over me, take me back sixty years.
The Last Supper on the wall
Grandkids smile from the refrigerator door.
The house is still the same house.
At this table, the same table, in this kitchen,
I cut my quinceañera cake.
At this table in this house, the same house,
we sat talking after my father’s death,
after Bueli’s death,
after Tino’s death, and
before
important events—
weddings, births, trips.
The legs of the table sustain us still.
Furniture is necessary context
for life in and out of doors.
Pat the windowsill.
Cry a tear of joy or sadness
in this house. The same house.
The very same house.
Our home."
Bullfight,"I am the bull dragged
across a sandy bullring in Cancún,
a carcass, spent and bled to death.
The tourists—Japanese, German, Chicano, and even gringos—
don’t know they just witnessed a travesty, they cheer
a gutted ritual. No honor. No glory.
I gave my life for this?
When I was poked and raced into the ring,
I moved just so,
escaped the ribbon marker.
“Saltillero” me nombraron,
a worthy name, an honorable name.
Puny men tease me,
poke and try to anger me.
They fail.
The banderillero, big as a bull,
rides a horse, poor beast of burden;
pokes and fails.
The sharp knife enters swiftly,
and I know what’s coming. Feel it
as sure as I breathe,
with nostrils wide, huffing.
I see dark pink—the matador’s cape,
      shiny sequins in black and white.
I am color-blind, you say.
So I’ve heard, but I assure you I hear the color,
smell the red of blood and the brown of sun-bronzed skin.
Movement I must follow;
perplexed and tired, I sniff the earth,
following my scent
to the source of death.
He bends, and I hear, “Olé.”
I flick an ear,
the right, then the left;
I flick my tail.
I stand calmly,
appear not interested,
then I follow through
to my imminent end.
The crowd roars and stands;
I lie and die
on a Wednesday afternoon
en Cancún.
Red with beer and sun,
the tourists cheer
amid the stench of blood and sweat.
It’s five o’clock
on a Wednesday in Cancún.
I die."
Cunning,"Translated from the Spanish by the author
To Santa Elena
Cunningly you embroiled me
in your tangled life.
Your legend follows me from Spain.
The Jews and the Gypsies,
those of good and evil.
You follow me to Laredo and the matachines
dancing to a cross bedecked with flowers,
la cruz verdadera que tú
encontraste a tu manera.
No te dejaste engañar.
¡Tú sabias la verdad!
Ay Elena, such cleverness!
You arrived at this my town
of sunny afternoons with unexpected rain showers
on the Day of the Holy Cross
in Laredo al barrio de la Ladrillera.
The drum me llama
y el corazón responde.
    Astucia
  A Santa Elena
Con que astucia
me enredaste in your enmarañada vida
y tu leyenda me sigue desde España
y los judíos, los gitanos,
las gentes de bien y de mal,
hasta Laredo y matachines
danzando a la cruz vestida de flores,
the true cross you
found. You wouldn’t let anyone
fool you.
You knew the truth!
Ay, Elena, ¡qué astucia la tuya!
Llegaste hasta este mi pueblo
de tardes de mayo,
soleadas con lloviznas inesperadas,
en día de fiesta de la Santa Cruz,
en Laredo al barrio de la Ladrillera.
La tambora beats out a call
and my heart answers."
Border Bullets,"Rio Grande flows
from the Rockies to the Gulf

a packed train speeds by
transports precious cargo

What I Am In My Kitchen,"Yeast rises from nonna’s breadboard
under palm heels coaxing dough. I think mince and mash,
sauté and stew, sift and fold, spatulas and spoons. 
Knives, dependable as good clocks, 
ease through fish and eggs, chop onions
into dice, peppers into rings, meat into slices.

With metal-laced whips, I coax
snowy mounds, foam and froth;
butter and cream evolve into peaks.
Sprinkle and dash, tad and cup, a smidgen, 
I grate and grind, zing zest in air, flip and sift, 
know roux from glaze or simmer.
Ribbons of basil and thyme, snips of rosemary 
slip into sauces with solid support from parsley 
unleashed into the marriage of oil and garlic, 
marination of tarragon and vinegar.  I know
food’s language, the way dill tucks itself
so well into humus, sour cream, or salad,
the ménage of rosemary, sage and savory; cinnamon, 
clove and nutmeg; how hands find their way,
unafraid of cardamom and coriander, fennel and bay. 
I remember mother’s sauces, meringues, melt 
of her teacakes; nonna and her pots, heavy 
and true, her dice of avocado and artichoke 
in salads, her palm measuring salt,  
its immutable truth, its briny clip 
in the mouth, its promise to preserve.  "
Doppelgänger,"Translated from the Spanish by Roque Raquel Salas Rivera
I did not come to solitude
she packed my suitcase and said go.
She put an egg in my suitcase
she put leavening in my suitcase
she put salt in my suitcase
flour, sugar, and warm water.
I came to my mother’s house to sleep for days.
I closed all the doors.
I took off my clothes, my watches.
I left the suitcase on the floor unopened.
Now hungry,
with my eyes I rummage through the things I brought.
They have taken everything.
All that’s left is the egg, there, intact
beside the bed
and, when facing the mirror,
I feel strangely committed to its care.
    Doppelgänger
  No vine a la soledad
ella empacó mi maleta y dijo vete.
Puso un huevo en mi maleta
puso levadura en mi maleta
puso sal en mi maleta
harina, azúcar y agua tibia.
Vine a casa de mi madre a dormir días.
Cerré todas las puertas.
Me quité la ropa y los relojes.
Dejé la maleta sobre el suelo sin abrirla.
Ahora hambriento
rebusco con los ojos lo que traje.
Se han llevado todo.
Queda sólo el huevo, ahí, intacto
a un lado de la cama
y siento ante el espejo
el compromiso raro de cuidarlo."
In a Season of Absence,"We plowed under the familiar
with the blackened basil leaves.
Now abandoned recipes wait
on the counter. Here is the absence
of cinnamon and sage, biscotti
and wine. Shadows settle
into empty chairs around this table
where no candlesticks soften
the room. Plants sent to hold us up
crowd this space. In the peace plant,
a cobra arches its hooded head.
The single gardenia lifts its odor
to everything unanswered. Night
is silent, except the echo of a seed
in its hollow pod. We stare
through the window, trolling
an empty sky, black as the earth
our feet tamped back into place.
Stars do not feed the masses.
The wilderness has found us out.
Darkness widens our pupils."
Site Specific,"                  1)
The work goes here:
                               Judas recedes, lines realign, Christopher Smart
loved God through his cat, George Herbert with words in shapes,
and Jacopo Robusto detto Tintoretto through feats of geometry and oils.
He painted The Footwashing for one church wall; seen from the end of the gallery
as if walking up the church side aisle, perspective corrects and sweeps
and Jesus, sleeves rolled like the butcher or tanner, comes foreground,
kneeling to wash between Peter’s toes. But it goes wrong for me
when it goes right. I like the parts. The front and center retraction
of the neat story. That’s where, at the Prado, we stood,
looked right to see Jesus reverse his typical blessing gesture,
pointing down at a foot. Turned our heads to decide
the disciples, who tumbled on the tiles to wrestle stuck britches
off each other’s scrawny legs, were soused. Ewer. Cloak.
Foreground hound of modest yet elegant mien, curling paws.
At the communal table, bleary guy in drizzling beard listens
to the other guy’s moral disputations. And, magically simultaneous
in the back side room, like a detail box in a news graphic,
drawing us closer and closer to the big event,
tiny Last Supper. While close to the water on the main stage,
a weary apostle slumps against a pillar, halo kindled, fiddlingly
counts on his fingers or rehearses devotions or maybe tries to write gospel
with thumb on palm, forgetting he doesn’t have ink or an inkling.
And all this goes down each scene unfolding in its own separate cell.
You or I used to say, finding Judas in narrative paintings
is like Where’s Waldo, takes awhile but once you see you can’t unsee him.
I or you said, to find Judas in New Testament crowd scenes, look for the coin purse.
Tintoretto’s Judas looms far left, unlacing a sandal, adjunct to the parable,
going along with Jesus’s latest Jesus-show, money pouch half concealed
in one of his hands, body hooked like his nose, standard bit
of seventeenth-century Venetian-style Jew-hate. Kneecap like a bowl of mashed potatoes.
I get too close, lose the thread, grab at whatever lets me lose the point.
Digression, said Calvino, is for putting off the ending…perpetual evasion or flight.
Flight from what? From death of course….
                                                           The seeing all the way to the paint
as paint and the paint in pieces, in lumps, streaks and in ridges.
Judas is bald but for a haze of stubble, as if the hair had been burnt away.
                    2)
It turns out ashes are very light and heavier than I expected—turns out
others have noticed this: About the weight, they say, surely horseshit,
you were at birth. As if as ashes you’ve corrected back.
I wish you could read this poem and tell me what’s too, how to correct
or de-correct correction. Before you died, when you couldn’t help or move yourself,
I lifted you a lot, began to feel your weight as other than what I knew before,
other ways with your body. And lost my earlier knowing—
                                                                                             one of the cats
(about the weight of your ashes) interrupts, springing
on the keys of the open piano, depresses two high notes. Carrying you now,
it’s like I carry the part of yourself you can’t anymore. A heavy best bearing,
marriage, to under- and misunderstand. I slide you under the bed.
The girl, softly: “I don’t want to see it.” Fourteen now,
she said take out her confidential news I put in an earlier draft. I tell you this way!
And turn my laptop to position the painting as if on the church wall,
to see it the right way, as if without you, I must return to correctness.
                    3)
Imagining, next year, standing in Madrid, one of our favorite places:
El Prado, hall of the Tintoretto, long walk to the painting’s edge,
thence to center and the dispassionate dog. A chocolate or maybe lunchtime sherry taste
in my mouth, a portion of your ashes in my purse. Leaving a bit of you somewhere,
nowhere some jumpsuited worker could sweep you up, maybe nearby
in the Park of the Good Rest by the Big Pond where we drank coffee upon coffee
and read and wrote, watching children yell and play, plotted
bringing our future girl with us, or on the steps to mingle with the sandaled feet
of people you wanted to sketch, with their iPhones and belly-packs
stuffed with cash, cards, passports, tissues and tampons.
You liked those jumpsuits, bought one in a shop. Back home in your study,
typing in your cobalt bright jumpsuit, the throat unzipped
so gray chest hairs curled out at the placket, you were cross
when it was going well, apologized for your crossness, cross again.
Through the portico the sky roils lapis over San Marcuola—
he set the scene at home, not Jerusalem—see the canal with gondola
and gondolier. Crocks and bread and beards. We did take the baby to Venice.
Some Poles said: “Tsk! too young to travel.” A local: “Tsk, why no shoes, feet so cold,”
rubbing the baby’s feet to warm them. I got sick. The squid in the restaurant.
Padua was better. The Lamentation in the chapel. Sin biting her own face.
Bad Judas lifting face to kiss the Man in the Garden, bank of bystanders
waving a thicket of spikes, tableau of saint-heads served on golden dishes.
I had an infection, needed to pee, the body always making its demands,
you sketching the widows at Petrocchi where a bullet from an uprising
lodged in the wall. How cheerful they seemed! the widows, you noticed.
You liked them—and the currants in the market—
and always—I digress from digressing—you liked an uprising.
                    4)
                                            Your body in the room after you went—
your last an exhale. Basins, pillows, tubes. Holding your hand I turned my head
to be polite to the nurse who came in just then—me being pointlessly polite
made you impatient—that’s when you died. As if—I see, by this perspective,
myself self-absolve and self-condemn, over and over, no resolution
or correction—that was our whole life the last six months—
as if by turning, I turned the key to unlock you from yourself.
Then I waited for the social worker—tiny, plump, hard-charging—
good because I froze. I was supposed to have made plans for your body,
had left it though they told me not to, for you weren’t dead yet
when you were only dying. Waiting for her I was glad to have you
(I felt it was still you) there with me, giving me the comfort, as always,
of your company, bearing the weight of me, glad you were there
when she came hurrying in, the social worker, as if late—to what?
and got crematoriums on speaker, helplessly laughing with me helplessly laughing
at the donkey-braying drunk funeral director who said to come with you
to make sure the right body went to her ovens, and couldn’t for even two minutes
remember my name or yours, a skill that surely would come in handy
when selling the bereaved a burning. (You’d also have liked
when I told Siri-in-my-phone to remind me, that she noted down
Pick up asses at 3:30 in Upper Darby.) But when that was done,
after all it wasn’t you, and though I’d kissed you (dead)
an hour earlier, now I couldn’t kiss you.
                                                                 Turning my laptop, thinking of life
with you, can’t see it well, waking and walking and dream. Too close.
Not close. An accumulation of adjacent details. We were always standing
irresolute (me), resolute (you), in our lives’ center, actions garbling to episode.
Judas at the proper angle makes a story make sense. A proper angle
washes a thing. Like marriage at its best. A proper villain’s useful to going on.
Then my own dirt. A way to love. Shall I make a show of it.
Shall I wash my hands of it. Tell me—you’d know, you’d see it easy—
where the work goes. Where to stand to see it."
Owls,"—after Charles Baudelaire, “Les Hiboux”
In black yew shelters,
Owls tuck themselves away,
Strange gods
With red meditating shifty eyes,
Otherwise roost unstirring
Till the melancholy hour
When darkness shovels
The sun offstage.

Thus, they teach the sage
She need fear in this world
Only tumult and action.

Passing, drunk on shadows,
My punishment for desiring change
Is desiring more change."
Hands,"Of a thousand hands
I’d know my father’s,
long fingers shaped like oars,
the index scar,
the flat, grooved nails,
hands that fixed the doll’s arm,
mended Whisker’s ear, checked homework.
Those hands grated romano over Sunday pasta,
curled around glasses of wine
he toasted with at dinner,
or opened to offer the sweetest mulberries,
the ripest figs from his trees.

Once he kept a parsley caterpillar
so I could watch it emerge from its cocoon.
The jar was too small, though;
the wings dried with a crease.
It walked the long ramp of my father’s hand,
off balance at takeoff.
It fanned and fanned,
but the crease would not unfold,
the wings could not lift.
My father set it in the grass,
and we watched it walk
the short runway of its life,
a tiny lopsided glider without wind.
My father’s hands, like long anchors,
dangled at his sides."
Lost in the Snow,"We have circled the area for hours, unsure
where we are on the map, and when we are sure,
not sure how to get where we’re going to view
cathedrals and broken marbles in alcoves, and it’s
snowing, flakes laying a little carpet around us as we
search for a way out, a way back into a clearing while
one of us keeps looking at a map as we single-file
down narrow streets leaving a snow trail and see
a train station where we can board as soon as we
figure out where it will take us while the snow
falls and keeps falling and icing the tracks, engines
struggling and wheezing, a distant whistle, wind
swirling snow, and snow covering benches, and sky
is paper, a few birds scratching marks, one leaving
hieroglyphs on the ground beside us as we look
at the map and see nothing we know but know
that some time before long we’ll be somewhere
we want to go as the snow keeps falling and falling."
Transit,"(for Emily)
At the museum of old trains,
the ever-rusting graveyard bound
by a living stream and a heavy
humid drapery of weeds hung from pines,
you in slim black mourning dress and boots
pick your way among the rubble
of metal bones and tracks, then stop to pose
on the fourth step of a wooden stairs
disjoined from what it belonged to,
and turn your head this way and that,
spilling sunlit hair down one shoulder
then the other."
Bad Daughter,"It’s my own mother
I think of when
in the hot car it
hurts me to watch
my painstaking girl
return from the
water ice kiosk
balancing three lemon
ices in a four-hole
tray, plastic spoons
fanned in her fist, wad
of napkins wedged
between the ices,
when a gust makes
the napkins riffle then
gamboling lift off,
like and unlike
ones that went before,
fair girls in festival
dresses dancing
up the street, leaving
her at the curb
in flipflops and sweatshorts
looking through the car window
to see if I’m mad."
Kissinger at the Louvre (Three Drafts),"             1
Kissinger in black-tie shuffles to the town car
idling at the museum complex edge
between where the glum Pei pyramid rises
and the gardens begin. “Is that—” I say,
and “Yes,” says Jim, baby in his arms,
me shoving the empty stroller to get home
by naptime. Nobody notices, clicking
at each other through camera phones, Kissinger
looking matchlessly neat, clean, ugly and
dressed by servants. His driver’s at the door,
arms stretched wide as in a fish-this-big tall tale
in welcome. The ear-wired bodyguard,
hand on Kissinger’s gray-fur head so it won’t
scrape the door-frame, bends him into the car.
If I were a different kind of poet, I’d put
Kissinger in front of The Raft of the Medusa
blinking at the father weeping for his son
lying dead over his lap as the sails
of the ship that will rescue them are
sighted on the horizon and the top man
in the spout of survivors waves his ragged
undershirt. Or I’d put him gazing reflectively
at The Death of Sardanapalus, a Potentate
presiding amid an exorbitance of fabrics
over his imminent suicide by fire,
slaves bringing in, in order of importance,
horses, gems, plate and favored concubines
for slaughter. I’m not that kind of poet.
             2
Kissinger totters befuddled by culpability,
luncheon champagne and dotage. The car
eats him. I won’t pretend the bodyguard’s
Vietnamese or Cambodian, though that’s
the obvious truth-in-lies move—he’s French,
that ratface-handsome, smoked-out look—
and doesn’t care merde for history. He makes
the old man bow, same move with which
the beat cop, our public servant, submits
the petty criminal to the patrol car,
same move the anguished teenager got—
half-protective, half-corrective or coercive,
half-kind—after the arraignment for leaving
her newborn to die in a rest stop dumpster.
Anybody can understand the girl, and even
the purse-snatcher. Bodyguard bends Kissinger
gently in, portly little Kissinger, gloves his head—
anything hurt will be the hand of the servant.
Ecru upholstery with oxblood accents, minibar
something like a safe, CNN muted to newscrawl
and the anchor’s frozen-flesh face. The latest assistant,
gender irrelevant, busy with a BlackBerry across from him,
root beer-colored eyes and preternaturally neat hair
of La belle ferronière, keeps the lap desk, emergency
Magic Wand Stain Remover Stick, eyebrow brush
and dossier of Opinions in what looks like
“the football”—the nuclear war plan suitcase
Presidential aides carry at all times—but isn’t.
             3
The one camera flash as he got in
gave Kissinger a headache. As they start
for his Avenue du President Wilson hotel,
the Rue de Rivoli sliding by in a haze,
he falls uncomfortably asleep to the anodyne
glow and murmur (“tournez à gauche”) of the driver’s
GPS device. The relieved assistant
opens an Imagist anthology. In Osaka, Oslo or Wasilla,
Alaska some weeks later, a woman at her kitchen table
uploads Paris vacation photos to her laptop.
“Who’s that behind me?” A dark figure. “He looks familiar.”
“How should I know,” says her husband.
“I’m trying to get Baby to eat more potato.”
“Oh well. I look fat in it,” she says. And deletes."
Banding,"The nets of God hang in every wild place
to catch the unwary migrant, one with the skull
still soft, the journey barely started,
another to fall from the sky on the ten thousandth mile,

but when he holds one of those small, terrified
bodies like a jewel between his thumb and forefinger
and unfans the wing to measure it, secretly admiring
the bars he conceived to catch his own hungry eye,
and the little claw foot he rings with a coded band
that numbers the feathers and weds him forever
to the pulse in his palm that recalls his own heaving heart
the day he flew into a net and hung there thirsting
in the woods where only a wasp moved, flicking cobalt wings—

when he lets go, when he flings what he has marked
into emptiness, he follows the speck with his eye
to South America and farther, to white unmapped fields
known intimately in the mind of one who flies."
My Brother is Getting Arrested Again,"My brother is getting arrested again.
What does he want? What does he know?
We can’t talk politics. He doesn’t have politics.
I’m helpless with him.

My brother is getting arrested again.
He is not weeding community gardens.
He is not climbing on roofs to bang
with hammer on shingles, admire
his arm-hairs going gold in the sun.

My brother is getting arrested again.

My mother makes sarcastic remarks
and bails him out.
They can’t talk politics.
She’s helpless with him.

He pushes hard at a sawhorse barricade,
black bandana up over his nose.
He shouts this is what democracy looks like.

My brother is getting arrested again.

He’s not lending a hand at needle exchanges.
Not fishing from pier’s end with his best buddy, Dad.
He might be facing the incoming clouds.

He’s not wearing pinstripes, seersucker, wingtips,
not dressing down for casual Friday. He doesn’t care
about the future of Krispy Kreme stock.

My father clears his throat. He says “being pro-Palestinian
is anti-Semitic.” They can’t talk politics.
My father is helpless with him.
The barricade breaks,
the yellow do-not-cross crossbeam
smacks to the ground.
My little sister says, snippily, “I agree with him—
in principle.” They don’t talk politics.
She’s helpless with him.

My brother is getting arrested again.

A sudden melee, my brother disappearing.
He sucks in others like a star imploding.

He’s down, he’s lifted away,
wrists latched behind his back.

Now he stinks from the heat on the prison bus.
Now he’s stuffed in a holding cell with eight other protesters.
Now they take apart the sandwiches they get in jail.
They eat the bread—they toss
the orange limp cheese square at the wall.
It sticks. Collaborative chem-processed
chance-operation artwork. It’s a whale!
It’s the mayor! It’s the moon!
No sleep for three days and three nights,
the lights never go out, the delirious
buzzed noise of themselves. They can’t
take a shower. They sass the guards,
chant protest chants. This is what democracy
smells like. The funniest joke they ever told.

My brother signs his name on a paper, gets out.

And now?

Is he hopping dancelessly obedient
to directional arrows on a suburban mall machine
called Dance Dance Revolution?

Is he driving a waverunner in circles and laughing
on the filthy Delaware, our city’s river?
Is he advanced degreeing in the even-weathered West?
Is he climbing Mt. Rainier?

Nope. Come rain, or shine, or sweat, or hope,
my brother is getting arrested again."
She Didn’t Mean to Do It,"Oh, she was sad, oh, she was sad.
She didn’t mean to do it.
Certain thrills stay tucked in your limbs,
go no further than your fingers, move your legs through their paces,
but no more. Certain thrills knock you flat
on your sheets on your bed in your room and you fade
and they fade. You falter and they’re gone, gone, gone.
Certain thrills puff off you like smoke rings,
some like bell rings growing out, out, turning
brass, steel, gold, till the whole world’s filled
with the gonging of your thrills.
But oh, she was sad, she was just sad, sad,
and she didn’t mean to do it."

tamper with natural beauty in search of convention,

Ode to People Who Hate Me,"I hate being hated even though I 
provoke it, not by committing major wrongs 
like murder, more like a regular 
pattern of being selfish or forgetful, 
which is another word for selfish. 
If you hate me, trust me I know—
in fact, I have a ledger of people, like you, 
who hate me, and I rifle through it every 
morning obsessing over the names more 
than they think about mine—a passing 
thought, a microsecond of dislike or worse, 
indifference like the Godzilla rays of fire 
I feel buzz out of your eyes when 
you scroll past my pictures on Instagram. 
I should focus on the people who love me,
every therapist I ever had has told me so, 
but I don’t need them to love me more, 
so that’s pointless. If we hate each other, 
I assure you my hate has a trace of love 
with a dash of hope. It’s the throbbing 
contradiction of hate’s dark thrall. "
Inner,"“Our psyches resemble the bordertowns [. . .]. Nothing happens in the ‘real’ world unless it first happens in the images in our heads.”
            —Gloria Anzaldúa, “Towards a New Consciousness,” Borderlands/La Frontera
You wrote of communal ground, prepare  
beyond culture to unite us. All to hold us, in 
bind, Gloria. Awareness of situation before inner  
change. Inner change before societal change. I do  
not mistake this for an equation. To develop  
unencumbered, we must understand our own 
split: from history, from language, from each of our faces— 
the situation: intentionality behind the dominant
white culture’s thoughts & actions to cull us. Realness  
of our fabrication of real. Pock holes in the real to remake
the real. If we ask the llama to explain their relationship  
to the heard. Silence. Someone thinks sumpter animal. 
Someone thinks beast of burden. In the high alpines 
of the Andes, the cousin vicuña moves at night among 
steep slopes & festuca, continues to resist domestication. 
Ask the vicuña, Who do you serve? Silence. Someone 
mistakes the lack of sound for acquiescence. Someone  
labels a wild thing sacred. Someone labels a wild thing 
dangerous. Someone doesn’t like the use of animal 
or thing associated with their personhood. Someone
wants more animality, less human. Collapse the word 
human into its embodied history of colonized with-
holding meant to deteriorate a body not white. I label 
myself animal. Reach knuckles & wrists inside my throat 
to pull & gather all the gutturals within my tissues. I wonder who 
labels me dangerous now. A word is a bordertown. Belief in 
vocabulary means we carve ourselves out of plurality. Town  
before the town. & the outer terrains sculpt from the inner  
terrains & a mouth held shut still resides in a cerebrum firing— 
thinking & voluntary muscles controlled by the same organ. "

The Palace-Burner,"A picture in a newspaper
She has been burning palaces. “To see
     The sparks look pretty in the wind?” Well, yes—
And something more. But women brave as she
     Leave much for cowards, such as I, to guess.
But this is old, so old that everything
     Is ashes here—the woman and the rest.
Two years are—oh! so long. Now you may bring
     Some newer pictures. You like this one best?
You wish that you had lived in Paris then?
     You would have loved to burn a palace, too?
But they had guns in France, and Christian men
     Shot wicked little Communists like you.
You would have burned the palace?—Just because
     You did not live in it yourself! Oh! why
Have I not taught you to respect the laws?
     You would have burned the palace—would not I?
Would I? Go to your play. Would I, indeed?
     I? Does the boy not know my soul to be
Languid and worldly, with a dainty need
     For light and music? Yet he questions me.
Can he have seen my soul more near than I?
     Ah! in the dusk and distance sweet she seems,
With lips to kiss away a baby’s cry,
     Hands fit for flowers, and eyes for tears and dreams.
Can he have seen my soul? And could she wear
     Such utter life upon a dying face:
Such unappealing, beautiful despair:
     Such garments— soon to be a shroud—with grace?
Has she a charm so calm that it could breathe
     In damp, low places till some frightened hour;
Then start, like a fair, subtle snake, and wreathe
     A stinging poison with shadowy power?
Would I burn palaces? The child has seen
     In this fierce creature of the Commune here,
So bright with bitterness and so serene,
     A being finer than my soul, I fear."
Long Week Talking,"I am ashamed to keep thinking of death
as a chute that connects to the garbage. I know
I should picture it more like the pneumatic tubes
at banks of the past: you put in your name
and your paper and up you go. I know a bank
should be the operative metaphor
for every facet of existence, every time. I’m sorry
I haven’t more regularly made reference
to a bank. When I fail to liken something to a bank,
that’s how I can tell I’m tired. That’s not me,
I assure everybody. That’s the long week talking. Time
for bed. Time for the window, the hectoring sky,
the streetlight bright as the bright saved people
see before they die, but I don’t die."
Breath for Metal,"This a story
I’ve kept in soft
orange inside
my steel body. I’ve wanted
to wait until I’ve
cooled to hum, until
my touch wouldn’t burn.

             not to be odd.   To remember
me a calm line transmitting        not artificial
sugar smile melts a rainy spring I do not want
to feel a tug       you wait again for what’s

Home,"It takes a heap o’ livin’ in a house t’ make it home,
A heap o’ sun an’ shadder, an’ ye sometimes have t’ roam
Afore ye really ’preciate the things ye lef’ behind,
An’ hunger fer ’em somehow, with ’em allus on yer mind.
It don’t make any differunce how rich ye get t’ be,
How much yer chairs an’ tables cost, how great yer luxury;
It ain’t home t’ ye, though it be the palace of a king,
Until somehow yer soul is sort o’ wrapped round everything.
Home ain’t a place that gold can buy or get up in a minute;
Afore it’s home there’s got t’ be a heap o’ livin’ in it;
Within the walls there’s got t’ be some babies born, and then
Right there ye’ve got t’ bring ‘em up t’ women good, an’ men;
And gradjerly, as time goes on, ye find ye wouldn’t part
With anything they ever used—they’ve grown into yer heart:
The old high chairs, the playthings, too, the little shoes they wore
Ye hoard; an’ if ye could ye’d keep the thumbmarks on the door.
Ye’ve got t’ weep t’ make it home, ye’ve got t’ sit an’ sigh
An’ watch beside a loved one’s bed, an’ know that Death is nigh;
An’ in the stillness o’ the night t’ see Death’s angel come,
An’ close the eyes o’ her that smiled, an’ leave her sweet voice dumb.
Fer these are scenes that grip the heart, an’ when yer tears are dried,
Ye find the home is dearer than it was, an’ sanctified;
An’ tuggin’ at ye always are the pleasant memories
O’ her that was an’ is no more—ye can’t escape from these.
Ye’ve got t’ sing an’ dance fer years, ye’ve got t’ romp an’ play,
An’ learn t’ love the things ye have by usin’ ’em each day;
Even the roses ’round the porch must blossom year by year
Afore they ’come a part o’ ye, suggestin’ someone dear
Who used t’ love ’em long ago, an’ trained ’em jes’ t’ run
The way they do, so’s they would get the early mornin’ sun;
Ye’ve got t’ love each brick an’ stone from cellar up t’ dome:
It takes a heap o’ livin’ in a house t’ make it home."
Places,"I dreamed you.
I waited 45 years for you
to find me.
I have nothing to give you
But these places
I have been.
I own no home.
I carry my life with me 
In boxes
on my back.
Sometimes when you look 
at me
I want to show you
Everything.
How the stars turn in the 
night sky over Santa Fe.
How snow falls like filigree
through a blue moon.
How a slice 
of sweet Hawaiian 
Mountain apple
between your lips
calls forth the 
forest 
it was plucked from.
I want to take you places
You have never been.
With anyone.
I want to tell you everything.
How once when I was 26
I drove around and around
searching for other Lesbians.
I want to show you every scar.
I want to tell you about 
Anita and Parker.
How death came for them
In the name of cancer 
claiming parts of me
you can never have.
I want to whisper
Everything.
As you stall into my 
shoulder

Lateral Violence,"For Valorie
First a flabby belittlement by some well-meaning
white folks when they cross me because they weren’t meaning
to, they say. It was only that I had become wholly invisible 
and they enjoy their heaping, entitled vocalizations
that enforce their platforms of corporeal speech. 
But through this I learned that I had no real power to wield, 
and this crown I wore, glittering in green fermentation,
put my head into a state of chronic query. 
My desire is lost in a fomenting chrome. 
But then I noticed my solidarity sisters sniff out my lack, too, 
and the vascular trauma of hurt in my blood became 
a wound in my particles. 
Distinctions around difference and assimilation fester
and hurt feelings erupt from lateral power. 
It pains much worse because they seem to be playing
out a supremacy of whiteness, of wielding power
from which an outspread lack peels away to a nothingness 
marked with the pinkest cardinal feelings. 
I don’t believe we outright demean each other,
we might just be trying to fit ourselves in, 
hating all the spirals inside of the shape
trying to let them fizz or spark, but a wrongness
emerges replacing the earned principled feeling. 
I say all this because I look back on how power systems
at play in microaggressions still impart feelings 
of terror because they annihilate, desecrating
the inner self-protection one might seed or learned behind 
some favored sanguine curtains.
I recall myself there hiding a judgment going back colonial centuries: 
how it sticks in fenced edges. How I knew trying to make friends
would undo my best intentions and thwart so much 
of what had been a fernery of deep and culminating sympathies. 
My heart, my mind, my head hoped we’d have real intimacy—
bonded connections based on our chunky hardships,  
not the hard bitten loss in the over-harvested field of 
scarcity knocking several of us down with full force.  
And now do we sit in this field, doing the scholarly work
of facing the empire, but wounded from those 
whom we bitterly wanted on our side, not on our back."

I drank sour beer on pine 
slats built smartly to
jut from the house
throwing anchor long past 
the edge of anything calendrical.
I laid the stems of letters 
across wet pages. Does it
sit right at the hip? Is it
in key? Is it
mimetic? Is it 
lacy or sparking?
Is it speaking?
I might have packed it all
up, a beginning, an edge, a
rim, a rime, a shine.
It shone in her mind. Music
is just a job."
Black Earth,"Openly, yes,
with the naturalness
                 of the hippopotamus or the alligator
                 when it climbs out on the bank to experience the
sun, I do these
things which I do, which please
                 no one but myself. Now I breathe and now I am sub-
                 merged; the blemishes stand up and shout when the object
in view was a
renaissance; shall I say
                 the contrary? The sediment of the river which
                 encrusts my joints, makes me very gray but I am used
to it, it may
remain there; do away
                 with it and I am myself done away with, for the
                 patina of circumstance can but enrich what was
there to begin
with. This elephant skin
                 which I inhabit, fibered over like the shell of
                 the coco-nut, this piece of black glass through which no light
can filter—cut
into checkers by rut
                 upon rut of unpreventable experience—
                 it is a manual for the peanut-tongued and the
hairy toed. Black
but beautiful, my back
                 is full of the history of power. Of power? What
                 is powerful and what is not? My soul shall never
be cut into
by a wooden spear; through-
                 out childhood to the present time, the unity of
                 life and death has been expressed by the circumference
described by my
trunk; nevertheless, I
                 perceive feats of strength to be inexplicable after
                 all; and I am on my guard; external poise, it
has its centre
well nurtured—we know
                 where—in pride, but spiritual poise, it has its centre where?
                 My ears are sensitized to more than the sound of
the wind. I see
and I hear, unlike the
                 wandlike body of which one hears so much, which was made
                 to see and not to see; to hear and not to hear,
that tree trunk without   
roots, accustomed to shout
                 its own thoughts to itself like a shell, maintained intact   
                 by who knows what strange pressure of the atmosphere; that   
spiritual   
brother to the coral
                 plant, absorbed into which, the equable sapphire light
                 becomes a nebulous green. The I of each is to
the I of each,
a kind of fretful speech
                 which sets a limit on itself; the elephant is?
                 Black earth preceded by a tendril? It is to that
phenomenon
the above formation,   
                 translucent like the atmosphere—a cortex merely—
                 that on which darts cannot strike decisively the first
time, a substance
needful as an instance
                 of the indestructibility of matter; it   
                 has looked at the electricity and at the earth-
quake and is still
here; the name means thick. Will
                 depth be depth, thick skin be thick, to one who can see no
                 beautiful element of unreason under it?"
Swim,"          for Rosalba 
Underwater, my lungs burn at the thought of breaking the surface. 
I am reminded of when I learned to hold my breath. During your first trimester, 
you would breathe in double the amount of oxygen and pump 
ninety percent of it to me. My lungs learning to hold air 
without the possibility of drowning. I break the surface, 
force myself to stay afloat. The weight of my body 
distributed across the water. I think back to lessons 
regarding buoyancy. How I learned to float on my back 
during your second trimester, when our heartbeat was one 
shared song. My body turns in the fetal position. I hold my breath 
              and push off the walls of your stomach– 
my legs kicking and squirming. I think back to when I learned 
how to swim. When your body signaled to me that it was time to leave 
at the end of your third trimester. I could no longer use your umbilical cord 
like a floatie. Into the world I swam. Into a world that warns 
you of the dangers of water without teaching you how to swim. 
I think about how you spend your one day off from work 
at Yosemite Pool. Where you taught yourself how to kick and 
pull and push the water around you to stay alive. Then,

threw me in the water and taught me the same.

 "
Old Age,"In me is a little painted square
Bordered by old shops, with gaudy awnings.
And before the shops sit smoking, open-bloused old men,
Drinking sunlight.
The old men are my thoughts:
And I come to them each evening, in a creaking cart,
And quietly unload supplies.
We fill slim pipes and chat,
And inhale scents from pale flowers in the center of the square . . .
Strong men, tinkling women, and dripping, squealing children
Stroll past us, or into the shops.
They greet the shopkeepers, and touch their hats or foreheads to me . . .
Some evening I shall not return to my people."
Short Talk on Pain,"Lawns  and  fields  and  hills  and  wide  old   velvet
sleeves, green things.  They stretch, fold, roll away,
unfurl  and  calm the  eye.  Look  lush  in paintings.
Battles are fought on greens.  Or  you could spread
a meal  and  sup.  How  secretly  they  lie,  floors  of
distant forests.  Next  comes  the grave,  in  many a
poem about green. But this is not a poem. This is a
billboard for frozen green peas.  Frozen green peas
are good for pain."
Likely,"Most days come 
along like a child
kicking a stone
down an alley
or like the way
the mail lies
in the mailbox,
its flag up. But
sometimes as
you wander into
some old worlds,
you feel yourself
gliding on the morning,
maybe looking back
over your shoulder."
Exposition,"Each new  arrival  walks  into  an incomplete  fiction.
The meaning  of the work  is fragmentary.  The story
has  begun  with  a  driving  question:  “What   is  the
function of  diagnosis?”  or  “What can  be made out
of loneliness?” Lauren  is very  elaborate  and writes,
“What is the meaning  of an accumulation of  coffee
pots?”  When   asked  to   identify  a  yoke,  she  says,
“Thing   you   put   around   an   ox—noose.”  Lauren
withdraws,  stops  doing her  homework,  and  hangs
shards of  scenery:  jigsaw  puzzles,  broken  cameras,
decrees.  All   the  characters  are  happenstance  and
helium.  All the dialogue is conditional. When asked
to      identify    a     tourniquet,     she     answers,    “a
blood-pressure   thingie,”    testifying  to  a  life   now
reduced on the Suicide Potential Scale.  Lauren also
endorses the  phrase,  “I wish I could  be as  happy as
others seem to be.” She sits inside a viewfinder while
the  horizon  scans her  brain for  fires.  The sky  sags
into  a  blue  body  cast.  What  is  the  meaning of  a
mountain of masks?"
From “Information Desk: An Epic” [Sometimes on my break],"    Sometimes on my break
I’d take my name tag off so no one’d know to
    ask anything of me—such as on the longest days 
of winter break in a slowly chilling
    voice reserved for
when she’d had enough my mother’d
    say, “I’m not your mother”—
and I’d sprawl as she did in our living room
    across the only sofa
in the Museum not
    cordoned off with red arousing rope like
enormous nipple tassels of
    grief and lust and read Balzac’s Lily of the Valley
under the moony
    portrait of Princesse de Broglie,
an aged descendant of whom, staunch
    with flirtatious guilt, asked
me at the Information Desk soon
    after opening on a day
that wing was closed
    for special permission to see that ancestor
she’d been told she so resembled
    but whom she said she’d only
ever seen in books
    framed above a defunct
mantel regal in a long, cold gown
    the infinite blue
of sorrow and wealth. She is so noble as to have
    four necks: start with the most conspicuous
around which gold shows
    her jugular how to throb,
then take that staircase one flight down
    to the throat of her wrist encircled 
in a helix of a necklace of so many
    pearls a mere bracelet is of
insufficient breadth to bed the many
    oysters from whose recurring
nightmares out they rolled, down with which we go
    one further lucent turning to ground-level
viewing of the naked
    body who stood
for the Princesse that the artist could,
    with the trademark accuracy of ice,
drape over a true female anatomy
    that killer silk
to gaze into is to want to
    drown yourself. That’s three—! then
rush all the way back up the staircase to recall 
    in the tremble of her feather hair clip
the retracted neck of the sub-Saharan
    marabou stork in flight—
the “undertaker bird,”
    so called from
behind its back for how much those cloakish wings
    —the largest span of any land bird—
look like a hunched Victorian death-dealing
    a cadaver. Which it is!
Tuberculosis!
    Oh Princesse! Why
don’t I feel more for you?
    Your early death, your blue dress everyone
wants to taste, and the restrained sadness
    that droops your eyelids
as if you’re a little high or hiding
    something big and willing yourself
not to scream. I want to love you, too,
    but I’m too jealous
of how your opera gloves,
    nonchalantly filled with
having just been to the opera, are slung
    over the arm of the chair you’re leaning
on to reveal how your elongated
    ungloved fingers taper
into tips so attenuated
    you could pick a different
lock with each
    and simultaneously enter ten different
exclusive realms of being,
    unlimited by time, gravity,
birth, or money."
While the Dog Sleeps,"It’s the birthday of Stephen Crane.
On this date, Michelangelo said yes
to the pope and gathered his brushes.
At the church next door, the choir
is rehearsing. There is nothing
I want to rehearse. Recently I’ve
been realizing, “If that didn’t exist, I 
would never miss it.” I say it a lot.
But not about you. We put isinglass
over the screens on the porch so we
could sit there in sweaters, take the time
to see what was in front of us. Now
“tomorrow” is a strange word, “now”
even stranger. “Yesterday” makes sense,
but not much of it is true. Our dog still
keeps sleep. I imagine him dreaming
la dolce far niente. When asked
if I miss what I did for forty years
I like to say, “That never existed.”
Now here on the porch I take in the light
crossing the last leaves doing their slow
dance in the breeze, watch the chickadees
at the feeder, once in a while glance at
the sundial we set in the shade of the redbud. "

October 26, 2020, 2 p.m.;

marking the beginning of

about the fact that the Now I keep

    in the course of this
poem while time courses through me,
    as when
a teenager swimming with friends in an
    unsupervised backyard pool we didn’t
skinny-dip nearly enough in but
    into which I plunged once alone through
an aqueous, unforgiving kingdom of light
    that penetrated to
the lowest depths
    I held my breath to madness to behold,
coming up for air I
    knew I would never belong to my
friends again, there on the pool deck, beautiful, tan, laughing
    about something someone said, and then
someone arrives with a cooler of his
    father’s beer, and
someone else hands me a towel,
    as if
I am a body;
    smalt,
called “cobalt” when taking the temporary form
    of a bottle on a shelf,
a blue ground glass phase-transitioned from liquid
    after being plunged into ice; ochers and
umbers of the earth
    in cave paintings depicting
among a herd of wild goats, a goat
    on two feet, taut below the pelt of which, a bow I
cannot see, but a microscope reveals
    fretwork in
the baroque exoskeletons of
    phytoplankton
that at one millimeter per century

most forsaken—unbearable gash-bright

bent-neck lab vessel resembling
    the head of a waterbird

    and cinnabar in its quickliquid
mercurial form
    heat together to a vapor
that crystallizes and gets scraped out
    as in a D&C a deep slaughterhouse red
blazing the huntsmen’s coats,
    robes of Saint Jerome,
and the vivid, burning gowns
    of how many tragic, triumphant
inexperienced married widow
    experienced virgin untitled English
French Dutch titled American women, turned out
    at home, in private parks, public halls,
dancing and strolling,
    reclining and standing,
throughout the Museum
    in a time-darkened darkening shade
of volcanic activity
    in oblivious vermilion reluctant acknowledgment
of the Spanish convicts and
    enslaved North Africans
who died extracting it
    from the same mine whence comes
imperceptible trace bleeding
    from an incision in the neck
of a Bronze Age Cycladic figure

trained like a knife at the jugular

Three of Cups,"for Brian D.
That night the vindaloo ruined my mouth
for anything but drink. Not the puckerings
of your gasoline, martinis, you called them,
slow and steel . . . I only had those once,
a December night you prepared to press
your luck. Who else would wait to order
on Christmas Eve just to see if it would 
all arrive? A tsunami of rounds, a carnival 
ride in the rain. It was V’s birthday,
so that started us off, bars accumulating
like compound interest: Botanica, blurred
light, Mexican Radio, wet salt, and me
getting broke like a plate. Remember our
first dinner with the soup thick as my waist
and the turkey splintered sweet off the neck?
Before Lori, the bold bartender from 1st &
A, wraps her boyfriend tight with her knees,
he shows us pilot-style how JFK Jr. went down,
how he had to be recovered . . . Must I squeeze 
a drop of blood into this the size of a pimento? 
Or is it enough to bring up this grave spiral of 
hands, my pockets turned out to tiny ghosts, 
and Lori paying twenty bucks in Three of Cups 
            for Volare oh oh oh oh . . . 
                        Cantare oh wo wo wo wo . . .
Beyond the magic circle of cigarette butts,
the man in the tux lives singing in our dreams . . .
Where are you now? What fuel burns your throat?
Who is holding your empty hand?"
Letter to al-Mutanabbi,"You were right
Your words are still wings of light
always carrying you to us
sometimes carrying us to you
Your name is a green tattoo
on Baghdad’s tired face
Your street the forehead
of a body beheaded every morning
Just another chapter
in the saga of blood and ink
you knew so well
I cannot lie to you
I’m quite pessimistic
we are still etching
the walls of this cave
thousands of years long
with signs we keep reinterpreting
and myths about a future world
where we don’t devour one another
where the sun is friendly
and the seas cannot inherit our fever
Some are digging
a deeper grave
about to embrace us all
they, too, have their engravings,
maps, philosophers, and books
We can only keep dreaming
of a shore for the wind
and dig wells
in the dark
with fingernails of silence and solitude
we will weave an ocean out of ink
for our myths
and out of words a sail
or a shroud
vast enough for all.
Every book is a well
around which we sit
drinking to your health
trying to live
as you did
with death and after it
Al-Mutanabbi (10th century) was one of the greatest classical Arab poets. Al-Mutanabbi Street, in the heart of old Baghdad, is the cultural center of the city with tens of bookshops and stalls and the famous Shahbandar café where the literati congregated every Friday. On March 5th 2007, a bomb exploded, killing twenty-six civilians and destroying many of the bookshops."
Dismemberment,"The body, or a voice impersonating it, said:
Go! As of now, you are all free.
The eyes flew far away, joining flocks of other eyes.
which had filled the sky, almost blocking the sunlight.
The lips parted company without a farewell;
One searched for a new face,
the other for a lip that would listen to its complaints.
The tired tongue sought a mute man's mouth to rest in.
The hands clapped and waved to each other as they fled
away.
The right leg appeared frightened and hesitant,
then rushed to catch up with the left leg.
The nose fell on the ground. . .
As for the heart, it kept beating alone
until a stray foot crushed it."

Syrinx Spring,"A fragment broken off a canary mystery play

The Humming-Bird,"The sundial makes no sign
At the point of the August noon.
The sky is of ancient tin,
And the ring of the mountains diffused and unmade
(One always remembers them).
On the twisted dark of the hemlock hedge
Rain, like a line of shivering violin-bows
Hissing together, poised on the last turgescent swell,
Batters the flowers.
Under the trumpet-vine arbor,
Clear, precise as an Audubon print,
           The air is of melted glass,
           Solid, filling interstices
Of leaves that are spaced on the spines
           Like a pattern ground into glass;
           Dead, as though dull red glass were poured into the mouth,
Choking the breath, molding itself into the creases of soft red tissues.
And a humming-bird darts head first,
Splitting the air, keen as a spurt of fire shot from the blow-pipe,
Cracking a star of rays; dives like a flash of fire,
Forked tail lancing the air, into the immobile trumpet;
Stands on the air, wings like a triple shadow
Whizzing around him.
Shadows thrown on the midnight streets by a snow-flecked arc-light,
Shadows like sword-play,
Splinters and spines from a thousand dreams
Whizz from his wings!"
Theodore the Poet,"As a boy, Theodore, you sat for long hours
On the shore of the turbid Spoon
With deep-set eye staring at the door of the crawfish’s burrow,
Waiting for him to appear, pushing ahead,
First his waving antennae, like straws of hay,
And soon his body, colored like soap-stone,
Gemmed with eyes of jet.
And you wondered in a trance of thought
What he knew, what he desired, and why he lived at all.
But later your vision watched for men and women
Hiding in burrows of fate amid great cities,
Looking for the souls of them to come out,
So that you could see
How they lived, and for what,
And why they kept crawling so busily
Along the sandy way where water fails
As the summer wanes."
Minotaur,"after Carl Phillips
The best part,
how we make to
part the beast
from its self. 
Take the bull  
(whose head it’s got. 
Now, conjure you—
the offal, bovine throat,
a veiny tract meant
for an alfalfa pasture,
clover, sundry grasses
soon to cud; or 
a garden got at: trampled 
angel’s breath, marigold, 
            daisy, rose, chomped down,
            also, though, grown, only,
            it seems, to prune to mean 
            a human being 
what humans are—
and there: a tendril 
coils from your skull,
then petals split 
the temple, come 
to bloom. See, how 
now the bull face, 
stricken, blinks), 
finding a way, 
reeling, through new 
bewildering appetites."
Sunday Morning,"The weather turned bad and I got happy.
That’s wrong—I mean the morning sky
was ash blue, birds on the ground. I mean
not happy but good, not good
but fastened, steady, like every train in the city
was running late, but no one minded.
On 12th Street, tarpaulin swelled
and bowed in wind. Rain drove straight
through a woman’s dress. And again
on Hollis, that slowness: damp black
trees, the line of streetlights
paced like breath. I pulled over. Leaves
dripped like rinsed hands.
A girl held her mother 
by the shoulders on a porch. "
"Syracuse, October","Fuck the hot autumns of Charleston, fuck handsome
Alabama, fuck the Deep South alcoholics
standing in flannel in the summer sun. I drove north.
I took Green Road to Hubbardsville
and saw October in August, booted men hosing grit
off the park pool’s bottom, crisp leaves lifted
like the remnants of summer’s collective memory.
I drove out or into it listening to the Liverpool Choir’s
mournful version of the national anthem, the tuning forks
of eastern townships bringing a Stravinsky more film score
then symphony. I wanted the blaze of the unmuffled
trumpet, the spin song of the laundromat, a little of the hurricane’s
Guernican remedy in the streeted leaves, in the blooms
of glass from kids breaking fluorescent
light tubes in the spent vocabulary
of an asphalt parking lot. I wanted
October: lace trim of a black dress slumped
on the floor of my birthday, cold skin
and laughter. Little burn on the leaves, little love
declaration; little dull light in the white sky."
Explaining the Resurrection in Simple Words,"A blessing can be the act
of invoking divine
protection,
or a favor or gift
bestowed by god,
and I don’t know
how to define mercy,
but the field
is lit like the heart
of the night, gnats flitting
above the crosshatched grass,
huge shadows of the ballplayers in stadium light
whistling in signals
from the outfield.
The wind lifts and settles
our shirts against our skin,
and you ask after my day:
there’d been pinwheels
spinning on a rain-soaked lawn, pigeons
cooing and nesting in the gutters.
I’d pressed my back to the dark
damp wood of the trunk.
Yellow flowers fell on me."
The Tell-Tale Heart,"Confinement is part of confinement.
As it is part of worms
to go through the surface
(like death and roots),
confinement starts
at the very moment of impairment.
They say that a few inches underground
it is possible to hear all
the rumors of the world.
That they are just heartbeats, almost imperceptible
that become from one moment to the next
like a desperate pounding.
They say humidity 
is part of the charm,
and that it sometimes suffocates,
like the measured sadness
that comes from the impossibility
of seeing one’s own face
in the mirror."
Garden Variety with Lesbians,"You rake the soil of our verge, preparing our plot for summer.
Between us, walking—neighbors and dogs, questions: what are we doing here, to the earth
of our verge—unhinged rhizomes heap, clumped grief of an old barrow sways drunk on its wheel.
We agree: the barren of potential; we agree, bulbs—their dormancy, a poem—
and tubers—like language, for their incubation of eyes. I emerge, eyes
on you, nuclear to the sun—beside you, lowering; beside you, that glow-eyed beast
of emptiness arranging.
*
I tell you about this morning’s dream. You tear the ground with a pickaxe; I manicure
weeds from the loamy apron of a young tree. I admit: I stared at our newborn with regret.
True, you laugh light into our longing. A mother tells me: Early morning dreams are premonitions.
What premonition is it to long to see (the Earth); what regret is it to birth another into this longing?
Impossible resources.
But how early was it—the morning—the bouquet making-root in a sorry vase.
I am not one for intentional form, but maybe, babe—should we freeze our eggs?
*
You strongarm the wheelbarrow. Not me. Exoskeletal flora deflated like a dead birthday party.
Our cat pounces crickets from the limit of her tangled leash.
We leash because patriarchy. We leash because to verge leans always toward. Too toward.
Watch children! The slow or empty road. The crows’ luxury of carrion.
Today, I am wearing your pants and you are wearing mine—Sapphic! I crouch
to the earth of our verge—any keen beast knows what, there, next opens: Our raked plot effluvial.
But we know soil is all foreshadow. Fingers subtext glove-fingers, floral print—
syntax is the bacteria of desire.
Our hose froze broken—leaks, screeching—so we bear the water in cans.
*
We bare the water in cans and unload bagged soil from the bed. Our verge leans luxury. We’ll feast
on the effulgence of dinnerplate dahlias. But it’s early spring and I’m already
anxious about regretting labor.
We could fail the future, babe—do you, too, feel our potential
is a meaning leaning too much, too toward, swaying with unhinged grief—Why
do we labor the rearrangement of this plot?
Twist earthful effluvium. Difficult to tell your pants from mine.
We stare back the setting sun: love, a premonition of night foreshadowed
in light’s velvet ash.
Deliver me bulbs from the peatmoss of our winter-keep; I’ll strongarm
their tunicate survival—divulge!—as if it were nutrient reek of our own flesh, own whet nerve."
Pathetic Fallacy,"When it became impossible to speak to you
due to your having died and been incinerated,
I sometimes held the uncradled phone
with its neat digits and arcane symbols (crosshatch,
black star) as if embedded in it
were some code I could punch in
to reach you. You bequeathed me
this morbid bent, Mother.
Who gives her sixth-grade daughter
Sartre’s Nausea to read? All my life,
I watched you face the void,
leaning into it as a child with a black balloon
will bury her countenance
either to hide from
or to merge with that darkness.
Small wonder that still
in the invisible scrim of air
that delineates our separate worlds,
your features sometimes press toward me
all silvery from the afterlife, woven in wind,
to whisper a caution. Or your hand on my back
shoves me into my life."
III. Leviticus: In Dreams Begin Responsibilities,"No one had to announce it was deadly
more than a moccasin bite.
The dumbest guy here (picked from stiff competition)
knew he’d be extinguished soon, polluted.
The oil barons too smart to live here would
as soon snuff us out as look at us—
our spongy tumors, the scarlet growth
on the bird dog’s belly, the fistula
in the breast, the bowels, the hanging balls,
basal cell carcinoma burned off with a cigarette.
Three gas stations in this town now chemo centers so
you needn’t drive to Houston
to sit with pollution needled into your arm,
while far-off bosses who knew all along
hit pocked balls off small hickory tees
towards named greens that go forever on."

Ode to Donor Gametes,"I was not thinking of Russia
or the Holocaust or eugenics
when I picked the donor 
from an online catalog like 
I was ordering a new pair of shoes.
I don’t mean to sound blasé. 
It was more complicated than that. 
But by the time spring came 
and the third failed IVF, I didn’t care 
about SAT scores or eye color;
I wanted any embryo that latched
to my uterine wall and grew. 
The German philosophy major, 
the filmmaker from California, even 
the one whose favorite food was pork. 
What did genes matter? I already knew 
I’d name my second child for dead relatives 
from the old country, the ones
who made it out before the camps. 
My uterus washed with grief, empty 
kiddush cup after the seder. 
That was the only time I really prayed.  
That day when I paced outside, 
waiting for a call from my doctor 
with good news, eggs and sperm 
married in a petri dish, an offering 
from a Midwestern girl 
with ovarian abundance and kind eyes
who knew to look away."
Moon Tonight,"Moon tonight,
Beloved . . .
When twilight
Has gathered together
The ends
Of her soft robe
And the last bird-call
Has died.
Moon tonight—
Cool as a forgotten dream,
Dearer than lost twilights
Among trees where birds sing
No more."
I. Genesis: Animal Planet,"I rose up first in a big vacant state with an x in its middle
to mark the place I was born into dying
surrounded by oil refinery towers with flames
like giant birthday candles you could never
get big enough to blow out. Before I was
they were, and before them, reptiles and mammals
died and rotted and were crushed into carbon
then coal, then oil in the earth
whose deep core held bigger burning.
My daddy labored here, at The Gulf,
Which meant oil refinery, but also
a distance he drowned in,
caged inside this high hurricane fence.
In steel-toed boots for forty-two years, he walked.
The gold hatpin he got at retirement
had four diamond chips
for a smile and two rubies like eyes,
and he passed it to me
because it was a holy relic
of suffering and sacrifice,
so I wanted it most.
He breathed in this chemical stink
some sixteen hours or days on end
in a storm, and it perfumed his overalls.
The catalyst he pumped on the cracking unit
burst through with enormous pressure to break down
the black crude’s chemical bonds
into layers, into products,
and many ignorant men did twist the spigots
and unplug the clogs and keep it all
rivering so the buried pipes
could carry out so many flammables north—
North! Where books are written and read.
The sunset down here glows green and hard-washed
denim blue and the scalded pink of flesh.
 "
Rhythms (Section I),"The stars are hidden,
the lights are out;
the tall black houses
are ranked about.
I beat my fists
on the stout doors,
no answering steps
come down the floors.
I have walked until
I am faint and numb;
from one dark street
to another I come.
The comforting
winds are still.
This is a chaos
through which I stumble,
till I reach the void
and down I tumble.
The stars will then
be out forever;
the fists unclenched,
the feet walk never,
and all I say
blown by the wind
away."

Duane Linklater learns Ininīmowin from nohkomnânak mina nimôsomnânak—in close study—felt—over decades. (These ones, they stay with language through ongoing efforts to disrupt our bodies, our thinking, our lands.) We visit, our words, their energy, the incompleteness of translation, our radical love of breath in motion sound on air throat sweep and call. I hear drift and grain in vowels of silty river, spongy muskeg, windswept tamarack, clay that holds us as it held our ancestors. I am not a speaker of Ininīmowin nor am I Omaskeko—(gwi suk)—yet niwâhkomâwak."
Names for Hunger,"On the walk back from 
the therapist to the office
you rub your chest and say
It’ll be all right, my gurgush
There’s a clusterfuck waiting at work,
things that really aren’t personal
but slice you up anyway
You’ll be all right, my malai ka doona
It’ll all get done, my chhunmunita
You think of your mother
whose love birthed all these names
How often she hurt you
and it dawns on you, like a flash
of lightning on an airplane: 
love is a bagad billa
At the pantry, you feed yourself
a boxed lunch of baingan and channa
and remember how she once
stood at the door, hours 
after she locked you up in a room 
a plate of aloo parathas in her hand
and a look that said you were ok now,
the anger under your relief
You swallow the last morsel, feeling
it graze your heart.
Back at work, hungry again."
To Baudelaire,"The head is the body’s lair.
It may be slightly in front.
Milking these separations,
Words answer the immortal need
For intoxicating monotony. The body
Is the mind’s sieve.
Beloved grief, water drips
From a block of red ice
Onto a perfumed paradise
Lost in the obsessive embrace
Of reader and writer. Superb haloes
Hang from the heads
Of naked slaves whipping themselves.
A new world is required
To stomach the images
Floating on the headless
Torso of the old.
“I was surprised to find myself
Staring at an empty hole.
I ordered flowers.”"
Skull Song,"A sea-god, whose father had been a mortal, becomes a skeleton.
The skin of the sea was thick, to-night,
And the tone of the sea was dull;
When I found by the edge of the sullen sea
The half of a sea-god’s skull.
Half of a sea-god’s skull was there,
Half of a sea-god’s tail.
When I dug them out of the clutch of the sand
The peering moon went pale.
The peering moon went pale, because
Her other eye had seen
The other half of the sea-god’s bones
Ten thousand fathom green . . .
Ten thousand fathom green with sea,
The sea-god’s other bones
Swayed in a dead sea-goddess’s arms
On a pile of sea-washed stones.
The skin of the sea was thick, to-night,
And the tone of the sea was dull,
While I buried away from the sinister sea
All the mortal part of a skull."
Trainee,"The language has us by the throat,
Scorched utensils in a grid. Trained
Tracks, right of way, light
Of day. Enraged bodies whistle by
Cold soot, skipping space entirely.
Letters are so dense it’s convenient
To stop listening. Religious
Seduction scenarios replace
The melancholy human voice,
Its perfected products, trick photos.
Say I say sky, say the city
Of San Francisco sits beneath that.
Have you ever seen a school fence?
A sun set? Fields of speech
The anatomizing phonemes bark at.
A machine shop? In the light
Of the correct time, steel beams
Lift a low stone fog. Tires sing
On freeways that guard the views
From distressed housing.
Convinced condensed devices are at home
In our words. Not to be confused
With us or use. Remove
The caressed blossom, the rug’s still
Brand new, a vacuum.
 "
My One Voice,"At the sound of my voice
I spoke and, egged on
By the discrepancy, wrote
The rest out as poetry.
Read the books, duets
From nowhere say they speak;
Why not let them. Inhabited stares
Leave trees in rearview mirrors.
I came from a neutral point
In space, far from the inside
Of any one head. O say can I
Still see the tabula rasa outshining
That rosy dawn on the near side
Of the genetic code. Doubt,
Thy name is certainty. Generations
Of recordings of the sunrise
Picture the light until the page
Is white and I predict
The present, hearing a future
In the syllables’ erasing day."
"Senlin: A Biography (Part I, Section II)","It is morning, Senlin says, and in the morning
When the light drips through the shutters like the dew,
I arise, I face the sunrise,
And do the things my fathers learned to do.
Stars in the purple dusk above the rooftops
Pale in a saffron mist and seem to die,
And I myself on a swiftly tilting planet
Stand before a glass and tie my tie.
Vine leaves tap my window,
Dew-drops sing to the garden stones,
The robin chirps in the chinaberry tree
Repeating three clear tones.
It is morning. I stand by the mirror
And tie my tie once more.
While waves far off in a pale rose twilight
Crash on a white sand shore.
I stand by a mirror and comb my hair:
How small and white my face!—
The green earth tilts through a sphere of air
And bathes in a flame of space.
There are houses hanging above the stars
And stars hung under a sea . . .
And a sun far off in a shell of silence
Dapples my walls for me . . .
It is morning, Senlin says, and in the morning
Should I not pause in the light to remember god?
Upright and firm I stand on a star unstable,
He is immense and lonely as a cloud.
I will dedicate this moment before my mirror
To him alone, for him I will comb my hair.
Accept these humble offerings, cloud of silence!
I will think of you as I descend the stair.
Vine leaves tap my window,
The snail-track shines on the stones,
Dew-drops flash from the chinaberry tree
Repeating two clear tones.
It is morning, I awake from a bed of silence,
Shining I rise from the starless waters of sleep.
The walls are about me still as in the evening,
I am the same, and the same name still I keep.
The earth revolves with me, yet makes no motion,
The stars pale silently in a coral sky.
In a whistling void I stand before my mirror,
Unconcerned, and tie my tie. 
There are horses neighing on far-off hills
Tossing their long white manes,
And mountains flash in the rose-white dusk,
Their shoulders black with rains . . .
It is morning. I stand by the mirror
And surprise my soul once more;
The blue air rushes above my ceiling,
There are suns beneath my floor . . .
. . . It is morning, Senlin says, I ascend from darkness
And depart on the winds of space for I know not where,
My watch is wound, a key is in my pocket,
And the sky is darkened as I descend the stair.
There are shadows across the windows, clouds in heaven,
And a god among the stars; and I will go
Thinking of him as I might think of daybreak
And humming a tune I know . . .
Vine-leaves tap at the window,
Dew-drops sing to the garden stones,
The robin chirps in the chinaberry tree
Repeating three clear tones."

Why don’t you                  me I embroider
in green thread onto a yellow t-shirt 
on sale (jk I don’t do that. I pur-
chase bananas and toothpaste). Oh, 
is this where you go? I murmur 
to my car, who has a secret name. 
Can you hear me? I gesture
mutely to the parking lot. The trees
do not answer; they’re trees, 
                        and know better. "
Forest Starships,"(while wandering in the forest at Indian Point, Ellsworth, Maine)
Bats watched them fall, cupped like tiny palms, 
toward earthen forests. 
They land, eager ears up, 
on twigs and felled branches. 
They nestle between lichen, 
  fungi, 
  figure out hyphae, 
  the deep composting web. 
Once homed, aliens echolocate via sonar chirps, 
mimic
Blue Jay, 
Hairy Woodpecker, 
Song Sparrow, 
Black-Capped Chickadee, 
Northern Parula, 
the Black-Throated Green Warbler. 
Thin sound beams traverse the woods, establish generations, 
the milky way’s travelers in their new division. 
The trill of me, me, me, a tiny army of green shells, 
parsing old and new ocean kinships. 
And then they wait. 
Wood fibers decay, 
car tires feed carbon black into morning breezes, 
a hint of rock dust, 
rush hour exhaust fumes. 
They stir the pot, assemble new fuel,
toward the day that conflagration will send them,         
spores and all, 
  toward, 
  toward the orbit, 
  beyond it, 
  into nebulae, 
  closer, so much closer 
  into the dark."
All Souls’ Day in a German Town,"The leaves fall softly: a wind of sighs
Whispers the world’s infirmities,
Whispers the tale of the waning years,
While slow mists gather in shrouding tears
On All Souls’ Day; and the bells are slow
In steeple and tower. Sad folk go
Away from the township, past the mill,
And mount the slope of a grassy hill
Carved into terraces broad and steep,
To the inn where wearied travellers sleep,
Where the sleepers lie in ordered rows,
And no man stirs in his long repose.
They wend their way past the haunts of life,
Father and daughter, grandmother, wife,
To deck with candle and deathless cross,
The house which holds their dearest loss.
I, who stand on the crest of the hill,
Watch how beneath me, busied still,
The sad folk wreathe each grave with flowers.
Awhile the veil of the twilight hours
Falls softly, softly, over the hill,
Shadows the cross:—creeps on until
Swiftly upon us is flung the dark.
Then, as if lit by a sudden spark,
Each grave is vivid with points of light,
Earth is as Heaven’s mirror to-night;
The air is still as a spirit’s breath,
The lights burn bright in the realm of Death.
Then silent the mourners mourning go,
Wending their way to the church below;
While the bells toll out to bid them speed,
With eager Pater and prayerful bead,
The souls of the dead, whose bodies still
Lie in the churchyard under the hill;
While they wait and wonder in Paradise,
And gaze on the dawning mysteries,
Praying for us in our hours of need;
For us, who with Pater and prayerful bead
Have bidden those waiting spirits speed."
Gala Noise,"                                        I
All morning the off-tune brimful singing
rruh-khee, scre-chee, cruk-ah, uh-hoo, zurrah
clangs a ruckus over the dream of a collective tempo
and for a fraction of a second, we hear the affections
of a world aligned.

You’d think the sounds were from another century,
knowledge so clearly carried through them.

They resemble the embodied voices of mycelium
sending instructions about, morse code for roots
distributing seminal beliefs
as if they were explaining the strictures of priesthood
or the water table for static-screech cicadas
waiting for their stage appearance every twelve years.

If only we, like all creatures,
were untroubled by catastrophe,
and allowed the soil
to extract, from our marrow-bone bodies,
words that disappoint and words that rhyme.
                                       II
Every day at noon, the crystal mist burns off
high up by the campanile.
Lackadaisical days, sensational ways to feel
in greens and deeper greens.

But the warbling hoot and hiss and serenades we hear
convulse with something sinister we share,
that inner wrangling
shrieking on the sunglow slopes.

What spirit-noise this time permits.
What ordinary pain and ordinary tenderness
after all, remain
memory and memorial by singing and by sound."
Walking to Athena,"Rome rattlejacks in vernacular,
wishing in Latin, marching arm in arm
with ladybug faces and groomed suitcases.

Someone is playing Liszt from an upper floor
as if it’s 1840, when Hungary was a jigsaw of another place
but Liszt, arriving here, said Mendelssohn couldn’t play his rhapsody
competently, and trashed him as propaganda
before composing the loveliest lieder to his enemy.

Water blows over my skin.
Wind has picked up impressions of splashing
from sparkling drinks or the river I’m crossing.

What a ruckus I find on my stone-walking
visit to the marble Athena at the villa.
A sphinx has elicited Medusa
to petrify a centaur, who as usual is causing havoc
and even the Harpies have taken sides now.
They hang from rooftops, flapping with the laundry.
An old man looks up and drags his finger across his throat with a laugh.

Botanical fever sweeps in from the east,
explaining with the scent of pollen and magnolia
where the garden terrace begins.
A cook smoking on the corner invites me in.
He serves me the most delectable veal that falls off the bone
the way we all fall off the bone.
I put my feet in the cascading waterfall at the Spanish embassy
where a party festivalizes with blue drinks.

Last night, in the giant bed at the hotel,
I dreamed of end-times
and wished I were dreaming in the dream.

I hope Athena recognizes me.
We’re been talking on the phone for years.
Maybe she will say truth is in the psalms.
We always talk about the form of epics, their sing-song
revenge, and she likes to rave about Odysseus
who she loved most, and how he got his revenge.
But Dante got the last word, I argue,
by drowning Odysseus for advising his men to sail
beyond the knowable world, knowing they would end.

When we meet, I hope I have the courage to say
epics are the sea voyage of imagination
but all the songs are here.

I meet my Athena from the dawn of the first century.
She is larger than I expect and smaller
than the gold and ivory Athena
made in the fifth century BC for the Parthenon
that she was carved to resemble.

The sea voyage lieder Liszt arranged for Mendelssohn
feels so cleaved open as if it had forgotten
what to make of itself in the middle of composing."
Plum Cake,"I’d make a plum cake when she died,
a lamentation grief-bake, Kaddish through blood-recipe,
all of its colors shrieking at me; a sweet take on her love.
I gaze at the street. Tree branches out front are tangled,
my floor is slanted, my house-cage is so small and dark
for all the summits, slopes, and swamps of feeling.
I am not to be purple-plum-decided in any still-life of grief
or reminiscence, no waferlike religious feeling, never—
she will never be human again. I knew I wouldn’t make it.
Italian plums are sweetest. I should find them in a market
when days are longer; fruit-of-aging, gift-of-goodness.
A friend who lost a friend and made the cake said plum
six times in one paragraph, so full of yearning are our phrases.
Snow-bright is her hair on the bed, knobby knuckle-skin
folded on her chest. She’d be delighted to celebrate her death.
I love that, she’d say happily about the plum-cake wake.
Plums pooled around the cake-slab in the photograph,
bloody and marvellous. Skylight took her in. I couldn’t make it."
"Ode to Patrick Kearns, Funeral Director of the Leo F. Kearns Funeral Home, in Queens","By blood we go into the fabric of what once felt hymnal at worst;
we are tuned to higher pitches now, in languages invented,
not imagined rites of spring but last rites in strange establishments.
Trucks collect the dead and roll uptown to bury in a potter’s field
corpses we knew, and loved, their long solemn graves
together, better here than bodies shelved or stacks of flesh
shipped out of state to cremate or left to rot. We formalized obituaries
(she was first to graduate, he escaped, she was a composer, he,
though deaf, was a composer, too; we pray alone to keep their souls
alive) until this month. We lived in adverbs, dressed for rainshine
half the time and not according to the daily toll, not this running
tally, at scale in every borough. Our minds are lost to gravity
again. By gravity we live. We move from cell to fingers, toes,
our footprint handprint fingerprint alone identifies us as one
person in this widening morgue; you men and women of generations,
ever upward, we say now; if Whitman could, he’d hold us dear,
our arms, our feet, our hands, our fingerprinted fingers wrapped in his—
“myself disintegrated, every one disintegrated yet part of the scheme”—
and renew us with varied meanings, rebellious curiosities;
I will miss him in my future, if it is me, and in twenty or a hundred years,
history will ask: How did we wear on with so much
weeping? It was never so beautiful as this April
in the park with yellow oaks deliriously blooming
despite the trill of siren after siren to the east; we ignored it,
walking west or north, southeast, any which way
someone else wasn’t. Sunlight far-flung itself
sideways across the arms-up oaks and Olmsted’s slopes;
oh I was rapt, convinced this surreal afternoon was magic-cast
in lavender and grass-green thickening itself, cardinals flying
straight up into that vanishing we are all doing now,
minding our eternities—transcendent limbo, this,
but cherish the eclipse, our orbit moving over
our polyphonic voices in fugue-walking choices, prelude
to nothing, yes, nothing, because when the wind is all C major
unravelling in D minor, we are in the neuro-beat of wondering
who will stay today and who departs tomorrow, but here
are my children, my coffin, my love, it doesn’t matter what color
the coffin is or that we swooned too long in idioms; we broke
on counterpoint and this is where it leads. I swear
this is not my story. On our tombstones, what do we see?
What we love most is always free and far irrational,
fine with me. What is true today
if not my teeth, my bones, my nothingness? Is it near?
I must endear myself. I’ll think, oh, it wasn’t me, I was
just a sentence after all. But my sentence: Was it wrong?
I am young to be this old, too old to be that young.
When we are all accounted for, someone will surely say:
Unevenly I conclude we count facts because we cannot lose our minds
in facts; we lose them in the vivid air, thousands elsewhere."
Landscape with Double Bow,"Rondeau is what you really want, solo and refrain,
we and each the musical improvisation of the operatic day,
sonic scavenging and comedic jigging inside some Beckett
of one another; oh, wouldn’t it be grand to be a whole note
dragged across the bridge of your singular, sound-expanding
double bow, to be orchestral, to be drunk, to drink the velvet sun
from the arbor trellis; fruit-of-purple grapes we plucked—
bunches of dolce to color our throats and that improvised
word-spun truth I, terrified, say I can’t derive on cue: death,
light, blueprints that fit the choral codes of what music thinks
writing is about. We twisted grape notes so easily off their stems,
screw of death in cupped hands. We follow seductions of light—
You move above and underneath the strings in sea strokes.
One bow was not enough to match the warmth two bows create,
so you invented ways to get more harmony, upper bow and under bow
independent but close, staccato and legato, legato and staccato,
to choose a way to hear the world and harvest sound in it—
curve of bow, curve of earth, curves your eyes interpret as ultraviolet—
Still you want more color, more sound to harvest, more distortion.
Pale-blue resonators you sculpted in local clay, land-in-sky
blue above the land, distort the sound you widened already.
You are looking for a vibration lower than what the lowest string
is tuned to, pitched so low your ear can’t find it—
imagination, lore, solo of magma, baritone of fantasia.
I cannot rogue my syllables and improvise around
temptation ears like yours but love the glut, the secret, the grand
distortions of your polyphonic heart, which believes in ghost tones.
What is true? Grapes chandelier from the arbor
and ripen on the tongue. We jammed the grapes inside a bowl,
so plentiful, and ate their tiny hearts at lunch."
Van Gogh’s Violin,"GOOD
Good morning, Vincent
It is early May, 1889
Time to get up and paint
Wheat Field with Rising Sun
Hurry before all the firmament
Starts to fall apart again
Right now it’s all singing
“Good morning, Vincent!”
  YES YET
This remarkable day
Goes between
Because I paint it
With me in it
  PERFECTLY GREAT
It would be great
To eat an apple
But there in the tree
It is perfect
Flesh covers face
Wheat covers field
  PARTICLE BREAD

My nose sticks out
      A doorknob
As my poor ear grows
Like a worm back to my head
A crack, that is my brow
And yesterday is my lips
And my teeth are rocks
      I walk on
  MISANTHROPE, OR . . .
Shy of people
Friend to star in sky
Where am I?
In a park watching children
Play without thinking
  PAINT TOUNGE
I cannot stop
To think
  DETAIL
Black bites deeper
Spitting red beside my bed
Struggling through deep forest
Limb line limn time
It’s all detail! Everything!
  HEIGHTENED WITH WHITE CHALK
Running chalk over my lips
Ecstasy directly transmitted
To grass blade after blade
  INTERRUPT DREAM
All joy of LIFE flashes
Blinding revelation green
Simply morning, all the
Racket, all the LANGUAGE
Broken dream pours in
Nothing holds blue
Corners of REALITY
As I reach out, brush
One more tree in the garden
Under the masterful Sun
  IT’S IMPORTANT
To put up with everything
As you get it down on paper
  LAST PASS
Plow down the sun
Second wind, Old Bay
Last pass on this acre
Go home, go home
Wait—gold. More gold!
  POTATO IN SKY
The back of the shed
Needs painting
What next!
  PLYING MY TRADE
If I sit here long enough
Maybe I’ll figure out what it is
  SHEAVES OF WHEAT
There is no stopping now
What I want is everything
And everything is arriving
At once to me

Faces in the Street,"They lie, the men who tell us in a loud decisive tone
That want is here a stranger, and that misery’s unknown;
For where the nearest suburb and the city proper meet
My window-sill is level with the faces in the street—
                Drifting past, drifting past,
                To the beat of weary feet—
While I sorrow for the owners of those faces in the street.
And cause I have to sorrow, in a land so young and fair,
To see upon those faces stamped the marks of Want and Care;
I look in vain for traces of the fresh and fair and sweet
In sallow, sunken faces that are drifting through the street—
                Drifting on, drifting on,
                To the scrape of restless feet;
I can sorrow for the owners of the faces in the street.
In hours before the dawning dims the starlight in the sky
The wan and weary faces first begin to trickle by,
Increasing as the moments hurry on with morning feet,
Till like a pallid river flow the faces in the street—
                Flowing in, flowing in,
                To the beat of hurried feet—
Ah! I sorrow for the owners of those faces in the street.
The human river dwindles when ’tis past the hour of eight,
Its waves go flowing faster in the fear of being late;
But slowly drag the moments, whilst beneath the dust and heat
The city grinds the owners of the faces in the street—
                Grinding body, grinding soul,
                Yielding scarce enough to eat—
Oh! I sorrow for the owners of the faces in the street.
And then the only faces till the sun is sinking down
Are those of outside toilers and the idlers of the town,
Save here and there a face that seems a stranger in the street,
Tells of the city’s unemployed upon his weary beat—
                Drifting round, drifting round,
                To the tread of listless feet—
Ah! My heart aches for the owner of that sad face in the street.
And when the hours on lagging feet have slowly dragged away,
And sickly yellow gaslights rise to mock the going day,
Then flowing past my window like a tide in its retreat,
Again I see the pallid stream of faces in the street—
                Ebbing out, ebbing out,
                To the drag of tired feet,
While my heart is aching dumbly for the faces in the street.
And now all blurred and smirched with vice the day’s sad pages end,
For while the short ‘large hours’ toward the longer ‘small hours’ trend,
With smiles that mock the wearer, and with words that half entreat,
Delilah pleads for custom at the corner of the street—
                Sinking down, sinking down,
                Battered wreck by tempests beat—
A dreadful, thankless trade is hers, that Woman of the Street.
But, ah! to dreader things than these our fair young city comes,
For in its heart are growing thick the filthy dens and slums,
Where human forms shall rot away in sties for swine unmeet,
And ghostly faces shall be seen unfit for any street—
                Rotting out, rotting out,
                For the lack of air and meat—
In dens of vice and horror that are hidden from the street.
I wonder would the apathy of wealthy men endure
Were all their windows level with the faces of the Poor?
Ah! Mammon’s slaves, your knees shall knock, your hearts in terror beat,
When God demands a reason for the sorrows of the street,
                The wrong things and the bad things
                And the sad things that we meet
In the filthy lane and alley, and the cruel, heartless street.
I left the dreadful corner where the steps are never still,
And sought another window overlooking gorge and hill;
But when the night came dreary with the driving rain and sleet,
They haunted me—the shadows of those faces in the street,
                Flitting by, flitting by,
                Flitting by with noiseless feet,
And with cheeks but little paler than the real ones in the street.
Once I cried: ‘Oh, God Almighty! if Thy might doth still endure,
Now show me in a vision for the wrongs of Earth a cure.’
And, lo! with shops all shuttered I beheld a city’s street,
And in the warning distance heard the tramp of many feet,
                Coming near, coming near,
                To a drum’s dull distant beat,
And soon I saw the army that was marching down the street.
Then, like a swollen river that has broken bank and wall,
The human flood came pouring with the red flags over all,
And kindled eyes all blazing bright with revolution’s heat,
And flashing swords reflecting rigid faces in the street.
                Pouring on, pouring on,
                To a drum’s loud threatening beat,
And the war-hymns and the cheering of the people in the street.
And so it must be while the world goes rolling round its course,
The warning pen shall write in vain, the warning voice grow hoarse,
But not until a city feels Red Revolution’s feet
Shall its sad people miss awhile the terrors of the street—
                The dreadful everlasting strife
                For scarcely clothes and meat
In that pent track of living death—the city’s cruel street."
The Earth,"What can I tell her over breakfast when she says
her son suffers from madness, and because there
is no mental health, he has ended up in jail,
and she is relieved, because at least he might
be safe there or he might get to see the doctor.
We are eating egg-white omelets; we are counting
carbs. We are buttoning ourselves in our clean dresses
and high-heeled shoes in order to bring home the bacon,
doing what we need to do and “It is what it is.”
Her granddaughter and daughter are living with her
in the one bedroom. Nights, the daughter lounges by
the pool, looking at her phone, while she teaches the child
to plant seeds in a flower bed she feels bad she does not own.
She tells she cried in the car coming here; she did not know
me then. She thought we would be talking to each other
the whole time about what we are selling, what
the other might buy, but somehow we left that behind
over the toast with the tiny pots of strawberry jam.
Who can explain all this luxury, all this despair?
Or how we all hold our secret shames so close
and gloss our lips with “Cinnamon Fire” as if that were
some legitimate form of protection. Cinnamon Fire!
She just turned fifty. I tell her wait ten years—you
won’t know more, but you will get closer to forgiving,
because it is all happening on a wheel that spins
so fast. Why not stop to look at the pink flowers
you’ve planted with your granddaughter? Why not feel
your bare toes in the good wet earth? We play with the crusts
on our plates. The waitress takes the coffee away. We
are strangers again, each carrying our lonely fear
our children won’t find their way, wishing for them
some inner logic—sacred trust of earth and self, that exists
for each of us so far within, so far under the skin, we
can’t even begin to say what it is made of; it merely is,
poised between love and grief: the blue space we call wonder,
which is merely the dew on the grass, the shadow the sun
makes as it rolls over the vast skin of the Earth."
Louise,"Dedamet. I saw you, after the first flush of blooms.
I was picking through the ruins for my roots but you weren’t there.
Must I make an agreement with the living?
I cut the spike.
I surrendered to your dormancy.
Later, I cooed at the new growing from the old.
I kissed each bud as they swelled and broke, one at a time, to reveal the private ledger of your birth.
Without documentation. Without the truckloads of gravel between us, pinning our bodies in place.
When white flowers unfurled again, I stayed on the threshold of memory.
I didn’t have to give up anything. Not my pursuit of facts. Not my wildness.
I let the unexpected take shape: a mirror-image symmetry betraying your face.
What can I learn from your living? Your vagaries and blossoms?
I reach for you, madare madar bozorgam. Toward a past swallowed by stone. Unmapped yet in the earth. The orchid, my promise to care for that which animates us both. 
I promise to wrest you from the hands of those who would rewrite your life. No. No. I promise:
I promise touch. I promise my voice. I promise a willingness to dream.
I promise your face hewn into lost history."
The Bearing Edge,"For DJ
My son starts every conversation  
with the statement “I love you, Dad.”  
“I love you, Dad. What’s for dinner tonight?”  
“I love you, Dad. Is it supposed to rain?”  
“I love you, Dad. Can we go for a walk?”  
“I love you, Dad, but you really have to chill.”  
He’s like the guy who wears a bow tie  
to the bar and to the beach.  
He’s a dandy of affection, at once  
rolling up his pennies and spending them  
on ice cream. He’ll wear this phrase  
to heaven (he’s already been to hell—  
what he calls fostercareless). If  
Orpheus had a lyre, then he has a bearing  
edge. He will not drum without it:  
“I love you, Dad.” 
He moves forward by glancing back, 
and no one is ever lost. 
The sky sells cotton candy;  
the trees, shade. 
Love—it’s a kind of leash, invisible,  
expanding, and I’m his big, happy dog."

"My Friend, Her Grandson","Brigantine Beach
I.
The wind is blue.
Blue, the boy tells me.
It dusts the reed-filled dunes,
then scuds across sand to water’s edge.
II.
We lie on the beach. Gray waves
advance, retreat. The blue wind, salt scrub,
scours my skin. Sharks troll for toddlers.
Patrol planes hum below the cloudy scrim.

I climb the jetty’s ragged point.
From the churning reef,
I find the boy, a speck on the shore,
asleep on a blue cot.

The Author’s Picture,"While in my matchless graces wrapt I stand,
And touch each feature with a trembling hand;
Deign, lovely self! with art and nature’s pride,
To mix the colours, and the pencil guide.
Self is the grand pursuit of half mankind;
How vast a crowd by self, like me, are blind!
By self, the fop, in magic colours shown,
Tho’, scorn’d by ev’ry eye, delights his own:
When age and wrinkles seize the conqu’ring maid,
Self, not the glass, reflects the flatt’ring shade.
Then, wonder-working self! begin the lay;
Thy charms to others, as to me, display.
Straight is my person, but of little size;
Lean are my cheeks, and hollow are my eyes;
My youthful down is, like my talents, rare;
Politely distant stands each single hair.
My voice, too rough to charm a lady’s ear;
So smooth, a child may listen without fear;
Not form’d in cadence soft and warbling lays,
To sooth the fair thro’ pleasure’s wanton ways.
My form so fine, so regular, so new;
My port so manly, and so fresh my hue;
Oft, as I meet the crowd, they laughing say,
“See, see Memento Mori cross the way.”
The ravished Proserpine at last, we know,
Grew fondly jealous of her sable beau;
But, thanks to nature! none from me need fly;
One heart the devil could wound—so cannot I.
Yet, tho’ my person fearless may be seen,
There is some danger in my graceful mien:
For, as some vessel toss’d by wind and tide,
Bounds o’er the waves, and rocks from side to side;
In just vibration thus I always move:
This who can view, and not be forc’d to love?
Hail! charming self! by whose propitious aid
My form in all its glory stands display’d:
Be present still; with inspiration kind,
Let the same faithful colours paint the mind.
Like all mankind, with vanity I’m bless’d;
Conscious of wit I never yet possess’d.
To strong desires my heart an easy prey,
Oft feels their force, but never owns their sway.
This hour, perhaps, as death I hate my foe;
The next I wonder why I should do so.
Tho’ poor, the rich I view with careless eye;
Scorn a vain oath, and hate a serious lie.
I ne’er, for satire, torture common sense;
Nor show my wit at God’s, nor man’s expence.
Harmless I live, unknowing and unknown;
Wish well to all, and yet do good to none.
Unmerited contempt I hate to bear;
Yet on my faults, like others, am severe.
Dishonest flames my bosom never fire;
The bad I pity, and the good admire;
Fond of the muse, to her devote my days,
And scribble—not for pudding, but for praise.
These careless lines, if any virgin hears,
Perhaps, in pity to my joyless years,
She may consent a gen’rous flame to own,
And I no longer sigh the nights alone.
But, should the fair, affected, vain, or nice,
Scream with the fears inspir’d by frogs or mice;
Cry, Save us, heav’n! a spectre, not a man!
Her hartshorn snatch, or interpose her fan:
If I my tender overture repeat;
O! may my vows her kind reception meet!
May she new graces on my form bestow,
And, with tall honours, dignify my brow!"
On the Death of Sir Erasmus Philips,"Unfortunately drowned in the River Avon, near Bath, October 15, 1743
Why dash the floods! What cries my soul affright!
How steep the precipice! How dark the night!
Then Virtue sunk in Avon’s fatal wave,
No friend to succour, no kind hand to save; 
The circling waters hide his sinking head,
The treach’rous bottom forms his oozy bed. 
Behold the bloated corpse, the visage pale; 
See here what virtue, wealth, and birth avail.
What now remains beneath this load of pain?
To weep is nature, but to weep is vain.
What now remains? It yet remains to try 
What hope, what peace, religion can supply: 
It yet remains to catch the parting ray,
To note his worth ere mem’ry fade away,
To mark how various excellence combin’d, 
Recount his virtues, and transcribe his mind. 
It yet remains with holy rites to lay,
The breathless reliques in their kindred day.
Ye wise, ye good, the holy rites attend,
Here lies the wise man’s guide, the good man’s friend.
Awhile let faith exalt th’ adoring eye, 
And meditation deep suspend the sigh;
Then close the grave, and sound the fun’ral knell,
Each drop a tear, and take a last farewell; 
In peace retire, and wish to live as well."
The Sluggard,"’Tis the voice of the Sluggard: I heard him complain,
“You have wak’d me too soon, I must slumber again;”
As the door on its hinges, so he on his bed,
Turns his sides, and his shoulders, and his heavy head.
“A little more sleep, a little more slumber,”
Thus he wastes half his days and his hours without number;
And when he gets up he sits folding his hands,
Or walks about saunt’ring, or trifling he stands.
I pass’d by his garden, and saw the wild brier,
The thorn and the thistle, grow broader and higher.
The clothes that hang on him are turning to rags:
And his money still wastes, till he starves or he begs.
I made him a visit still hoping to find
He had took better care for improving his mind:
He told me his dreams, talk’d of eating and drinking;
But he scarce reads his Bible, and never loves thinking.
Said I then to my heart, “Here’s lesson for me;
That man’s but a picture of what I might be:
But thanks to my friends for their care in my breeding,
Who taught me betimes to love working and reading."
Wail,"for the young who ask, “How did you learn to like yourself?”
There are glaciers, imposing, yet shrinking.
There is the iris, violet sky cradling shards of sun.
The white Bengal tiger, snow and black ink.
Infinite reasons I could give for gladness,
though none may salve the wound from which
your question arises, how to be glad to be alive?
Stitch your heart’s fissure: recall family, friends,
a slap, cigarette burn, the rod, something smashed 
down, or welled up in your darkened pupil.
Turn outward: two A.M. streets, the creeps in cars,
the chaos of human folly delivered by calm,
coiffed news anchors. The wound is within you
and not. The answer within you and not.
Want, comfort, desire, love ought not be wounds.
We pine for them from our first wail,
what you must give and take, till no voice is left."
The Genie Speaks,"I will start again tomorrow, after waking under
the fingernails of Scheherazade. Small things
will become large, and large things will become
themselves. It is an old story and familiar, despite
how much I hate being divided. Here I am, despite
how much I should not be. At this moment, I am
reaching far into a page that is oozing like honey-
comb. If you will pardon my hyperbole, there are
leaves of something that matters, I do not know
what, blowing in every direction. At the foretold
moment, our other earth opens a secret hand. If
there is a purpose, we will know it soon enough,
although not knowing feels satisfactory and good:
better than good, I am tempted to say to the bees."
The Caseworker Speaks of a Good Fit,"Morning laps at its bowl of water.
The lake eagerly greets the shore.
A man in his bathrobe does the daily puzzle,
the smell of coffee—six across.
A boy upstairs lingers in bed.
The warmth of the sheets envelops him.
“How many letters?” “Does it fit?”
The promise of pancakes—four across.
He had dreamt forever of a scene like this:
family, food, a true-green home.
(Violence: that’s a cross word puzzle.
The way he’d cry—eleven down.)
Late afternoon. The wind picks up.
A single blank remains.
“I think I’ve got it. Everything fits!”
His heart billows like a sail."
Parasitoid,"Her father said don’t stay out late,
his hand too long on her shoulder.  
I would have driven a mower into the side
of his blue Camaro but my feet couldn’t 
reach the pedals. I could have punched
high enough to graze the perfect arc
of his jaw, but I wasn’t strong yet. 
My mother promised me height,
a broad chest, and hands big enough 
to sing all the songs of war.
His smile swung its hook above us,
so we leapt gates, she and I.
Pretend you’re a scorpion
and I’ll be the peregrine, talons out.
You can’t hide!
Our paths tore grass,
crazed gnats in the fallow. 
Deer flies followed us back home 
and needled into dreams in which 
we shed skin like wool and writhed 
under pins and wires—because bugs have bugs
that bite ‘em. I dreamt of feeding pieces
of myself into the mouth of a beast 
until the beast outweighed my fear.  
When we woke starred with bites, her father 
flung her against the wall as if to slap dust
off a rug. His handprint on her faded slow 
as water off a handkerchief. The things 
we were taught had something to do 
with mosquitos hurtling themselves at us
like there was a law for it, with her mother
dozing in the window, and with what touch does
to make a girl a castaway bird, grieving 
from the boughs, an out-in-the-open orphan 
gentling toward a dying time.  
I couldn’t muster the courage to ask 
how she could still vault a rain barrel in sheer glee. 
Only allowed to finger the last knot of her hair, 
I kept chasing till my legs were a twist 
of nerves and brittle gears.
I am neither strong nor tall 
and my hands can’t grasp 
beyond the quiet in us, wary as deer 
in the clearing where she’d command me 
to undress. Lay down. Don’t move. 
I wanted to believe wasps could fumble 
painlessly against us like snow 
tumbled from the leaves’ miscellaneous hands. 
She wanted to be dangerous, the one 
giving orders, and so on ad infinitum . . ."
Ship/Plum,"the ears lie but claim
the eyes lie or perhaps the body
either way the world is a ship
I call it “vestibular unease”
as I glance smartly over my glasses
motionsick in my stationary body
the fancy word just means
I live on a yellow submarine
not quite as glamorous as it sounds
you should be able to sink
your heels pleasurably into the floor
enjoy the solidity of the world
reality is not supposed to have give
like an overripe plum
I prefer wooden floors to marble
but even plastic laminate is okay
it keeps you upright and springy
I refuse to live on a ship/plum
I have no navigatory skills
and I don’t want to be the stone
inside gooey fruitflesh
straight horizons should be
mandated by law
don’t make the world turn wrinkly
like my fingers after bathing
I crave stability but
refuse to be the stone"
To a Bride,"Thou askest, O my friend, a song to-day;
But what soft note, what subtle melody
Can thy young heart’s delicious joy convey?
In Life’s enchanted lyre, one chord alone
Can thrill thee with a music all its own,
And fill thine heart with one most perfect tone.
What need, then, hast thou that I sing to thee?
June roses for thy bridal, fair to see,
Are sweeter music than my notes can be;
And song-birds flitting thro’ the fragrant air,
And stars that gleam, like living eyes, from where
Thine own turn softly in thy troth-plight prayer.
Then silence, sweeter than all varied sound,
Shall fold thee soft, like loving arms around,
For life’s most perfect gift thy heart hath found."
On Finding My Father’s First Essay,"It must have been hard for him on days 
when the sun hit the muddy delta, 
sending up what smelled like failure, 
rotten and man-made. Still, he drove 
his old, rusty car down Pacific to 
the college, where he sat by those 
half his age who knew little of how 
they would begin, how easily beginnings 
turn into a thousand dark miles of water.
But they knew school, much more about it
than he did-which words to use when, 
how to give nothing but the requirement, 
to hide between clauses and commas.
This was his mistake of the essay 
called “What Life Means to Me”:
         My shadow on the ocean’s face, the frayed 
         water behind a boat. Rainbows and valleys 
         and leis for my daughters, that they forgive 
         me for leaving and all that I couldn’t give.
Some nameless face read through it, asking 
for predicates, circling fragments, then went on, 
knowing our father’s tears, yet deeming them
unremarkable. I can see his hands thumbing 
the red-marked page, searching for a glimpse 
of understanding and finding none, his face 
burning with shame for not knowing how much 
it would take to begin again, to go back across 
the water. He must have left that day thinking 
he had to work even harder for our love, to be 
a real father, responsible and clean as grammar."
The Maze,"I saw the
dead bird on the sidewalk
his neck uncovered
and prehistoric
At seven in the morning
my hair was bound
against the fish in the air
who begged for the ocean
I longed for their place
Behind the
tall thin muslin of the curtain
we could see his shadow
knocking
and we waited
not stirring
crouched by the fireplace
where the ashes blew out
later we checked the harbor
to see if it was safe
rather hoping
one had gone astray
and flung itself upon the shore
for all to watch
If I should weep
they would never know
and so I walked
silently
shrugging off hands
in treacherous places
wanting to fall
In Williamsburg, Virginia
my uncle
pointed out the Maze
which grew
in the dead
governor’s garden
delighted
I went to it
and stood 
poised
inside the
precise
entrance
like a long hallway
the tightly trimmed
bushes
held themselves
pointing each
leaf
and twig
in an unquestioning manner
white gravel
caressed my feet
the sky disappeared
and I
could hear
the sound of water
rushing
I knew each corner
without pausing
Held captive in a cave
Ulysses
sobbed for his wife
who was singing high
melodies
from the center of a 
cobweb shawl
of their design 
three feathers
I picked
from a stone
in my path
and turning at last
I saw
the speckled bench
and halting fountain
which marked 
the end.
She
tortures
the curtains of the window
shreds them
like some
insane insect
creates a 
demented web
from the thin folds
her possessed fingers
clawing she
thrusts them away with
sharp jabs of long pins
to the walls. 
   "
Pō,"Before the land was tamed by industry, 
the oceanside resorts and pineapple plantations, 
before the cane knife's rust, the dark time of sickness, 
the coming of cannons, the bitter waters drunk, 
before the metallic salt of blood, the rain emptied 
into rivers, the winds carved valleys and mountains, 
before the earth spurted fire, birthed islands, 
her churning magma and her inner core of iron, 
before the stars dwarved, their coronas ignited, 
before the centripetal spin of galaxies, 
the unwinding gestures of time and space, 
before the light and heat-
There was darkness without breath and Pō, 
pressing the entirety of a universe into a shell 
the size of an atomic nucleus, waiting."
History of Language,"translated from the Italian by Will Schutt.
To Patrizia

In Chiasso, in an anonymous 
courtyard at the close 
of the ‘50s, kids 
play, scaling
fences and beating rugs 
in a puff of iron and grass.
The afternoon undying. Relentless 
sheep-shaped clouds in the sky.
Relentless games.
They climb the fence and hook 
their knees over the crossbeams 
heads down arms dangling 
and in their irrepressible 
small voices shout 
we’re monkeys
beautiful brown apes orango-tangos 
tiny monkeys doing the Petash 
and laugh in the late postwar period.
“Petacci!” they’re corrected 
by a mother with a long memory.
“Play all you want, don’t hurt yourselves, 
but it’s called ‘Do the Petacci.’ And remember, 
she wasn’t the only one 
to hang.”
      Storia della lingua 
A Patrizia

A Chiasso, in un cortile 
qualunque dentro gli ultimi 
anni ’50 bimbi
giocano arrampicandosi
sui tralicci per battere i tappeti 
nel fiato d’erba e ferro.
Eterno il pomeriggio, inarrestabili 
i cirri lungo il cielo a pecorelle,
inarrestabili i giochi.
Salgono su si appendono 
a gancio coi ginocchi sulle sbarre 
la testa in giù le braccia a penzoloni 
e con le loro garrule 
vocine urlano al mondo
siamo scimmie
belle bertucce brune oranghi tanghi, 
siamo scimmiette che fanno la petàce 
e ridono nel tardo dopoguerra.
“Petacci” li corregge
altissima una mamma non immemore.
“Giocate pure allegri non fatevi male, 
però si dice fare la Petacci: e ricordatevi 
che lei non era sola 
a dondolare”."
Stellar Body,"translated from the Italian by Will Schutt.
You pursue me with a thought, are a thought 
that comes to me without thinking, like a shiver 
you slowly scorch my skin and lead my eyes 
toward a clear point of light. You’re a memory 
retrieved and glowing, you’re my dream 
beyond dreams and memories, the door that closes 
and opens onto a wild river. You’re something 
no word can express, and in every word you resonate 
like the echo of a slow exhale, you’re my wind 
rustling the spring foliage, the voice that calls 
from a place I do not know but recognize as mine.
You’re the howl of a wolf, the voice of the deer 
alive and mortally wounded. My stellar body.
    Corpo Stellare 
Mi segui con un pensiero, sei un pensiero 
che non devo nemmeno pensare, come un brivido 
mi strini piano la pelle, muove gli occhi 
verso un punto chiaro di luce. Sei un ricordo 
perduto e luminoso, sei il mio sogno 
senza sogno e senza ricordi, la porta che chiude 
e apre sulla corrente di un fiume impetuoso. Sei una cosa 
che nessuna parola può dire e che in ogni parola 
risuona come l’eco di un lento respiro, sei il mio vento 
di foglie e primavere, la voce che chiama 
da un posto che non so e riconosco e che è mio.
Sei l’ululato di un lupo, la voce del cervo 
vivo e ferito a morte. Il mio corpo stellare."
Brief Homage to Pluto,"translated from the Italian by Will Schutt.
1
Don’t go down again. Here, 
on this windy night,
somewhere on a night of never-ending 
headlights and roads, Pluto
is waiting down below for you to rise.
Down below—if he remains 
in his enclosure. This is how
it must be. Don’t go down again, go on.
Toward your days, yours alone and no one’s.
Toward sweeter nights to divvy up 
with others, like fruit. Don’t go down again, 
go on.
  2
Because rain, because wind and valleys 
at night, yellow grass, breath. That water 
raking the alleys and fields. Because 
there is no truce or tomorrow. Only 
these bars, the cage of an I.
Hell is not being others, 
watching them slip by and disappear:
a parking lot that slowly empties, 
the windblown worksite.
  3
Opening your hand, that’s the hard part. Releasing
something without sacrifice, without 
deceit. Being the face
that fades from you, the wing that flits away, the cry 
that does not cry for you.
    Breve omaggio a Plutone 
  1
Non ridiscendere. Qui 
nella notte del vento, 
da qualche parte nella notte, lunga 
di fari e strade, Plutone
aspetta che tu sali, più in basso.
Più in basso: se resta 
nel suo chiuso. Dev’essere 
così: non ridiscendere, vai.
Verso i tuoi giorni, solo tuoi e di nessuno.
Verso altre notti più dolci da spezzare 
come un frutto, con altri. Non ridiscendere, 
vai.
  2
Perché la pioggia, perché il vento e le pianure 
notturne, l’erba gialla, il respiro. Quell’acqua 
che scroscia nei vicoli, e i prati. Perché 
non c’è tregua, o domani. Soltanto 
le sbarre, la gabbia di un io.
L’inferno è non essere gli altri, 
guardarli passare e sparire nel niente:
un posteggio che piano si svuota, 
il cantiere del vento.
  3
Aprire la mano: questo è difficile. Lasciare 
qualcosa senza sacrificio, senza 
falsità. Essere il volto
che si allontana da te, l’ala che sfugge, il pianto 
che non piange per te."
Witness,"translated from the Italian by Will Schutt.
Convincing  him  was  hard, in  the end  laziness and  that clot  of 
shame and fear won out. There’s nothing to worry about,  we said, 
just  tell her  what you’ve always  told us.  Omit the names,  fumble 
the telling.  At least it won’t have been pointless,  it won’t be forgot-
ten. And we  reminded him of  what seemed to us the  most  impor-
tant details:  the ice,  the  frostbite,  the  maggot  soup in Metz,  his
escape in an officer’s uniform,  the SS on the trolley from  Como to
Cernobbio,  the smuggler in the woods  along the border.  Or some 
of what got  said,  like  “Shoot me, go on, shoot me”  and  “I spit  in 
your face,  I spit on you”  (though that  was  much earlier,  involved 
a factory,  a secret war).  For our part, we wanted to know who had 
pulled the strings and  why and who had sat in the best seats,  fac-
ing the  orchestra.  Most of all we wanted  him to make sense of  it, 
to see the salamanders had made it through the fire. The  wormery.
      At  first  there  was a  problem with the  microphone;  next,  the 
sound test.  Embarrassment.  The journalist  was kind,  she  under-
stood.  Relax,  she kept saying,  there’s no rush.  Whenever you’re 
ready.  And then,  having finally  made up his mind,  looking  at her 
for what  may  have  been the first time,  recovering his voice  from 
a dusty, deep recess, he spoke slowly: Go away. Go away, please, 
his minute.
     I think that was the last he spoke of it.
    Il Testimone 
L’avevamo  convinto  con  difficoltà,   vincendo  la  pigrizia  e  quel 
grumo di  vergogna  e  paura.  Non  devi  preoccuparti,  dicevamo:
bastano le  cose  che  ci hai  raccontato così spesso.  Anche senza 
nome,  anche  dette  male.  Che almeno non sia stato inutile,  non 
vada perduto.  E gli ricordavamo i  fatti che ci erano  sembrati  più 
importanti:  il  ghiaccio,  il  congelamento,  la minestra  di  vermi  a 
Metz, la fuga con la divisa da ufficiale,  I’SS sul filobus tra Como e 
Cernobbio,  il contrabbandiere nei boschi del confine.  O certe bat-
tute, come “sparami, sparami pure”, e (ma quella era venuta molto 
prima,  centrava una  fabbrica,  una più  sorda guerra)  “ti sputo  in 
faccia, ti sputo”.  Poi avremmo voluto sapere,  in fondo,  anche noi, 
chi aveva mosso i fili: perché, e chi si era seduto nei posti  migliori, 
davanti all’orchestra. E che lo  capisse lui, soprattutto:  le  vedesse, 
le  salamandre che  avevano  attraversato  le fiamme. Il  verminaio.
     All’inizio  ci  fu qualche  problema  col microfono;  poi,  la  prova 
della voce. L’imbarazzo. La giornalista era gentile, capiva. Si rilassi, 
ripeteva,  non c’è fretta;  quando  vuole. Ma lui,  finalmente  deciso,
guardandola  forse per  la prima volta,  tirando fuori la voce  da  un 
deposito abbandonato, lontanissimo, disse adagio: se ne vada. Se 
ne vada, per favore, subito.
     Poi, credo, non se ne parlò più."
Diaspora Sonnet at the Feeders Before the Freeze,"I’m getting cold and the trees have darkened
into a tobacco-colored stain. Birds
cease calling each other—no more ears
in the branches. I haven’t slept for two nights
because their silence skewers everything.
My thoughts cannot be broken. The depths
of my thinking sink me. I hold firm
despite the rain, its dissolution.
There are no sparrows or chickadees, they
no longer fling back their heads, exalted.
Where have they gone? The birds and the finery
of their throats? Their gratitude for seed and suet?"
Diaspora Sonnet Imagining My Father’s Uncertainty and Nothing Else,"On condition of anonymity
we are conditioned by antonyms. There,
the thing made—villainous and ill-tempered.
Repulsive. We’re made beasts. Formed from many
scales. How does one love a thing that loves nothing?
Made from the wrack and wreck of you—image
of you, and sent by you to fight your fights,
thus we are all parts and parts. Hibernal
and truant, until your remembrances
have mislaid all the best of you into
us. Tilt our heads, turned this way and that, see
all our old stitching come undone. Our sons—
they see the made thing we have become, hurt
to flinching. The song of skin, soon unsung. "
You Must Lift Your Son’s Languid Body,"off the couch, tuck him into whatever
soft breach of the covers he can needle
into. You must lift your own tired self
beyond the threshold of the door
and snuff each candle till the smoke
writes the hours into the quiet house.
Must lift each pillow from the day
where new dangers thrust their heads
up from the anchoring grass. Each living
rage beyond the break of the horizon,
past your sight even on this cloudless day.
Because the future drives on new tires—
because the plateau piles everything
you love back into dust. We drive our pick
through the mineral of our apprehensions
and put our loves to bed without stopping
ourselves. Without pausing despite our worn
trunks. Without stopping our breath of song."
Autism Screening Questionnaire: Social Interaction Difficulties,"1. Does your child have poor eye contact? Does he stare from unusual angles?
Yes. Like a dark bird from a high perch.
Yes. With acetylene torches lit somewhere in the distance.
With eyes wide as the Morpho’s iridescence.
Yes. Wild and hot like fixed stars.
2. Does your child not seem to listen when spoken to directly?
We call it dappled thoughts. He is constantly dappled—
here and not here. He is a thrush hidden in the sage.
3. Does your child have excessive fear of noises? Does he cover his ears frequently?
With wind there are moments—agonies. Like the time
we found him covering his ears in a cement sewer pipe
during a storm or when he fled into the street, shocked
by the vacuum. Often we hold him hard to keep the world
from flooding in. Often the world is sirens.
4. Does your child seem like he is in his own world?
We mourn him daily. And yet he guides me by the hand
through the threshold of his room as one guiding someone
just off a train, gently and lightly, avoiding the gap between
the platform and the track. The heat from his hand,
combustion-warm. Old stove in which we’ve heated this house.
5. Does he lack curiosity about his environment?
Because the color of the red door renders it mute.
Because the color of the die-cast car is an empty blue
and the sound of our voices could be any possible starling
we are not here. He is not here. And what of the place you reside
if you don't reside in it? Where then does your body blink?
6. Do his facial expressions not fit situations?
Nulled into a thick disquiet. Mouth agape.
Agate of the eye catches quick the inseam and
no blemish. No, no turning away and no smile.
The contraption shuts its winking gap.
7. Does he cry inappropriately? Does he laugh inappropriately?
A soothing so honed it does not surface
or salvage the daily losses. Which are also sharp
vibratos of hums along the jawbone—the music’s
arrowing shot into the thalamus. A strobe’s command
and call. A conspiratorial ache.
8. Does he have temper tantrums? Does he overreact when he doesn’t get his way?
He is a dark and stabled bull kicking at the chained gate.
9. Does he ignore pain? For example, when he bumps his head, does he react?
If it strikes you can’t rescind it. Juncture to
the brain. Sharp cortical hurt into which
leap charges—synapse to synapse, but then a what?
A question asks its question. A hurt insists and yet.
10. Does he dislike touch? Doesn’t want to be held?
There’s something about proximity. The dutiful
belonging of atoms and how we relate
the world through our skin. The exposed parts
of ourselves and how those pavilions are brushed by
a plum tree’s wicked thorns.
11. Does he hate crowds? Does he have difficulties in restaurants and supermarkets?
Everyday he’s praying through the meanwhiles.
The sequences of. Not just aflutter, but alone
he sits on the periphery. Ears beside his little body.
12. Is he inappropriately anxious? Scared?
To soothe, the sound of humming through teeth. And so
a symphony of fears. The ventricular outbursts pleat
the clouds. The sky is always exploding
and in that delirum, a curdled tone.
13. Does he speak the same to kids, adults, or objects?
Remind us of our asymmetries. Who is that again? And what
smile to let the darkness in? I see him speak to the man
in blue work clothes and the way his face yields to
the light. To the way moments like this explode.
14. Does he use language inappropriately? (Wrong words or phrases).
The world is a network of minds. Think
of the tongue and the fibers that make
its muscles. The branching capillary network
enmeshed. Alive and cooled with a song
that slides away. Tongue jammed in its stirrup
thinking of itself and the blood red
amanitas pushed out of the earth."
Pantoum Beginning and Ending with Thorns,"After Reena Saini Kallat’s “Woven Chronicle”
Because of the way a border on a map twists into thorns

Hum of the plane engine. Hum of idling car. Hum of the outboard motor.
Into travelogues and diaries. Into stories passed in the night,

The Lengths,"The chain link fence divorced two worlds           the dying St. Augustine under corpulent live oak                      the alley that paralleled Bonita Boulevard

where turbid rainwater puddled in potholes          the taste of sweat on our lips, oppressive air too thick to breathe

the alley alive with hundreds, maybe thousands of mosquitoes           I watched Jesús walk into the scourge
                    shirtless, eyes closed, arms outstretched

The unwonted lengths one will go to           to feel anything but the life they are given"
Your Biome Has Found You,"And who will kiss open
the spine of the resurrection fern
hunched like a widow, like a shamed child?
How it locks and hides and browns
under the sun—a laborer’s hands
picking blistered tomatoes
or a pile of bones, perhaps
bird bones—small, dry, silent.

Here is the damp and thickest marsh
of your interior wetland. And here,
your tundra of moss, rock, and shrub.
Here is the thing you lost,
perhaps the saddest or loveliest thing
—remember? It was suddenly taken—
as a fish spine is plucked from
its open body on an open plate.

You are helpless and wild here,
a murmuration of starlings in your chest.
Cicadas scream petrified from treetops.
The feral sounds of wilderness
sharpen your teeth.

It is November. Goldfish scales crunch
under your soles, the autumnal scent
of a fire inhales you, the aerials come and go.
Adding up all the dead things you carry,
you realize there is so much dirt in you.
Still, your nautilus ears listen, waiting
to hear your native sea."
Abuelo’s Garden,"Bendito, 
bendito, 
bendito sea Dios
los ángeles cantan y alaban a Dios

Memories of my grandfather’s garden come back to me 
differently than other child of the hood memories
Memories of my grandfather’s garden come back to me
in well water voices 
in deep chest hymns
that begin as a gurgle deep in the belly and rise to the throat
slowly
I remember little of the day my friends jumped me in
I remember fists flailing and afterwards 
those deep, fleshy embraces 
only Latinos know how to give
but grandfather’s garden comes back to me with aromas, with tastes
with corridos sung to the sun
and novenas sung to the moon
thanking both sides of life 
the light and the dark
for their bountiful harvests
Ay, Dios mio,
all those nights we knelt together in brown earth
it was always about harmony, about balance
He’d intone deeply thanking the life-giving soil for its gift
and I’d follow suit
carefully pulling up cilantro, manzanilla, yerba del manso
always making sure metal spade never touches fragile root
sweet, ancient Abuelito, 
how could I be anything but a poet after those moments we shared
Don’t you see,
In my grandfather’s garden 
chiles grew
In my grandfather’s garden 
children grew
In my grandfather’s garden 
poems rose from the earth
like the twisted arms of la llorona desperately reaching out 
for her missing children
In my grandfather’s garden all of these things grew
slowly
because beautiful things take time to bloom
In my grandfather’s garden all of these things would rise 
slowly
like well water voices 
like deep chest hymns 
that begin as a gurgle deep in the belly and rise to the throat 
slowly singing
always singing

Bendito, 
bendito, 
bendito sea Dios
los ángeles cantan y alaban a Dios
los ángeles cantan y alaban a Dios

"Louis Armstrong Plays for His Wife in Giza, 1961","The sphinx is not drowsy.
Its ear heavy with brass
that echoes off its half-broken face.
The sphinx thinks this is its coronation
that this must be the final blast
written in the books of old.
It now wishes to rise
from this stony couch,
but Louis said he’d play for her anywhere.
He played for her in front of the sphinx
in the shadow of a pyramid, sweat
trickling down his bow-tied body.
This is what the poet says:
Forget the sphinx and its riddles
this is what love sounds like in Giza.
this is what man will do to please her."
Leaves Like Prayer,"This is what leaves like a prayer: 
the collard greens my father planted.

A collard is a cabbage that does not develop a heart.
Their green leaves are like hands 
about to clasp in solemn devotion, 
arching towards the sun for a blessing.

My father sleeps in his grave.

And the collard greens he planted 
keep growing in his autumn garden.
The frost sweetens them
and the time comes to reap what dead
hands have sown. My brother cuts 
the green hands from the earth’s body.
the green prayers do not leave the black earth.

But here we are. At the table with turkey
and stuffing. Clasping our hands over 
his greens drenched in hamhock juice. 

We eat prayers. 

This we do in remembrance of him.
Take. Eat. His love
grown for you and me."
I ask about what falls away,"I ask about what falls away.
I ask about where water sings.  
Here is surplus of sun, ocean  
of excess, remaindered song.  
Whose hands wash this sky?  
Who drains this sun against worry?  
Whose mighty ache makes history?  
This is where water drains,  
where gardens grow against  
worry, against the crisis of capital,  
& capital knows nothing but the  
veil hiding hand from profit. Here  
is leftover rice. & the wild imaginary  
of hunger. Here is a canal in  
the crook of the earth. & here is  
where water sings. & this, this  
is water singing us elsewhere. "
Dear Kasama,"I draft this, dear kasama, against  
fish-hooks of hope. I draft against  
slow elimination. I draft from soft 
interior of riot. I draft syllables of  
known sadness, such knowing, 
such evidence, such kitchen table  
phenomenology of you reading this,  
of this reading you—on a rainy 
& black hoodie delivering bags  
of groceries at the doorstep. I draft  
from collected stillness, restless ghosts 
archived in my veins. Consider this  
an intimate poetics of rage. Consider  
this rage divine refusal. Let us talk  
about such refusal. Let us talk about  
such dysregulation of promise. Let  
us talk about how much I miss you. "
Chain Migration II: On Negations and Substitutions,"Not the tamarind. But instead
lemon, though sometimes lime.
Not nipa mats on floors for beds
but rather frames that chime
when running hands through oak spindles.
Never your thickest coat
for winter. Parkas, a must! Kin
sends discards, clothes to float
you through the season. No soy sauce?
No problem! Worcestershire
salts the tongue in equivalence.
No coconut vinegar?
Sometimes white will do. Its sour
flavor pushes us through
the recipe. Sometimes it’s our
expectations we screw
into a tighter face. Sometimes
what home is…isn’t that.
Adjust the thermostat to nine
degrees past. Habitats
don’t bend to our aftermaths. No.
There are, instead, some swaps—
a roof over our heads. And now?
A self to lose? A trap?
The gamble of the recipe
is salt and sweat, the wrong
of it. The parts necessitate
a flavor test. Too strong?
Then let’s behave, hide our features—
distrust the place and stare
long into the TV’s ether.
Lose words into the air. "
An Image of The Book In Which I Hear You,"If there is standing water in the desert. If there is water and I am standing
over it. Staring down into the murk
or mirror of the pool.
If I am breathing. If I can see myself in the oasis.
If I am speaking and there is water
and you are there.
If you are also speaking. If we can hear across
the water, our voices
carrying in opposite directions,
our voices carrying. If our languages unspool in blue drifts
against the distance, escaping reticence.
If the distance of our reticence
is false. If it isn’t crossable.
If we cross it anyway.
Who will carry us? If our narratives erase us.
If our histories return to us
as names, and we are living
in the error of our alphabets. If the center of the letters
hurt. Master, Stranger. What is water,
where is water safe
if solitude displaces us? If we are homeless, finally,
each of us. If we wander past
each other, our faces moored
to their reflections,
the edges wrecked. Is it imaginary?
If the images we make
remake us. If there is mercy
in us. If our speaking
changes, and we, ourselves,
are changing, making. If we are made
in the image of the other. In ambiguity and contradiction.
If we consent
to not be solitary. If we imagine we are somewhere.
If there is shore"
Grove of Meaning,"In the middle of September, after everything
we loved had ended, the day remained
a sound pronounced among
emergencies. It was almost
beautiful. A scrawl of voices shook an opposition
through the trees and I believed them.
What is not forgiveable?
Among the black metallic structure
of my language, imperfect
in the present tense, I called to you
across the open grove
and listened. Terror-struck and tethered
to each other, we lived and breathed and were surrounded
by our speaking. The leaves descended
like the inconsistent weather of the law. Our voices
carried them. Ungoverernable, the sun, the sun, the sun"
Of Genesis,"The origin of every book is loss.
There is not a word
in the beginning
and language always listens
to its end. Tell me
what has left its mark
upon the names you give to stars
you cannot see
and I will try to break the sentence
into something
strange enough to trust.
Look, the world is blue as death
down here already. The air is poisoned
by our breath. It is getting difficult to teach our children
how to speak by speaking"
"Dear David,","When I write to you now I write
to one who has left the here for
the beyond. That’s the future, as you know
better than anyone. In the past, that rainbow
zigged across your face, your eyebrows absent
and so your eyes in their sockets went
unsheltered, direct and uncanny. I can remember
myself most clearly when I remember
how unnerving, how the gaze from behind the paint
loosened the strength of what I thought I knew.
All collapsed now, total blam blam.
Each new face effacing the last, a kind
of courage, I think now, an offering and
a refusal at the same time. And why would you
regret any of it? The trick was to give it away,
but not all of it, the unspent light drawing us
to you, to what you sang, with a gravitational pull.
Whatever that secret was, it keeps telling itself.

Ode,"The white horses by the lake lift their heads
to see whose feet make a plodding tattoo
on the road: mine, dear white horses:
I’m advancing a hypothesis that I can run,
even as my years advance, adding
evidence to the brief against
my ineluctable decline.
White horses, gleaming across the damp,
across riparian grasses and untidy trees—
dear pearl of the sky, with belled canopy
and sheen, I stop to take a photograph
of the horses, using the rule of thirds to frame it—
more a rule of quarters, to capture more sky—
I love you more even than white horses
in the rain, constant but not somehow
insistent, beading my hair and needling
my shirt. Birds in transit, if these were my waters,
I could name you; still, I watch you move
from ground to sky, the cloudy corridors
and vestibules for your traverse, and
watching you, for once the world feels
reasonable, knit of many skeins but
of similar weights, as you purl
the cumulonimbus, drawing the sky
nearer, though only when I half-say it,
turning an idea of the unreachable
familiar. Your gray bellies mirror the crowns
of the oaks and alder, and in your unseen
fingers combing the leaves, I see
that you too are stirred by something
invisible, the only evidence being that drift,
like the little breath of cold air that seeps in
around the edges of an old window:
the soft inhalation of a mover, I think,
for no reason except I like it, a name
for that breath other than equations
someone has devised to describe it,
dear space I hold open against all evidence:
the ones who have passed before me
are nowhere to be seen, I hear no trace
of their speech, no matter how I figure
what is above me: trees not yet aflame,
your blossom just finished, I won’t
be here in autumn when the cold
will set color in your leaves, fire
that burns but does not consume:
and thus I won’t hear draw not nigh hither,
put off thy shoes, though I am always
prepared for a thing to be holy."
Students,"translated from the Italian by Will Schutt.
I run into them in squares 
or coffee shops, most of the time 
I recognize them, and marvel at 
what they’ve become:
all those eyes and fingers.
Wrenches, suits. Some shy, 
others obnoxious. And the burnouts, 
the ones who lick the dirt.
Then there’s me,
carrying cucumbers and a roll of TP.
    Allievi 
Li incontro sulle piazze 
o in qualche bar, li riconosco 
quasi sempre, e penso cosa diventano, 
adesso, tutti quegli occhi, quelle dita.
Carburatori, cravatte. Certi timidi, 
altri perfino odiosi. E i devastati, 
quelli che leccano l’asfalto.
E infine anch’io
che ho in mano cetrioli e carta igienica."
Sleep Hygiene,"A bed should be a tender slab, devoid of insects.
A tired woman should be able to lie across diagonally,
headache to hag feet.
A bed should exist in crystalline silence.
It should have a sleepy blue view.
A nearby window not close to voyeurs.
A bed should have a special pillow to shush the head,
to coddle and safety the amygdala.
If established on the ground, a bed should have
a bioluminescent quilt to redirect the gaze: the prey
is over there.
If established in a tree, the quilt may allow for free feet
or a tossback with luxuriant abandon.
Among other things, do not build your bed on dictionaries
or books of any kind.
A bed is best made from a wood frame, or metal, or dark matter.
A bed should be free of lye, lime, and liars.
One should be able to enter the bed and think
I could fly far away in this. I could die; I could just die."
Oregon State Hospital,"Roberto Cabrera performs his Protactile poem “Oregon State Hospital”
translated from the Protactile by John Lee Clark
Wandering in the museum
I came across a woman’s story.
Let us conjure her up
in the form of a fist.
First, they knocked her head
and they said, Tsk-tsk.
Next, they zapped her
and they said, Huh.
Next, they shone lights in her face
and they said, Phooey.
Finally, they bored a hole here
and another here.
Her head tilted gently to the side
and they said, Aha."
Stability Is a Feeling,"a found poem: The Unabridged Journals of Sylvia Plath
I am doing nothing with my exile
of a life.
I go to the supermarket Saturday
on walks in the wilderness
of America on Sunday. I get thin.
I encourage the man I married
to work hard
at a career I don’t admire.
He is not sweet or funny.
He is as steady and strong as death.
I find myself horrified
of the future; the woman I want to be
is implausible. Voicing
my tender ideas is not possible.
The book of poems inside me
is desperate for morning."
Heretic,"When you sang your body invented us
     an alphabet. No one heard it
          but me.
The earth in your eyes
     is the ink in your words.
          Each look writes another line.
Everything I need to know grows wings
     and lands on my skin.
          A thousand tiny plovers
cover the skies, and shine
     like moonlight on us both,
          turning us into your verses.
Last night each dot and curve of the letters of our alphabet
     came to rest on my body while I slept,
          entwined around my hips,
pulled their fingers through my hair.
     I breathed them in. Became the song
          you sang me.
You spell the morning prayer
     uttered by my lips.
          Syntax of attention
at the back of your throat. Each rise in note
     is your hand on my ribs.
          You hold me and no one can see.
Our unholy wholeness hides.
          Your name in the nearness. Says listen.
                    Sentences of rebellion
in the starless night."
Winter of Tumult and Artifact,"Again I navigate to the throat of the ocean for audible 
guidance and to acquire primitive details from the fraught 
plummet and slender horizon: a chain link, a stained
Bible. I make peace with the innocent wielding. At the edge— 
a teaspoon, a sandal. A shearwater circles without anger
and lightens, its wide wings, imperial, spread over
the repetition of distance. The wind leaves its motion
in filigreed sand, while out at the midpoint, an elliptical 
brooding. The water is full of itself and going nowhere
every twelve hours, and I might be the only one
to believe it or to be frightened. It commingles its salt
with lost objects and spits out a metal button, the hook
of an earring. The holy knife of water slices
further. Not that this could be simplified to the in-
out of action, the efficient carving of portions. Not
that anything is all farewell and return. Or all hunger.
Every time I capture a hollow bleached bone, a yawning 
plastic bag, another token, who says there is focus?
The grim light splashes up on me daily as I find
the remnants of strangers—a small tin, a key
still almost magenta. So it is pure reason to tend the endless 
wealth given by a thousand angles of light as water
dances the riptide. Every day an epiphany of loosening 
tedium. Out of the ocean’s sleek windows,
every vulnerable object seems to surrender. What I clutch
is only a resemblance of yesterday’s losses claimed
by the ocean’s euphoria, now docked in the slack at the shore. 
The cold is still luminous and preening. In the end,
there is no end if you stand long enough beside it."
From “Sister Tongue”,"Noosh-e joon. 
I tell the chef of the house how delicious her food is, and she says back, Noosh-e joon. A blessing that goes deep—a giving back of more than just the meal. 
Noosh-e joon. I say it now. Sometimes I just say it in my head, because I know the person eating my food doesn’t know what it means. But I mean it. It comes without me ever learning it literally. It comes from wanting to keep the gratitude in the open, not shy. 
I want to explain: 
It has little to do with, So kind of you to say. It’s close to, You’ve tasted my love and given it back to me. I give it back again. I deposit it deep inside you. I knew all that before I ever had to ask. I even knew it when I pronounced it wrong, said, moosh, a word for cute, because I could tell how sweet it sounded. I learned it before I learned it. When I say it now, I want to say it raw, I don’t want to stop myself, even though I often do. I am intimate. I want to sound like all my aunts who ever said it to me: Hear my love in your ears, swallow it.

Like the Wolf,"Deployment Day 220
Most days are rice and radish,
the roiling of bones in a slick broth.
They are matchsticked carrot,
picked cilantro, the clean
blade of new onion.
Those days are lamb,
and piglet, the sleeping 
nose of spring suckling 
in new green. They are days 
when I fall asleep 
warm in our bed,
as the season thunders
softly to itself.
Others are nothing
but hunger, and the world 
becomes a tufted ear, 
a sprouted fang,
a desire to devour
children, grandmothers,
a huntsman whole.
Without the bone, there is no
soup. Without the soup,
only the gnaw of you
one ocean, another continent
away, and not answering
the phone. It is the held
breath, the way I must not
huff it out, instead howl
solemnly in the empty
night. When the skin comes
crawling off me—in a dark
bar, on a back porch,
tucked deep in white down—
I don't know how to fill
what teethes inside.
To be made of something
as cold as stone.
It's okay. I'm beginning
to learn that what I cannot 
blow down
will still burn."
Skins and Bones,"Deployment Day 150
Halfway through October and I have lost
hope of autumn, everything still the green
green green it was when you left. 
I wonder if this will be another year
of wind and banshee flame as I wait
for rain in the endless blue. I want to say
I can bear this, but I wear your absence
in my face, in the way my skin crawls off
in the night when you’re asleep in a cold
country, dreaming no doubt of something
warm. Here our cat stopped eating 
six days ago, her haunches peaked
and sharp on my lap, where she circles
herself to sleep. Each time I wonder
if she’ll wake. But she is as warm 
as this month, and soon she thrums
against my thigh. We are saying a sort
of goodbye each day, when she looks 
at me and I am all the heartbreak 
a body can hold. We say skin and bones
but nothing of how big the eyes become, 
how wonder and starvation are twin. 
I try to call you to say this. There is nothing 
but the trilling ring that calls out 
like a bird that forgot its season."
I Buy My Monster Roses,"Though the people on the internet help too. 
They send money by pressing a small button 
on their screens. It would be disingenuous 
to claim all the credit—we can’t heal
or hurt alone. I sniff the tops of the rose heads 
like a newborn’s scalp—fresh skin and hair
only a few days picked. I try to arrange the flowers
on my bed, create a romantic scene 
like all the 90s rom-coms I still watch. I’m stuck
in the past, I know. I’m stuck in the present, 
I know that too. I thought the roses 
could be a cure, and maybe in a small way
they were, each petal I plucked so gently 
from the stems gave in to me. "
We Never Stop Talking About Our Mothers,"Renee and I, hers—in the urn by her desk 
and mine—alive in an apartment forty minutes 
from here, probably watching a telenovela, frying 
plantains, texting me goodnight. Renee’s mother isn’t
really in the urn. She’s in the blue wall, 
the beach landscape painting, the dog 
barking at the unexpected, the jangle of silver bracelets. 
We are all carrying our mothers, and we are all better 
daughters with the dead. She tells me I am wise, 
and all I can think about are the moments of my unwiseness: driving 
and sipping margaritas from a water bottle, the bruise 
on my arm and taking him back. Her husband 
is away at the family cabin, and she is glad 
for the space. My husband doesn’t exist, and I am 
sad for the space I make my home in. I buy sunflowers 
and goat cheese, throw a dinner party for the ghosts. 
I don’t know Renee’s mother’s name to send a proper invitation.
I don’t know the names of the women in my family 
past my great grandmother. How will I call upon them
when it’s time? Will I call them Mary or Venus 
or Yemaya? I’ve yet to burn the palo santo, the sage. 
I want to leave behind a legacy of light. 
I want to leave someone better. "
Unspooled,"Sometimes I feel as if I’m undone, 
a big spool of yarn 
rolling down a steep hill and out into the street,
down the garbage-gathered drain. 
Other times, I’m standing in front of Ramon’s
apartment building in Mexico City. Remember
when I broke that bottle of Tequila Herradura.
It shattered in shards and slivers. 
¡Hijole, y fue uno de los Buenos! 
the doorman lamented, watching the smooth 
white liquid spill onto the sidewalk. Lost. 
I wonder what people would say about me 
as I fall and crash to smithereens. 
I want to laugh out loud when I see 
I’m as solid as a snow cone. 
As if I could be slurped up, tossed out or simply melt away.
As if I could be a sweetness craved, a crying child’s prize
on steaming summer days. 
Prescription: Wrap arms tightly 
around chest, imagine freshly baked challah, 
imagine a Friday night when you allow 
yourself to rest your shredded senses, 
and put on that white lace Brazilian dress. 
Do not think of shards, 
think instead of strong vigas, high 
ceilings, an unobstructed view 
of the Big Dipper, Leonard Cohen 
carrying your darkness in his secret chords. 
Sing Hallelujah. 
Sing Heneni 
I am here."
Love Letter to a Burning World,"Southern California 2020
Praise the dark that covers us with ashes, 
this morning’s tears, reminding us why we cherish
the not-burning baby cry of awake, not heartbreak. 

Mom, I need a hug, please, 
I just can’t seem to do anything right. 
Raphael, the angel name, should we have birthed
a warrior instead, one who could fight the demons? 

I can’t say for sure I’m an addict but I’m doing too much.
He gets up, then decides he’d rather smoke, 
not feeling OK right now. 
I am twisted up, feel the same way. Not OK. 

No, son, what you are feeling are singed embers
after six months of shutdown. Broken glass. 
Murder after murder of men and women the color of your skin.
At traffic stops, in the dark, in bed, while jogging. Anywhere. 

Praise the path that brought you here today, a boomerang.
Mom, I can’t make it, I’m at the car repair, I need
to keep looking for someone who can fix this. 
The drop like we hear in music, I hear it in his soul. 

My face is wet as he leaves in a gust: 
I have to meet my friends at the demonstration, I’ll feel better.
More purpose. Do you kill a child by holding or letting go?
Ashes, ashes as he runs out the door. 

Doesn’t he know this is an emergency? 
Like the blare of fire warning, 
Pack your bags comes from the evacuation order.  

Today his voice searing into my chest. 
Praise his tears for crying with me. 
Praise the seat that holds me fast. "
Return of the Woolly Mammoth,"You rarely wore it,
though you yourself chose the color, midnight blue,
and knee-length cut. In derision you named it 
“the woolly mammoth,” pointing to its Pleistocene proportions.
Still at each sign of snow, I nagged you to wear it. 
The last time I saw you
you confessed you’d have to give it away.
“Not one more winter,” you swore.
Yet when you chose it once more,
were you thinking of me?
Last of its species, the mammoth was hunted 
to extinction.
In a different Ice Age, it took you down
under the cold waters
of the dam, and sure enough, kept you down,
sodden, for a month,
until you surfaced, found.
I like to think of you buttoned up,
and until the last
breaths, beats, 
its boxy bulk somehow
kept you unaware,
insulated from creeping cold discovery."
It Was Enough,"After the autopsy, 
the plan was a simple transfer
from that table to the funeral parlor.
But I wanted you home,  
a place you couldn’t seem to reach.
You were just here for the holidays,
but you’d been gone so long.
So the station wagon fire-red hearse
parked under the basketball court,
where you once played endless NBA games,
you chalking, me cheating 
the stations of Around the World.
Now you stay put. 
The winter light plays out 
under the driveway’s broken maple boughs
while I go over with the undertaker 
Mass card designs, casket models, prayer order.
Every time I stepped outside to say
hello and goodbye,
all I saw of the back seat
was your tautened feet
and thin legs, too thin, 
up to about your bony knees,
up to where the opaque windows hid you.
(Stretched straight, hardened like Christ’s
after the cross, I thought.)
All I would ever more see of you,
naked, swaddled 
in the plush magenta funeral blanket."

there wasn’t anybody on tv who looked like her—she had to
go hunting for scraps. it’s appreciation. not that we would know that.

Snow Globe of Denver,"where disabled activists lived and loved

Marie Bashkirtseff Said,"Marie Bashkirtseff said
(From some dim place she said),
So many years I have been dead
To this dull world, and still,
Good folks are saying with a will,
“Surely, surely Marie was past praying for.”
Or,
“She was wilful, she was wild,
Half a savage, half a child.”
“In such a year,” they say,
“She threw all decency away,
So and so, thus and thus;
Credulous and mutinous,
Calamitous and amorous,
Were the things she gloried in.”
All their humour turned to gall,
One and all
On my reputation fall,
And smack their lips on storied sin.
“Farrago!
Snobbish and selfish farrago!""
That is their name for thee,
Beloved diary!
Come, let us make enquiry,
Is that all these Philistines can know?
Then let the true and tragic tale begin,
Of that and this,
Right well I wis,
None ever heard
These say a word. 
Of this, the horror that I knew,
The serpent grief that coiled and threw
Its small, glittering eyes on me,
Green and snaky eyes that held
All my will, and me compelled
To the numbing misery
Of some fascinated bird—
Of all this,
Well I wis—
Never a word! 
Of this the hooded snake that drew
And watched me circle round and round,
Of how I fluttered, fell, and flew
Frantic spaces from the ground;
Of the singing in my ears,
Hideous clamour, mocking jeers,
Of the devastating fears,
Dear and familiar things unheard,
Of the awful hope deferred—
Oh, well I wis
Of all this—
Never a word! 
Of the hidden, dull despair,
Of the grievous lassitude,
Of the crowning horror where
Blossomed love and plenitude;
Of the odious, choking shame,
Dissimulation, anger, blame,
Embarrassment, I overcame,
Of ridicule, mistakes absurd,
Of all this,
Well I wis—
Not a word! 
Of all the anguish borne in secret,
Loss of trust in God and Man,
Of the great ambition shattered,
Budding hope and darling plan;
Of the soundless wind and rain
Beating on the window-pane;
Of the untruths told in vain;
Of the voiceless bird and beast,
Of the songless, laughless feast,
Of the mind to madness spurred,
Never a word! 
Of life’s last keen extremity,
Fear of laughter, fear of pity,
Of the death that would not smite,
Of my heart pierced—uncontrite,
Living, thrilling, mad-to-live,
Quick, ceremented, splenitive,
Broken heart!
Of my youth so over-yeared,
Of all this,
Too well I wis,
Not a word—
Ah! Never a word. "
Praise Dave,"For David Drake, 
Enslaved potter from Edgefield, SC  
First time I see a jar rise up, 
I be midwifed into life. 
Understood how these pots and I be
kin—dismissed to what’s under foot.  
I learned to turn and turn—
people the world with pots. 
I pour my need into the knead 
until forty thousand around me crowd, 
but everything I love, I lose 
so I want what I mold to hold. 
Even my empty pots 
be full. One say: 
I wonder where is all my relations 
Friendship to all—and every nation. 
There are lanterns in my words— 
every story got another story. 
Some call me Dave the slave, if that’s all they got,
I say leave the rhymes to me.  
When people look at me, a slave be 
the first excuse they use not to see me. 
I say praise me. It won’t fall on deaf ears.
I catch praise like most people catch
naps.  
I am a 6-foot vessel of anything, but 
ordinary a one of a kind with a Carolina
shine.  
I stepped out of the rows of cotton 
to master the potter’s wheel. 
I take the wind out of can’t. 
with my mark, I make a mark. 
I sign my name Dave. 
I don’t write slave.
See if my pots and I spin history. 
See if we hold hold hold…"
"Across the Victorious Scrub Brush, Crow Spirals","shake the sky while I walk back for hours 
in a particular emptiness, air hoarse, fitting
to its broad-shouldered detours. The land magnets
to rises and I move toward the high language of tree in a starved
arroyo, a big cottonwood that I once saw twitch
with an owl, voluptuous, who dawdled until I was directly under
pillar and leaf, then repeated its wings and was off 
with a vision of other fault planes,
pulses. When I come out here, I give up
all the fictions of the nation. I can taste evidence of silence
and hold my thought. Just me and an unruffled
verdigris loneliness, which is maybe the comfort I’ve best lived with
as normal. Where the desert bakes its stones
to old oaths, it is easy to count all the conclusions
as seduction. Right-sized, half-forward. Coming here
means I can see if the tree is blue with raking shadow, star limbs
and leaf-taking today. Means landing. Dreaming. 
I don’t know if this is proof
of mortality. But I’m whistling. The end is always near but every future 
has been forgotten. I was a happy girl. I remember so little."
Oak Skin,"Every wood I’ve stepped into
has a watchful crone, a witch whose skin
resembles the bark of an ancient oak.
She spins her wool by moonlight,
she threads her fingers through the moss,
and knows exactly which mushrooms to pick.
I don’t need my hearing to feel the changes
in the wind when she slips out of the gaps
between the rocks and the trees, her voice
I feel in the roots I step on, in the stones
I try to avoid with my bare feet that always
manage to bruise me, test the calluses I’ve grown
with each stride I’ve taken through these trees.
I’ve sung to her beneath the arms of the beeches
reaching towards the birches, though she never
listens to me. I imagine she laughs at the tune
I cannot keep, before moving on, gathering weeds
by the stars, mixing potions to use on people
like me, who would walk into her arms gladly,
wishing she were an old aunt I could visit to learn
everything about this world she keeps to herself."
I'm Fly,"For Clayton “Peg Leg” Bates 
Some people got two good feet  
and still don’t know what to do.  
My smoothness makes the argument 
for just one. My other leg be long gone  
sacrificed to the cotton gin god.  
They pinned my mangled mess down 
to the kitchen table. Made me suffer more 
under the hand of an unsterilized knife  
with only a cotton bit to bare the pain.  
I got up and spit out that terrible taste  
of Jim Crow and pity. Spun my mama’s guilt  
and worry into a dance that twists past  
the neighbors’ prayer, gossip and stares  
of how he gonna make do with just one leg?  
I strap on my dreams with tux, tails and flair.  
Turn can’t into can without losing time  
not even in my mind. This Fountain Inn son  
done good, I knock beats on wood.  
I’m a worldwide showstopper all right. 
Shout rings around all those two-footers.  
I’m the master of my own fate,  
when the world cut me at the thigh 
I don’t shuffle off in misery,  
I get up on my one good leg and fly."
Make No Apologies For Yourself,"Dear You,
Make no apologies for yourself
Because you are covered in a listening skin
Because every ache you feel is not your own
Because of the lynching tree
Because of how many rivers they crossed
Because of the bowl of sorrow your mother carries
Because of your father’s wildfire moods
Because when you enter bookstores
books fall off of shelves into your open palms
Because you ask questions of the universe
the world opens before you like a page
Because of those clouds, and that murder of crows
Because poets are your wounded idols
Because the truth even if it hurts, it is to be cherished and held
and just because people die
does not mean they don’t walk with you daily
Because the river has a mouth that speaks their names
Because the river flows with stories
Because you sit on the shore and listen
Because alone is more comforting than being together
Because your pen is oceanic
Because you are big-eyed and eyes wide
Because you suffer from what you see and hear
Because you have sinus arrhythmia
You know your heart is linked to your breath
and your breath is short,
Because asthma is one of the monkeys on your back
Because your heart is the vehicle you chose to ride this go round
Because it can go forward and backwards in time
Because bookstores have always been oracles
Because poetry is your greatest archeological tool
Because you dig and you dive
Because you plummet if you cannot swim
Because you trust the ride of journal and journey
even if you do not always float
Because your heart beats to your breath
Because of this music, you dance raw and wild"
Into This Absence,"What is available to us?
Simple routines: fault and moments. 

Between building and building, dark fogs
drizzle. The world is enormous. Unfathomable salt. 

A slug on the path posits its feelers to figure which way
to turn. Some slow work to go forward. 

Agnes Martin teetered and retreated. 

I’m tracking down less.
The line resting right there. 

Again and again. And below it.
After talking death with a friend all morning, what I need

that runs through the hiatus, the measured task 

the mind makes to move off either side. "
The Music of Beauty,"To me thy lips are mute, but when I gaze
Upon thee in thy perfect loveliness,—
No trait that should not be—no lineament
To jar with the exquisite harmony
Of Beauty’s music, breathing to the eyes,
I pity those who think they pity me;
Who drink the tide that gushes from thy lips
Unconscious of its sweets, as if they were
E’en as I am—and turn their marble eyes
Upon thy loveliness, without the thrill
That maddens me with joy’s delirium."
Necromancy for the Bitter,"I planted a coast live oak seedling
in the front yard today,
not with my own vestigial hands, 
but through the sentinel, pallbearing palms
of an able-bodied surrogate.
I can see it now, six inches tall and
stolid against the gentle breeze—
a pittance of cupped, spiny-toothed
leaves dangling from a stem curved in
proud contrast to my corrected scoliosis.
Long after my ventilator is sent to palliate
another among the unfortunate dying
and my lungs are but dust
on a slagged pair of Harrington rods,
the little oak might be a three-foot whip,
battered but not broken by the ephemeral desert breath
that creeps over mountains named by the Spanish for
some saint that never kept their end of the deal.
If drought holds off for a year or three
and my oak escapes the quirks of fate,
one day it might spread and thrive
until its carpet of jagged leaves bloody
the bare feet of a child or passing Pomeranian
and I live again through their pain."

 "
If Being a Man Allowed for Emotion,"...it would be like hearing the grass grow 
or the squirrel’s heartbeat, and we should die of that roar 
which is the other side of silence  —George Eliot
My mourning is quiet, stealthy like the pause 
before bad news. An inherited trait near as I can
tell. All the men in my line are instinctually stoic & 
hidden—brackish bodies, damned at the gates. 
My last uncle just passed away, also of cancer, 
and with my brother Tyrone I discuss this too as inheritance— 
annual X-rays to hunt what would prey on us.
Memories surface of fishing trips
and nickel poker, except my grief has substituted
his face for Tyrone’s and dad’s for mine. 
What am I if not mane,
if not king,
     if not crown & control
& grass-shadow-eyes hidden?
My son’s first time sinking a hook in ocean water 
was with him just a few months ago and we split 
a can of High Life and hovered over the entrails 
of a sausage sandwich and laughed
at everything and he was the last of his brothers 
and the closest thing to seeing dad again—I breathe 
deep and slow like a big cat when blood is in the air
or ground, drop the phone on the bathroom floor,
slide down the wall against the shower door
like an avalanche crashing down a glass mountain,
head cupped in open palms & become a prayer 
built on bad knees, become swinging
jaw—unhinged, become throttle & throat &
roar,
            remembering my pride."
Like Prophets of Baal,"We had gotten a whole hog
from Aulander, pink-fleshed
and splayed like a sacrifice
to cover sin, which is belief 
that tomorrow is a place 
we can eat.
I walk around the offering 
before the body is pulled.
The men maneuver flame
and smoke seems to follow me
no matter where I go. Dad is gone
to tend the fire.
My uncle motions the bag toward me,
peels it from the bottle’s mouth like 
a fast-moving rain cloud. It burns sweet
on my finger. I look around nervous [the way 
            I would years later when the homeless man 
            outside 7-Eleven returned with Mad Dog, OE,
            and something for himself].
That’s good stuff, my uncle says, and I nod
in belief, face contorting into an amen.
But it burns. It burns
like the split-open swine on cinder-block.
See! How the smoke follows our gods
like eyes of a portrait, an heirloom.
The men walk in their own ritual
of pretense, ignoring whole conflagrations.
My uncle ignores hole burns in his chest. 
Just like Dad. [One day I’d beg Uncle Skin
            to put the cigarettes down.
            He’d say there’s no point in quitting now 
            when he could feel what was chasing him 
            already had hold.]
Temple of blackened-breathing, charred
flesh, his lung is smoking in the pit,
it’s right there, leapt from his torso. 
We hop out his truck and the brown paper
cloud disappears under his seat, crackling
its own thunder.
He shows me how to coerce
embers back into flame while 
he lights a Newport. Done:
the tradition handed down.
            [Decades pass and I still drink cognac, 
            my throat an altar of wet ground, each sip 
            proof, each taste a howl for resurrection. 
            Bring it back, that moon, bring it back, his smile 
            an introduction, a soft mischief.
            I don’t even think Dad would’ve minded
            the Hennessy really, but I never told him.
            Most beliefs we build on secrets.
            When I say cancer runs
            in my family, what I mean is
            my father and his five siblings 
            couldn’t run fast enough.
            What I mean is I ain’t been back 
            to my hometown since this uncle’s 
            funeral. What I mean is 
            Dad is gone. My uncle followed 
            like smoke. I’m being chased.
            A monster’s hot breath 
            searches for my lungs.]
I get down face-to-gnarled-face 
with the animal whose skin pops.
I can smell the pork 
ripen like impending rain 
on the summer air.
I summon the fire now. 
Swallow it. Like the men & gods before me
            [I stretch a rod through billowing 
            smoke to touch, to test, to measure 
            a prophecy against an unforgiving sky]."
Douglass Pool,"Pulling my left shin
into my chest. Like this. 
I wonder if this lifeguard 
thinks I’m a freak. In water 
limbs are even more 
like antennas. The first thing 
I do

To prove to myself 
that the body can. Be completely 
surrounded. 
Remembering water
is like remembering your 
iridescent thighs. In this instance 
you is just another pronoun. Like 
when she said you can go through 
the woman’s side. As if to say
you and your body 
are not a threat to women. Or
the sex of your aide will determine 
your species. Though in water
I push in all the regular ways.
She says I’m not allowed to wear
my purple shirt. White shirts only. 
So I imagine myself completely

the perimeter of my reflection.

Identity Voodoo,"A body possessed by identity voodoo

timescape of rumpus,

hunt to the strangest of death,
do not educate,
do not write literary words
that ruminate power
The essays of a learned Dark man are
wings of pain that fly,
light words cannot entertain them—
flammable and curious
enough to rupture the pregnancy of prejudice
Oh solidarity!
We are an anthology of Brown leaves
We are the pillars of an uncommon dream
We are a collectionnnnn of lit trends and sounds
We are the promised prayer of a future
where Dark sons are not lesser,
where death by geography is unknown,
where solidarity is like a magnet
strengthening the people
grieving again and again and again
for the Dark bones deceased by death

We are a body

Neh Tsoi,"At the age of a hundred and ten

Elder Prophet asked his question,
the Mayan night breathing deep around
the small Yucatan town of Naha
as we sat by his fire.
Young ones, what will you dream this night?
Neh tsoi, he said, neh tsoi, it is good.
Which moved first, your feet or the dance?
And what is it that your heartbeat answers?
The throb of the tide? The drum of thunder?
Neh tsoi, neh tsoi, he said again.
Can your metal watch tell us the time
as well as the ancient cycles of Sun,
stone calendars sown by the seasons?
Young ones, what will you dream this night?"

A Prayer in Signs,"No uttered word is ours—no solemn tone
   The reverent air bears upward to the sky:
No eloquence of meaning, borne along
   Of voice and accent, meet the God on high.
But dare ye tell us that we do not pray—
   We who so truly “lift up hands of prayer,”
And by the speaking gesture mark the way,
   Our heart’s desire would take to reach Him there?
“Our Father!” that appealing gesture lifts.
   With force more potent than the spoken word,
Desire, petition for the precious gift
   Held in the hand of One All-Seeing Lord.
“In Heaven!” we picture in the circling sweep
   Of arm and hand, the glorious dome above;
“Holy Thy Name!” with reverent movement keep
   The sacred thought of purity and love.
“Thy Kingdom!” with imperial touch we show.
   The badge of royalty—the sceptre’s sway;
And that Thy glorious Will may work and grow
   Potent and perfect, this and every day.
Our opened hands with daily bread to fill
   The Lord we ask, “Forgive as we forgive”:
O hearing brothers! We are like you still—
   The hardest this to pray, and this to live.
From tempter’s touch, whene’er beside he stands—
   We pray Thee still our weakness to defend:
And by the symbol strong of broken bands
   We crave deliverance, succor, to the end.
Once more the royal sign—“Thy Kingdom Thine!”
   “The Power,” that sign is vital, living, strong:
“The Glory”: rays of brightness seem to shine
   And scintillate around us, sweet and long.
“Forever and forever!” round and round
   The finger sweeps, and who shall tell us then
Expression for the prayer we have not found,
   Nor join us in our glad and grand “Amen”?"
Motor Disturbance,"Could be inching my way across moth turbulence
(wrong country? Honduras?—No! No! Nepal!)
due to a motor disturbance in some itinerary program computer
that failed to take into account my aversion to hot weather decay
and my love of eternal white silence
the result of a motor disturbance of some solar slope
I keep sliding down thanks to my own personal motor disturbance
the one that makes me puff up and screech (dog stars)
when I’d rather celebrate a White Cliff Mass
with friendly co-innocents in a clean commune above the clouds
where I won’t have to cerebrate how to—how to—rip up stuff
work-oriented ancients painstakingly mass-produced 
in vast sheets of legible shimmering matter
inspired, don’t you know, by a longitude-latitude motor disturbance

so clicky, soppy, so picky—like the one that led me to assume
“disfunction” was Brooklynese for “wedding” (nervous laughter)
which prompted me to dial NERVOUS first thing today

so much of it this time of—of—
the operator’s voice was laden with irony
irony I have no time to savor
due to the motor disturbance of this end-of-year period
which seems to be hurtling down a sleety dynamo
throbbing with hallucinatory instructions
each syllable of which lasts out a year of its own choosing
thanks to a blessed motor disturbance in the Heavens
i.e., your lips, gills, hills, tips—
a very contemporary motor disturbance as gorgeous as blue plates
spinning and wobbling and falling
conjoining to form Sky, replacing the old peeling one…
    Sometimes you must persevere in the face of a huge motor disturbance
that settles on a whole city’s brain like a big black bowl
part of an everywhere-in-the-universe night
like the one I see when the two mountains wrestling each other lie down
which happened in my mind just as I careened into your arms by mistake
to wish you a half-gnawed ear (new motor disturbance, I hate you!)
to wish you a Happy New Year Times (got it right for once)

next to you who can transform stalled traffic into a beautiful panora—

the ecstasy we left our nation in our will
to help it shudder its way through its inventive mole-run
the one its machines invented due to their one great motor disturbance,
the one that was supposed to prevent all the others,
the others that make me unable to figure out why
there’s not one motor disturbance in the January sky
and in the winter air
with you there
everything in my life just seems to jell,

Duo-Tang,"       Laundry so near the ocean bothered Frank.
The lack of medicine on the shelves
       also confused his emotional stance.
       A moth fluttered against his leg.
A gust of wind made his Pepsi keen
       as its foam trickled down inside.
       A banana boat on a horizon otherwise blank
passed over a time-piece buried in valves
       over which sea-growths stirred. Grant’s
       Tomb. Cleopatra’s Needle. The Hague.
He flipped the pages of the travel magazine
       and wondered if Monsieur had lied.
       Tomorrow, he’d go to the bank,
shop for some unguents and skin salves,
       and finish the Castles’ book on the dance.
       The Hesitation Waltz! How vague
the past seemed: static scene after static scene.
       He watched the retreating tide
       and patted his belly. The sun sank.

Shirley Temple Surrounded by Lions,"       In a world where kapok on a sidewalk looks like an “accident”
—innards—would that freckles could enlarge, well, meaningfully
       into kind of friendly brown kingdoms, all isolate,
with a hero’s route, feral glens,
       and a fountain where heroines cool their mouths.
         Scenario: an albino industrialiste, invited to the beach at noon
(and to such old exiles, oceans hardly teem with ambiguities)
       by a lifeguard after her formulae, though in love—
“Prop-men, the gardenias, the mimosa need anti-droopage stuffing.”
       Interestingly slow, the bush and rush filming.
         Hiatus, everyone. After the idea of California sort of took root,
       we found ourselves in this cookie forest; she closed the newspaper,
       groped past cabañas, blanched and ungainly.
             The grips watched Marv and Herm movies of birds tweeting,
       fluttering around and in and out an old boat fridge, on a reef,
       when eek, the door—or was it “eef”—“Shirl” said the starling, end of—

       After that, photos of incinerators in use moved families more than
the candy grass toy that retches. Dogs. For the dressers, Mutations,
       about various feelers. For the extras, movies of revenge that last.
         This spree has to last. “Accept my pink eyes, continual swathing,”
Shirley rehearsed. “Encase me in sand, then let’s get kissy.”
       Do children have integrity,  i.e. eyes? Newsreels, ponder this.
How slow the filming is for a grayish day with its bonnet
       bumping along the pioneer footpath, pulled by—here, yowly hound."
A Sick-Room Idyll,"When Nellie sits beside my bed, 
   She thinks, to please a Poet,
Her talk must be of books, 
   Although I’d rather she’d forego it.
For oft she makes such queer mistakes 
   I must break out in laughter,
And then she looks so grieved, that I 
   Repent the minute after.
Yet though she talks of Ruskin’s plays, 
   Of Dickens’ Tristram Shandy,
There’s none can clearer jellies make, 
   Or match with her in candy.
What though she strays from Pope to Poe 
   With fancy wild and vagrant,
There’s none brings oranges so big 
   Or apples half so fragrant.
And then her eyes are clear and kind, 
   Her mouth is sweet and rosy,
She brings me now chrysanthemums, 
   Now violets in a posy.
Her pastry, too, is always crisp, 
   Her sweets are never gritty,
Her frocks are always neat and fine, 
   Her face is good and pretty.
So while in kindness she is rich, 
   What though her lore be scanty?
What though she talk of Homer’s Faust, 
   Or Don Quixote by Dante?
What though she asks what Jane Eyre wrote?
   If Wordsworth still be living?
O, I forgive her all, for she 
   Herself is so forgiving."
A Valentine That Can’t Be Sent,"1
Your singular, my love. Rehearses its absence.
You see light, hear noise, feel the warmth of the sun. Do you connect it into “day”?
You move through shards and splinters. Toward.
You are no longer possible.
2
Because, my love. The night such a vast space. And you a bird in oblique flight.
I try to hold on. To moments still ours. Even as they slip away.
Each word of yours, each gesture, gently. Once upon no more.
Do not fall again. Not even like an apple in autumn.
3
Because we say: we. We are each hour and each minute. Not altogether alone.
I have looked deep in the eyes of men and women. And feared that lastly. We make no contact.
And yet. The space between.
Can fill with love.
4
I no longer know what to think. About death. Which stands ready.
About you. A hunger hallucinating outward. From the ruins of memory.
Because yes, you. Still make my heart beat.
Irregularly. Like yours."
"[Backlit by the glitter-chopped horizon,]","Backlit by the glitter-chopped horizon, each of these 17 Marbled Godwits poking at the tideline must have a heartbeat; every living, perfect Whimbrel, its eyes. The surf is stacked, tilted, as if it were higher than the beach. There is an urgency to turn home, get this assignment of pleasure done, strike it off the list where vanish will be the last task, and then there is the thought of those 17 hearts. Less rain means more salt, anchovies, more whales—a ferment to savor against a distant cloud of Shearwaters above the incessant upwelling."
The Dustbowl,"       The Harvey Girls invaded Kansas that spring of the famine
nudged by sweet memories of cornfields in the snow.
       Okie weeders. Stranded in the orchards. Huts. Silos.
         Ah, the times they had—huts—racing down avenues
of rattly stalks, droopy and sere, oooo-eeee! roughhousing
       in jeans and poke bonnets until the laundry basin
         announced supper (thwacked) beans and jello (thwacked)
followed by coupling in the sheds. Alas that winter of the famine
       there were no sheds, and still they stayed, sullen
         girls of the south, squinting at yellow skies
out of verboten shacks. Alas that summer of the famine
       they breakfasted on leaves from gullies
         and the air tasted of acorns, ah, the meadows smelled of vanilla.
Alas that winter of the famine, their men lay down on the highways,
       and their women lay down with them, and felt the hot truck wind.
         Alas ladies in the cities, clutching their scalloped hankies,
oiled up the icy sidewalks in the violet dusk
       and hitching up their leather garments, fell and sued.
         Taxes. Caverns. Cereal. Vegetate. Simple gestures
(entering attics, bikes wobbling, dogs sunning)
       lurched into something checkerboard, with every piece
         outsized, gummed to attract the police.
The Harvey Girls slept until came the spring of the glut.
       Thrumming, the weed machines released an ebony menace.
         That summer of the glut, the fields were like monsters in heat,
and the Harvey Girls, freckled and worn, smiled at the northern mistral,
       and headed on mules for the mountains, that autumn of the glut."
Experts at Veneers,"“In Montana, claws skim through the dawn,
herders just saddle up, yes that’s it!
But then, they gulp hiccough pills in the highschools,
not to skip one ambiance in the tunnel of fun!”
  That symbiosis in the garden says to adventure.
The jelly on the daffodil will mildew by July,
and the orange result if the birds come by
will suffice as our capitol, won’t it?
       And I was there, and I was there.
  Here we are, in what seems to be an aerial predicament.
The Government certainly looks handsome in the mackerel sky,
awaiting wind fungus, beribboned in its way, goodbye.

Listening to Nina Simone Sing “Just Like Tom Thumb’s Blues.”,"for DT
Under the comfort of       Cincinnati fog,
                        I listen to your        voice:
                        a   twirl      of
cocoa nib     and bergamot;   an      acre
of semisweet         tenor notes        softly
pushing through          dimpled      loam;
an     onshore wind that cuts
through an Atlantic Ocean            wave.
How you         rub chalk maple     over
the head of      a screech    and       even
make a sweet thing of    the acrid.
While you did not draw        the map
that shows                  the sticky trail
of  Tom’s                  lugubriousness,
                           you    fashioned
the compass that leads         to
the creaky side door of that      hostel
in which he stayed during
his Easter                 sojourn in Juarez.
You, Aunty Nina,    are an   ever ready
synonym for Polaris. Meta-raconteuse,
you dive into the marrow
                                     of the marrow
of a story.
                                  Now that is deep.
I think       I understand it now:   Aunty
Nina, you sing each        woman
into a symbol
of some sort of ascension.
There’s Melinda,   the holder of gloom,
who walks up                            the forever
             of a wooden
                         staircase.
She waits for           the moment
to bear the obsidian              walls
of her mouth and her       honey-lined
gums to any hungry fool      that treks
behind her.
And then, there’s St. Annie, who    is   1.
the patron saint of   miners      in the
         middle earth who sweatily lament
their subterranean homesick blues,        2.
the protectress of    capsized boats and
storms,                                       and 3.
the    hand resting on the boat
of a woman pushing the head of   a storm
through her own middle earth.
Aunty Nina, aren’t these       all metaphors
for reaching skyward?
And wouldn’t you say that
                                     this is your work?
I slow-scratch the                  record      just
to hear the way you stretch       the word
ghost into 6     syllables.
And now there is a hole   on the speaker’s
mesh that takes   the shape of a hexagonal
set  of                   hips. A spirit        pushes
its way   through the busted geometry    of
the record   player.
You: floating, floating, up to the North Star."
Mother's Rules,"for my mother, Agatha Kamara
If you see me praying in the living room, never sit in front of me. You are not God.
  When we go to a restaurant and I don’t know any foods on the menu, never order me a meal that is spelled with silent letters. I came to eat, not to explore.
  You didn’t make food. No. God, did. You cooked food. Watch your English. Watch your faith.
  Your Krio is offensive. When you speak, you sound like Shabba Ranks. Your accent is funny, but keep practicing. It is the only way we will be able to gossip in peace while at the supermarket.
  Try to learn the language of your lover and his family. They could be smiling to your face and getting ready to trade you for 6 goats and 3 mules during your first trip to their homeland.
  If anyone stares at you for too long (more than 5 seconds), start speaking an imaginary language while maintaining eye contact. They will be the first to look away.
  Consider the consequence of purchasing human hair wigs, second hand clothing, and used furniture. Maybe you will feel beautiful, and also save money, but you never know whose bad luck or misfortune will be sitting on your head, body, or in the home in which you sleep. Buy what you can truly afford.
  Your father’s Muslim, so you are too (1989–1993).
I am Christian, so you are too (1993–2012).
I am Catholic now, but you keep praying (2012–present).
  You laugh at me now. Like I laughed at my mother. Like she laughed at hers. Like your daughters will laugh at you. And I will live long enough to forgive your folly.
  Just make sure to pray.
  Amen."

I will follow crumbs of moldy Wonder Bread to find the vanilla-scented
home of the Sugarcane Priestess 
who sweetens my hopeful delirium  
She is ancient understands unspoken posture of my need  
She is so hip realigns round shoulders of my magic  
what if your unrehearsed appearance heralds the age of destination?  
what if the unfolding shadows of your cane-cloth wrap the dance to your music
siphons the source of my indigo moods?

"The Pleasures of Imagination, Book the First","With what attractive charms this goodly frame
Of nature touches the consenting hearts
Of mortal men; and what the pleasing stores
Which beauteous imitation thence derives
To deck the poet’s, or the painter’s toil;
My verse unfolds. Attend, ye gentle POW’RS
OF MUSICAL DELIGHT! and while I sing
Your gifts, your honours, dance around my strain.
Thou, smiling queen of every tuneful breast,
Indulgent FANCY! from the tuneful banks
Of Avon, whence thy rosy fingers cull
Fresh flow’rs and dews to sprinkle on the turf
Where Shakespeare lies, be present: and with thee
Wasting ten thousand colours thro’ the air,
And, by the glances of her magic eye,
Combining each in endless, fairy forms,
Her wild creation. Goddess of the lyre
Which rules the accents of the moving sphere,
Wilt thou, eternal HARMONY! descend, 
And join this festive train? for with thee comes
The guide, the guardian of their lovely sports,
Majestic TRUTH; and where TRUTH deigns to come
Her sister LIBERTY will not be far.
Be present all ye GENII who conduct
The wand’ring footsteps of the youthful bard,
New to your springs and shades: who touch his ear
With finer founds; who heighten to his eye
The bloom of nature, and before him turn
The gayest, happiest attitudes of things.
Oft have the laws of each poetic strain
The critic-verse imploy’d; yet still unsung
Lay this prime subject, tho’ importing most
A poet’s name: for fruitless is th’ attempt
By dull obedience and the curb of rules,
For creeping toil to climb the hard ascent
Of high Parnassus. Nature’s kindling breath
Must fire the chosen genius; nature’s hand
Must point the path, and imp his eagle-wings
Exulting o’er the painful steep to soar
High as the summit; there to breath at large
Aetherial air; with bards and sages old,
Immortal sons of praise. These flatt’ring scenes
To this neglecting labour court my song;
Yet not unconscious what a doubtful task
To paint the finest features of the mind,
And to most subtile and mysterious things
Give colour, strength and motion. But the love
Of nature and the muses bids explore,
Thro’ secret paths erewhile untrod by man,
The fair poetic region, to detect
Untasted springs, to drink inspiring draughts;
And shade my temples with unfading flow’rs.
Cull’d from the laureate vale’s profound recess,
Where never poet gain’d a wreath before.
From heav’n my strains begin; from heaven descends
The flame of genius to the human breast,
And love and beauty, and poetic joy
And inspiration. Ere the radiant sun
Sprung from the east, or ’mid the vault of night
The moon suspended her serener lamp;
Ere mountains, woods, or streams adorn’d the globe;
Or wisdom taught the sons of men her lore;
Then liv’d th’ eternal ONE: then deep-retir’d
In his unfathom’d essence, view’d at large
The uncreated images of things;
The radiant sun, the moon’s nocturnal lamp,
The mountains, woods and streams, the rolling globe,
And wisdom’s form coelestial. From the first
Of days, on them his love divine he fix’d,
His admiration: till in time compleat,
What he admir’d and lov’d, his vital smile
Unfolded into being. Hence the breath
Of life informing each organic frame,
Hence the green earth, and wild resounding waves;
Hence light and shade alternate; warmth and cold;
And clear autumnal skies and vernal show’rs,
And all the fair variety of things.
But not alike to every mortal eye
Is this great scene unveil’d. For since the claims
Of social life, to diff’rent labours urge
The active pow’rs of man; with wise intent
The hand of nature on peculiar minds
Imprints a diff’rent byass, and to each
Decrees its province in the common toil.
To some she taught the fabric of the sphere,
The changeful moon, the circuit of the starrs,
The golden zones of heav’n: to some she gave
To weigh the moment of eternal things,
Of time, and space, and fate's unbroken chain,
And will’s quick impulse: others by the hand
She led o’er vales and mountains, to explore
What healing virtue swells the tender veins
Of herbs and flow’rs; or what the beams of morn
Draw forth, distilling from the clifted rind
In balmy tears. But some, to higher hopes
Were destin’d; some within a finer mould
She wrought, and temper’d with a purer flame.
To these the sire omnipotent unfolds
The world’s harmonious volume, there to read
The transcript of himself. On every part
They trace the bright impressions of his hand:
In earth or air, the meadow’s purple stores,
The moon’s mild radiance, or the virgin’s form
Blooming with rosy smiles, they see portray’d
That uncreated beauty, which delights
The mind supreme. They also feel her charms,
Enamour’d; they partake th’ eternal joy.
As Memnon’s marble harp, renown’d of old
By fabling Nilus, to the quivering touch
Of Titan’s ray, with each repulsive string
Consenting, sounded thro’ the warbling air
Unbidden strains; ev’n so did nature’s hand
To certain species of external things,
Attune the finer organs of the mind:
So the glad impulse of congenial pow’rs,
Or of sweet sound, or fair-proportion’d form,
The grace of motion, or the bloom of light,
Thrills thro’ imagination’s tender frame,
From nerve to nerve: all naked and alive
They catch the spreading rays: till now the soul
At length discloses every tuneful spring,
To that harmonious movement from without,
Responsive. Then the inexpressive strain
Diffuses its inchantment: fancy dreams
Of sacred fountains and Elysian groves,
And vales of bliss: the intellectual pow’r
Bends from his awful throne a wond’ring ear,
And smiles: the passions gently sooth’d away,
Sink to divine repose, and love and joy
Alone are waking; love and joy, serene
As airs that fan the summer. O! attend,
Whoe’er thou art whom these delights can touch,
Whose candid bosom the refining love
Of nature warms, O! listen to my song;
And I will guide thee to her fav’rite walks,
And teach thy solitude her voice to hear,
And point her loveliest features to thy view.
Know then, whate’er of nature’s pregnant stores,
Whate’er of mimic art’s reflected forms
With love and admiration thus inflame
The pow’rs of fancy, her delighted sons
To three illustrious orders have referr’d;
Three sister-graces, whom the painter’s hand,
The poet’s tongue confesses; the sublime,
The wonderful, the fair. I see them dawn!
I see the radiant visions, where they rise,
More lovely than when Lucifer displays
His beaming forehead thro’ the gates of morn,
To lead the train of Phoebus and the spring.
Say, why was man so eminently rais’d
Amid the vast creation; why ordain’d
Thro’ life and death to dart his piercing eye,
With thoughts beyond the limit of his frame;
But that th’ Omnipotent might send him forth
In sight of mortal and immortal pow’rs,
As on a boundless theatre, to run
The great career of justice; to exalt
His gen’rous aim to all diviner deeds;
To shake each partial purpose from his breast;
And thro’ the mists of passion and of sense,
And thro’ the tossing tide of chance and pain
To hold his course unfalt’ring, while the voice
Of truth and virtue, up the steep ascent
Of nature, calls him to his high reward,
Th’ applauding smile of heav’n? Else wherefore burns
In mortal bosoms, this unquenched hope
That breathes from day to day sublimer things,
And mocks possession? wherefore darts the mind,
With such resistless ardor to embrace
Majestic forms? impatient to be free,
Spurning the gross controul of wilful might;
Proud of the strong contention of her toils;
Proud to be daring? Who but rather turns
To heav’n’s broad fire his unconstrained view,
Than to the glimm’ring of a waxen flame?
Who that, from Alpine heights, his lab’ring eye
Shoots round the wide horizon to survey
The Nile or Ganges rowl his wasteful tide
Thro’ mountains, plains, thro’ empires black with shade,
And continents of sand; will turn his gaze
To mark the windings of a scanty rill
That murmurs at his feet? The high-born soul
Disdains to rest her heav’n-aspiring wing
Beneath its native quarry. Tir’d of earth
And this diurnal scene, she springs aloft
Thro’ fields of air; pursues the flying storm;
Rides on the volley’d lightning thro’ the heav’ns;
Or yok’d with whirlwinds and the northern blast,
Sweeps the long tract of day. Then high she soars
The blue profound, and hovering o’er the sun,
Beholds him pouring the redundant stream
Of light; beholds his unrelenting sway
Bend the reluctant planets to absolve
The fated rounds of time. Thence far effus’d
She darts her swiftness up the long career
Of devious comets; thro’ its burning signs
Exulting circles the perennial wheel
Of nature, and looks back on all the starrs,
Whose blended light, as with a milky zone,
Invests the orient. Now amaz’d she views
Th’ empyreal waste, where happy spirits hold,
Beyond this concave heav’n, their calm abode;
And fields of radiance, whose unfading light
Has travell’d the profound six thousand years,
Nor yet arrives in sight of mortal things.
Ev’n on the barriers of the world untir’d
She meditates th’ eternal depth below;
Till, half recoiling, down the headlong steep
She plunges; soon o’erwhelm’d and swallow’d up
In that immense of being. There her hopes
Rest at the fated goal. For from the birth
Of mortal man, the sov’reign Maker said,
That not in humble or in brief delight,
Not in the fading echoes of renown,
Pow’rs purple robes, or pleasure’s flow’ry lap,
The soul should find injoyment: but from these
Turning disdainful to an equal good,
Thro’ all th’ ascent of things inlarge her view,
Till every bound at length should disappear,
And infinite perfection close the scene.
Call now to mind what high, capacious pow’rs
Lie folded up in man; how far beyond
The praise of mortals, may th’ eternal growth
Of nature to perfection half divine,
Expand the blooming soul? What pity then
Should sloth’s unkindly fogs depress to earth
Her tender blossom; choak the streams of life,
And blast her spring! Far otherwise design’d
Almighty wisdom; nature’s happy cares
Th’obedient heart far otherwise incline.
Witness the sprightly joy when aught unknown
Strikes the quick sense, and wakes each active pow’r
To brisker measures: witness the neglect
Of all familiar prospects, tho’ beheld
With transport once; the fond, attentive gaze
Of young astonishment; the sober zeal
Of age, commenting on prodigious things.
For such the bounteous providence of heav’n,
In every breast implanting this desire
Of objects new and strange, to urge us on
With unremitted labour to pursue
Those sacred stores that wait the ripening soul,
In truth’s exhaustless bosom. What need words
To paint its pow’r? For this, the daring youth
Breaks from his weeping mother’s anxious arms,
In foreign climes to rove: the pensive sage
Heedless of sleep, or midnight’s harmful damp,
Hangs o’er the sickly taper; and untir’d
The virgin follows, with inchanted step,
The mazes of some wild and wond’rous tale,
From morn to eve; unmindful of her form,
Unmindful of the happy dress that stole
The wishes of the youth, when every maid
With envy pin’d. Hence finally, by night
The village-matron, round the blazing hearth,
Suspends the infant-audience with her tales,
Breathing astonishment! of witching rhymes,
And evil spirits; of the death-bed call
To him who robb’d the widow, and devour’d
The orphan’s portion; of unquiet souls
Ris’n from the grave to ease the heavy guilt
Of deeds in life conceal’d; of shapes that walk
At dead of night, and clank their chains, and wave
The torch of hell around the murd’rer’s bed.
At every solemn pause the croud recoil
Gazing each other speechless, and congeal’d
With shiv’ring sighs: till eager for th’ event,
Around the beldame all arrect they hang,
Each trembling heart with grateful terrors quell’d.
But lo! disclos’d in all her smiling pomp,
Where BEAUTY onward moving claims the verse
Her charms inspire: the freely-flowing verse
In thy immortal praise, O form divine,
Smooths her mellifluent stream. Thee, BEAUTY, thee
The regal dome, and thy enlivening ray
The mossy roofs adore: thou, better sun!
For ever beamest on th’ inchanted heart
Love, and harmonious wonder, and delight
Poetic. Brightest progeny of heav’n!
How shall I trace thy features? where select
The roseate hues to emulate thy bloom?
Haste then, my song, thro’ nature’s wide expanse,
Haste then, and gather all her comeliest wealth,
Whate’er bright spoils the florid earth contains,
Whate’er the waters, or the liquid air,
To deck thy lovely labour. Wilt thou fly
With laughing Autumn to th’Atlantic isles,
And range with him th’Hesperian field, and see,
Where’er his fingers touch the fruitful grove,
The branches shoot with gold; where’er his step
Marks the glad soil, the tender clusters glow
With purple ripeness, and invest each hill
As with the blushes of an evening sky?
Or wilt thou rather stoop thy vagrant plume,
Where, gliding thro’ his daughter’s honour’d shades,
The smooth Penéus from his glassy flood
Reflects purpureal Tempe’s pleasant scene?
Fair Tempe! haunt belov’d of fylvan pow’rs,
Of nymphs and fauns; where in the golden age
They play'd in secret on the shady brink
With ancient Pan: while round their choral steps
Young hours and genial gales with constant hand
Show’r’d blossoms, odours, show’r’d ambrosial dews,
And spring’s Elysian bloom. Her flow’ry store
To thee nor Tempe shall refuse; nor watch
Of winged Hydra guard Hesperian fruits
From thy free spoil. O bear then, unreprov’d,
Thy smiling treasures to the green recess
Where young Dione stays. With sweetest airs
Intice her forth to lend her angel-form
For beauty’s honour’d image. Hither turn
Thy graceful footsteps; hither, gentle maid,
Incline thy polish’d forehead: let thy eyes
Effuse the mildness of their azure dawn;
And may the fanning breezes waft aside
Thy radiant locks, disclosing as it bends
With airy softness from the marble neck
The cheek fair-blooming, and the rosy lip
Where winning smiles and pleasure sweet as love,
With sanctity and wisdom, temp’ring blend
Their soft allurement. Then the pleasing force
Of nature, and her kind parental care,
Worthier I’d sing: then all th’ enamour’d youth,
With each admiring virgin to my lyre
Should throng attentive, while I point on high
Where beauty’s living image, like the morn
That wakes in Zephyr’s arms the blushing May,
Moves onward; or as Venus, when she stood
Effulgent on the pearly car, and smil’d,
Fresh from the deep, and conscious of her form,
To see the Tritons tune their vocal shells,
And each coerulean sister of the flood
With fond acclaim attend her o'er the waves,
To seek th’ Idalian bow’r. Ye smiling band
Of youths and virgins, who thro’ all the maze
Of young desire with rival-steps pursue
This charm of beauty; if the pleasing toil
Can yield a moment's respite, hither turn
Your favourable ear, and trust my words.
I do not mean to wake the gloomy form
Of superstition drest in wisdom’s garb,
To damp your tender hopes; I do not mean
To bid the jealous thund’rer fire the heav’ns,
Or shapes infernal rend the groaning earth
To fright you from your joys: my chearful song
With better omens calls you to the field,
Pleas’d with your gen’rous ardour in the chace,
And warm as you. Then tell me, for you know,
Does beauty ever deign to dwell where health
And active use are strangers? Is her charm
Confess’d in aught, whose most peculiar ends
Are lame and fruitless? Or did nature mean
This awful stamp the herald of a lye;
To hide the shame of discord and disease,
And catch with fair hypocrisy the heart
Of idle faith? O no! with better cares,
Th’ indulgent mother, conscious how infirm
Her offspring tread the paths of good and ill,
By this illustrious image, in each kind
Still most illustrious where the object holds
Its native pow’rs most perfect, she by this
Illumes the headlong impulse of desire,
And sanctifies his choice. The generous glebe
Whose bosom smiles with verdure, the clear tract
Of streams delicious to the thirsty soul,
The bloom of nectar’d fruitage ripe to sense,
And every charm of animated things,
Are only pledges of a state sincere,
Th’ integrity and order of their frame,
When all is well within, and every end
Accomplish’d. Thus was beauty sent from heav’n,
The lovely ministress of truth and good
In this dark world: for truth and good are one,
And beauty dwells in them, and they in her,
With like participation. Wherefore then,
O sons of earth! would you dissolve the tye?
O wherefore, with a rash, imperfect aim,
Seek you those flow’ry joys with which the hand
Of lavish fancy paints each flatt’ring scene
Where beauty seems to dwell, nor once inquire
Where is the sanction of eternal truth,
Or where the seal of undeceitful good,
To save your search from folly? Wanting these,
Lo! beauty withers in your void imbrace,
And with the glitt’ring of an idiot’s toy
Did fancy mock your vows. Nor let the gleam
Of youthful hope that shines upon your hearts,
Be chill’d or clouded at this awful task
To learn the lore of undeceitful good,
And truth eternal. Tho’ the pois’nous charms
Of baleful superstition, guide the feet
Of servile numbers, thro’ a dreary way
To their abode, thro’ desarts, thorns and mire;
And leave the wretched pilgrim all forlorn
To muse, at last, amid the ghostly gloom
Of graves, and hoary vaults, and cloister’d cells;
To walk with spectres thro’ the midnight shade,
And to the screaming owl’s accursed song
Attune the dreadful workings of his heart;
Yet be not you dismay’d. A gentler star
Your lovely search illumines. From the grove
Where wisdom talk’d with her Athenian sons,
Could my ambitious hand intwine a wreath
Of PLATO’S olive with the Mantuan bay,
Then should my pow’rful voice at once dispel
These monkish horrors: then in light divine
Disclose th’ Elysian prospect, where the steps
Of those whom nature charms, thro’ blooming walks,
Thro’ fragrant mountains and poetic streams,
Amid the train of sages, heroes, bards,
Led by their winged Genius and the choir
Of laurell’d science and harmonious art,
Proceed exulting to th’ eternal shrine,
Where truth inthron’d with her coelestial twins,
The undivided part’ners of her sway,
With good and beauty reigns. O let not us,
Lull’d by luxurious pleasure’s languid strain,
Or crouching to the frowns of bigot-rage,
O let not us a moment pause to join
The god-like band. And if the gracious pow’r
That first awaken’d my untutor’d song,
Will to my invocation breathe anew
The tuneful spirit; then thro’ all our paths,
Ne’er shall the sound of this devoted lyre
Be wanting; whether on the rosy mead,
When summer smiles, to warn the melting heart
Of luxury’s allurement; whether firm
Against the torrent and the stubborn hill
To urge bold virtue’s unremitted nerve,
And wake the strong divinity of soul
That conquers chance and fate; or whether struck
For sounds of triumph, to proclaim her toils
Upon the lofty summit, round her brow
To twine the wreathe of incorruptive praise;
To trace her hallow’d light thro’ future worlds,
And bless heav’n’s image in the heart of man.
Thus with a faithful aim have we presum’d,
Advent’rous, to delineate nature’s form;
Whether in vast, majestic pomp array’d,
Or drest for pleasing wonder, or serene
In beauty’s rosy smile. It now remains,
Thro’ various being’s fair-proportion’d scale,
To trace the rising lustre of her charms,
From their first twilight, shining forth at length
To full meridian splendour. Of degree
The least and lowliest, in th’effusive warmth
Of colours mingling with a random blaze,
Doth beauty dwell. Then higher in the line
And variation of determin’d shape,
Where truth’s eternal measures mark the bound
Of circle, cube, or sphere. The third ascent
Unites this varied symmetry of parts
With colour’s bland allurement; as the pearl
Shines in the concave of its azure bed,
And painted shells indent their speckled wreathe.
Then more attractive rise the blooming forms
Thro’ which the breath of nature has infus’d
Her genial pow’r to draw with pregnant veins
Nutritious moisture from the bounteous earth,
In fruit and seed prolific: thus the flow’rs
Their purple honours with the spring resume;
And such the stately tree which autumn bends
With blushing treasures. But more lovely still
Is nature’s charm, where to the full consent
Of complicated members, to the bloom
Of colour, and the vital change of growth,
Life’s holy flame and piercing sense are giv’n,
And active motion speaks the temper’d soul:
So moves the bird of Juno; so the steed
With rival ardour beats the dusty plain,
And faithful dogs with eager airs of joy
Salute their fellows. Thus doth beauty dwell
There most conspicuous, ev’n in outward shape,
Where dawns the high expression of a mind:
By steps conducting our inraptur’d search
To that eternal origin, whose pow’r,
Thro’ all th’ unbounded symmetry of things,
Like rays effulging from the parent sun,
This endless mixture of her charms diffus’d.
MIND, MIND alone, bear witness, earth and heav’n!
The living fountains in itself contains
Of beauteous and sublime: here hand in hand,
Sit paramount the Graces; here inthron’d,
Coelestial Venus, with divinest airs,
Invites the soul to never-fading joy.
Looks then abroad thro’ nature, to the range
Of planets, suns, and adamantine spheres
Wheeling unshaken thro’ the void immense;
And speak, O man! does this capacious scene
With half that kindling majesty dilate
Thy strong conception, as when Brutus rose
Refulgent from the stroke of Caesar’s fate,
Amid the croud of patriots; and his arm
Aloft extending, like eternal Jove
When guilt brings down the thunder, call’d aloud
On Tully’s name, and shook his crimson steel,
And bade the father of his country, hail!
For lo! the tyrant prostrate on the dust,
And Rome again is free? — Is aught so fair
In all the dewy landscapes of the spring,
In the bright eye of Hesper or the morn,
In nature’s fairest forms, is aught so fair
As virtuous friendship? as the candid blush
Of him who strives with fortune to be just?
The graceful tear that streams for other's woes?
Or the mild majesty of private life,
Where peace with ever-blooming olive crowns,
The gate; where honour’s liberal hands effuse
Unenvy’d treasures, and the snowy wings
Of innocence and love protect the scene?
Once more search, undismay’d, the dark profound
Where nature works in secret; view the beds
Of min’ral treasure, and th’ eternal vault
That bounds the hoary ocean; trace the forms
Of atoms moving with incessant change
Their elemental round; behold the seeds
Of being, and the energy of life
Kindling the mass with ever-active flame:
Then to the secrets of the working mind
Attentive turn; from dim oblivion call
Her fleet, ideal band; and bid them, go!
Break thro’ time’s barrier, and o’ertake the hour
That saw the heav’ns created: then declare
If aught were found in those external scenes
To move thy wonder now. For what are all
The forms which brute, unconscious matter wears,
Greatness of bulk, or symmetry of parts?
Not reaching to the heart, soon feeble grows
The superficial impulse; dull their charms,
And satiate soon, and pall the languid eye.
Not so the moral species, or the pow’rs
Of genius and design; th’ ambitious mind
There sees herself: by these congenial forms
Touch’d and awaken’d, with intenser act
She bends each nerve, and meditates well-pleas’d
Her features in the mirror. For of all
Th’ inhabitants of earth, to man alone
Creative wisdom gave to lift his eye
To truth’s eternal measures; thence to frame
The sacred laws of action and of will,
Discerning justice from unequal deeds,
And temperance from folly. But beyond
This energy of truth, whose dictates bind
Assenting reason, the benignant sire,
To deck the honour’d paths of just and good,
Has added bright imagination’s rays:
Where virtue rising from the awful depth
Of truth’s mysterious bosom, doth forsake
The unadorn’d condition of her birth;
And dress’d by fancy in ten thousand hues,
Assumes a various feature, to attract,
With charms responsive to each gazer’s eye,
The hearts of men. Amid his rural walk,
Th’ ingenuous youth whom solitude inspires
With purest wishes, from the pensive shade
Beholds her moving, like a virgin-muse
That wakes her lyre to some indulgent theme
Of harmony and wonder: while among
The herd of servile minds, her strenuous form
Indignant flashes on the patriot’s eye,
And thro’ the rolls of memory appeals
To ancient honour; or in act serene,
Yet watchful, raises the majestic sword
Of public pow’r, from dark ambition’s reach
To guard the sacred volume of the laws.
Genius of ancient Greece! whose faithful steps
Well-pleas’d I follow thro’ the sacred paths
Of nature and of science; nurse divine
Of all heroic deeds and fair desires!
O! let the breath of thy extended praise
Inspire my kindling bosom to the height
Of this untemper’d theme. Nor be my thoughts
Presumptuous counted, if, amid the calm
That sooths this vernal evening into smiles,
I steal impatient from the sordid haunts
Of strife and low ambition, to attend
Thy sacred presence in the sylvan shade,
By their malignant footsteps ne’er profan’d.
Descend, propitious! to my favour’d eye;
Such in thy mien, thy warm, exalted air,
As when the Persian tyrant, foil’d and stung
With shame and desperation, gnash’d his teeth
To see thee rend the pageants of his throne;
And at the lightning of thy lifted spear
Crouch’d like a slave. Bring all thy martial spoils,
Thy palms, thy laurels, thy triumphal songs,
Thy smiling band of arts, thy godlike sires
Of civil wisdom, thy heroic youth
Warm from the schools of glory. Guide my way
Thro’ fair Lycéum’s walk, the green retreats
Of Academus, and the thymy vale,
Where oft inchanted with Socratic sounds,
Ilissus pure devolv’d his tuneful stream
In gentler murmurs. From the blooming store
Of these auspicious fields, may I unblam’d
Transplant some living blossoms to adorn
My native clime: while far above the flight
Of fancy’s plume aspiring, I unlock
The springs of ancient wisdom; while I join
Thy name, thrice honour’d! with th’immortal praise
Of nature; while to my compatriot youth
I point the high example of thy sons,
And tune to Attic themes the British lyre."

Breeding at the End of the World,"All the animals in my infant’s world 
are almost extinct. She is wrapped 
in a brown bear towel after I wash 
her in a bath shaped like a whale.  
What little I know of whales and mothering. 
A wide-eyed tortoise glows green into the night
making her room a starry starry night.  
A galaxy, a wonder world, 
her menagerie is full of mothers. 
The panda and her baby ball of cotton wrapped 
in matching flannel. The whale, 
another, hangs alongside a wash 
of nearly dead mammal mothers. They wash
over her as she gives into the night
hum of rhino, lion, narwhal,  
and giraffe spinning above her head. What world
am I leaving her? Each night I wrap 
myself in sheets and cry. Is this mothering?  
A baby elephant lays down to starve when its mother 
is killed. A baby polar bear washes 
itself in snow unaware of its melting. Wrapped 
around its young, an orangutan builds another night
nest to replace its stolen arboreal world. 
Statistics swallow me whole. She wails
into the dark that’s heavy as a whale’s 
sunken skeleton. My mother 
did not warn me of this sad sad world. 
We dream feed, both half asleep and washed 
in milk. It’s a marvel we survive each night. 
The morning heat slants through the room and wraps 
everything in prisms. She wakes and wraps 
her fingers around mine, spouts bubbles like a whale.
I kiss her toes with red wolf gnarls. My nightmare 
lingers. I whisper mama, mama 
to her nose and sing a Spanish song of colors to wash
away the troubles of this mundo.  
My tiny whale, how much I want the world 
to feel like home tonight. The sky washes
everything it touches, wraps us tightly like our mother. "
Squatter in the Foreground,"—for Ann Lauterbach
We rake the past, down to an ounce of wants.
Meant to begin in haybarn dorm of overall kerchiefs,
an empire of cow sphincters on the hook by May.
I think I’ll stare at the muss to endure
all I am: nonstop strands, new dues to pay up.

Air dense with leavings, fridge hum clicks off.
Nothing on the easel, so nothing melts.
The story thus far: pair of angels swish across grass
into dim room. Wrestlers. Big mirrors, stacks of ’em.
White walls lift. An Anglo-Saxon pause for identification."

The Star Dial,"Δέδυκε μὲν ἀ σελάννα
καὶ Πληΐαδες
          —Sappho
When the moon was high I waited,
   Pale with evening’s tints it shone;
When its gold came slow, belated,
   Still I kept my watch alone
When it sank, a golden wonder,
   From my window still I bent,
Though the clouds hung thick with thunder
   Where our hilltop roadway went.
By the cypress tops I’ve counted
   Every golden star that passed;
Weary hours they’ve shone and mounted,
   Each more tender than the last.
All my pillows hot with turning,
   All my weary maids asleep;
Every star in heaven was burning
   For the tryst you did not keep.
Now the clouds have hushed their warning,
   Paleness creeps upon the sea;
One star more, and then the morning—
   Share, oh, share that star with me!
Never fear that I shall chide thee
   For the wasted stars of night,
So thine arms will come and hide me
   From the dawn’s unwelcome light.
Though the moon a heav’n had given us,
   Every star a crown and throne,
Till the morn apart had driven us—
   Let the last star be our own.
Ah! the cypress tops are sighing
   With the wind that brings the day;
There my last pale treasure dying
   Ebbs in jeweled light away;
Ebbs like water bright, untasted;
   Black the cypress, bright the sea;
Heav’n’s whole treasury lies wasted
   And the dawn burns over me."

earlier that night, men load the boat
with hand-written wishes, the misfortunes
and plague of my past year to be piloted
up to the heavens in a blast of fireworks
deafening the crowd that came to bear witness
to ceremony; we observe as each of us does
some of us bail out before a thing is done
to escape our ghosts; we watch it burn;
I can’t unsnarl the knot of unmet needs,
so I sever it in heat, draw the cord into flame
to free myself from the clutch of haunting, to disembark
at the latitude of where I give up the ship "
Poem,"for Wolfgang Laib
a life
of collecting pollen
from hazelnut bushes
a life of gathering word-grains 
to find all you have wanted
all you have waited to say
five

we cannot climb
hills we cannot touch 
perhaps we are only here
to say house, bridge, or gate
a passage
to somewhere else 
yellow molecules 
spooned and sifted 
from a jar filled with

pouring
milk over stone
you are the energy
that breaks form

White Attic,"The white attic rests
among dripping trees

with unrolling tunnels
and trembling luggage

around were dens
all kinds of dens

and dazzling fruit
to weary the wind

the sun would end

tenderly relaxed

the urn faces a tree
of unequal height

when it came I grew
moved to two rooms in town

where I reach out at night

Screened by sandy lashes, their eyes vanished under their upper lids, up, up. Slick but not quite right—maimed buck look. But that’s what comes of years of flopping down anywhere, California-style, new professions zinging past, combinations and possible combinations that make you drool (gasp), aghast. Dumb come-on, none-the-less, to bank on the built-in climax that comes from realizing the death seizure is just a simulated orgasm moue.
Had to add screech-of-brakes, a shadowy forest for the secret police in black raincoats, alternating with white stone streets (parched Old World). One-to-one visual ratio teeters. The stone streets take over, shutters bang shut, doors slam like crazy, inside locks click. Some outrage no civilized person wants any part of is about to be committed. A monster must be loose.
Climbing into my bathrobe is like putting on a window—two windows, to be exact, one front and one back, a window with just enough give for one’s body contours, a window with regular panes. Blue sky view. It’s two (sundial). The bride has confetti in her hair and veil. The hippie groom must have a sweet tooth—he’s sneaking white icing into his mouth behind her back. In the distance, pyramids. Big statues of watchdogs form a circle around everything. So much vastness in one fell swoop, desert vastness, makes me want to cry when I look at it reflected, having, sandwiched myself between two mirrors.
Good. The maintenance men, rhinestone studs on their boots, monicker studs, are flushing out the feeder tubes with their mouths. The gland extracts should be coming through any second, front and back. The little teat wants more, more! Yaow! Ruff, ruff! Now its twin wants more too. Fair is fair, but, new feeder sequence inserted, they’ve packed up their gear. No more severed arteries today.

from “A Season in Hell [Delirium I]”,"Translated from the French by James Sibley Watson
          “I was witness of all the adornments with which he surrounded himself in spirit; garments, cloths, furniture; I lent him weapons, a different face. I saw all that touched him, just as he would have liked to create it for himself. When his spirit seemed to me apathetic, I followed him far in strange and complicated actions, good or bad; I was certain never to enter his world. Beside his dear, sleeping body, what hours I have watched at night, seeking to learn why he was so anxious to escape from reality. Never was there a man with such a vow as that. I recognized,—without being afraid for him,—that he might be a serious danger to society.—Perhaps he possesses secrets that will change life. No, I replied to myself, he is only looking for them. Finally his kindness is enchanted, and I am its prisoner. No other soul would have the strength,—the strength of despair!—to endure it, to be loved and protected by him. Besides, I would not picture him to myself with another soul: one sees his Angel, never another’s Angel,—I believe. I used to exist in his soul as in a palace, which they have made empty in order not to see so mean a person as yourself: that was all. Alas! I was very dependent on him. But what did he want of my colourless and facile being? He would not improve me, unless he were to make me die. Sadly mortified, I sometimes would say to him:
           “‘I understand you.’ He would shrug his shoulders.
         “Thus, with my vexation renewing itself daily, finding myself more and more altered in my own eyes—as in all eyes which might have cared to look at me, had I not been condemned everlastingly to the oblivion of all men!—I grew hungrier and hungrier for his kindness. With kisses and friendly embraces, it was indeed a heaven, a gloomy heaven, which I entered, and where I should have wished to be left, poor, deaf, dumb, blind. Already I had the habit of it. I used to see us as good children, free to walk in the Paradise of sadness. We were in harmony with one another. Much affected, we would work together. But after a poignant caress, he would say: ‘How funny it will seem to you when I am no longer here, through whom you have passed. When you no longer have my arms under your neck, nor my heart to fall asleep on, nor this mouth upon your eyes. For I shall have to go away, very far, some day. Besides, I must help others; it is my duty. Although this may not be especially appetizing to you . . . dear friend.’ All at once I foresaw myself, with him gone, the prey of dizziness, plunged into the most frightful shadow: death. I used to make him promise that he would not abandon me. He gave it twenty times, that lover’s promise. It was as frivolous as my saying to him:
          “‘I understand you.’
    extrait de «Une Saison en Enfer [Délires I]»
            «Je voyais tout le décor dont, en esprit, il s’entourait; vêtements, draps, meubles: je lui prêtais des armes, une autre figure. Je voyais tout ce qui le touchait, comme il aurait voulu le créer pour lui. Quand il me semblait avoir l’esprit inerte, je le suivais, moi, dans des actions étranges et compliquées, loin, bonnes ou mauvaises: j’étais sûre de ne jamais entrer dans son monde. À côté de son cher corps endormi, que d’heures des nuits j’ai veillé, cherchant pourquoi il voulait tant s’évader de la réalité. Jamais homme n’eût pareil vœu. Je reconnaissais,—sans craindre pour lui,—qu’il pouvait être un sérieux danger dans la société.—Il a peut-être des secrets pour changer la vie? Non, il ne fait qu’en chercher, me répliquais-je. Enfin sa charité est ensorcelée, et j’en suis la prisonnière. Aucune autre âme n’aurait assez de force,—force de désespoir!—pour la supporter,—pour être protégée et aimée par lui. D’ailleurs, je ne me le figurais pas avec une autre âme: on voit son Ange, jamais l’Ange d’un autre,—je crois. J’étais dans son âme comme dans un palais qu’on a vidé pour ne pas voir une personne si peu noble que vous: voilà tout. Hélas! je dépendais bien de lui. Mais que voulait-il avec mon existence terne et lâche? Il ne me rendait pas meilleure, s’il ne me faisait pas mourir! Tristement dépitée, je lui dis quelquefois: «Je te comprends.» Il haussait les épaules.
          «Ainsi, mon chagrin se renouvelant sans cesse, et me trouvant plus égarée à mes yeux,—comme à tous les yeux qui auraient voulu me fixer, si je n’eusse été condamnée pour jamais à l’oubli de tous!—j’avais de plus en plus faim de sa bonté. Avec ses baisers et ses étreintes amies, c’était bien un ciel, un sombre ciel, où j’entrais, et où j’aurais voulu être laissée, pauvre, sourde, muette, aveugle. Déjà j’en prenais l’habitude. Je nous voyais comme deux bons enfants, libres de se promener dans le Paradis de tristesse. Nous nous accordions. Bien émus, nous travaillions ensemble. Mais, après une pénétrante caresse, il disait: «Comme ça te paraîtra drôle, quand je n’y serai plus, ce par quoi tu as passé. Quand tu n’auras plus mes bras sous ton cou, ni mon cœur pour t’y reposer, ni cette bouche sur tes yeux. Parce qu’il faudra que je m’en aille, très-loin, un jour. Puis il faut que j’en aide d’autres: c’est mon devoir. Quoique ce ne soit guère ragoûtant . . . , chère âme . . .» Tout de suite je me pressentais, lui parti, en proie au vertige, précipitée dans l’ombre la plus affreuse: la mort. Je lui faisais promettre qu’il ne me lâcherait pas. Il l’a faite vingt fois, cette promesse d’amant. C’était aussi frivole que moi lui disant: «Je te comprends.»"
Letter on Alladat,"            O these bonds packed with zeroes—harmony, grief, regrets. I’m done with memory. And every time I listen to your poetry, nausea becomes a river in me in which I swim naked, dispossessed.
            I’m making a fetish of everyone dead, my electrons black with heat and sound.
            O my thousand delicate microaggressions, bound up with a hunger I can never grasp. Keep me safe, erotic. Be a mirror to these movements of bourgeois frustration.
            In these wee early hours, know that it has become very hard for me to tell apart the odds on fornication from a staggering, and at times quite foolish, feeling of abjection; as such, my sex might as well have been written down in algebra columns.
            The following notes were written in prison, under forced labour, that is, in the dismal intervals and caesuras in which, to proclaim my virtue, I had to consent to being bludgeoned to death by pigs.
            I’ve yet to overcome. Indeed, I’ve been destroyed so many times my probationer, in anger and disgust, had to void each letter so as to weigh down what is meant by free on appeal.
            O my decadent counter-revolution. My beautiful mechanism. What matters most is not invention, force or calculation, but what it means to suffer the fate of failure, and to learn from it.
            (A mistake made by the struggle. As Césaire knew—only too well—modern revolt needs a black clarity of vision.)
            As for the wonder communicated by metaphor—I have spent many mornings watching a monkey open a cowrie shell.
            The scene reminds me of Landscape of a Man Killed by a Snake, but, on further reflection, the verses seem more intimately bound up with the Koran as read by Malcolm.
            We need to scribble an x on the walls of our collective resurrection. We need to let the right one in.
            (What worries me most about the absolute is that it has no depth, but is all surface.)
            To become zealous, indecent, as we bleed out at sunrise. For that is the contract. You can fuck all the rest."

Vote Your Way to Hell,"It’s a long and arduous journey.
Starving with numbness.
Tired of mixing kindness and sabotage.
You can’t trust instinct.
After the election, you can’t believe the weather is wrong again.
The sky cheats on your speech.
The process is complicated and precarious.
Disappointed, there’s no word of a sad sneer.
Nothing has changed.
What else do you expect?
This is already a hell, paved by your blood and passion.
You’d rather go back to the womb, it’s warmer.
May other reckless souls be consumed.
Even so, I want everyone to vote.
Vote your way to an alternative hell.
Congratulations!
You’re part of the construction of our living inferno.
Here, keep cracking and burning bones as fuel.
The walls scream for mercy, sounding like your singing voice.
Many innocent young souls are recognized.
Vote! You deserve limbo, not war.
We need to keep walking in the dark, searching for hellfire and passing offspring an improbable spring and a maybe sunrise."
from “. . . Again”,"We walked toward the zenith not expecting a new rising sun, but satisfied with the Cheese Whiz, Zebra Cakes, and Zingers at the end of the aisle at Family Dollar. Maybe eat them with Prozac or Zoloft. Later, take in the pine trees rising behind the cinderblock walls of the Dollar Tree. The American alphabet ends like every American factory ends. Zombies wandering around on Zoom. The new zoology. In the Ocean State Job Lot parking lot, I put the words “cheap America lot” into Business Name Generator and got these results: Balaclava America, Zip Cheap, Burb Lot. Nothing much more needs to be said. Maybe there will be more zebras someday. More songs by a reconfigured ZZ Top (you will or will not listen to them on Amazon music). But for now, there are intermezzos, piazzas, and paparazzi for the elites on their mega-yachts, on their spaceship trips into outer space. Meanwhile, the working class orders a pizza delivered by the working class. Zero tolerance for everything and everyone else. Let the Dominoes fall."
Sonnet for Ochún,"After my left arm I washed my right, neck, décolletage,
and navel. I ate ground meat with large crystals of imported salt.
The women and men who would stroke my hair if I asked,
I thought of them fondly then sadly. At the flea market,
what I touched with a fingernail was a copper lamp, a mundane
painting of mountains, the cashier’s hum. I bought nothing I didn’t
want. In the cul-de-sac, I found clouds on leashes, loose roosters.
I thought thoughts ugly as clothespins. Reading a used book,
I suspected I knew less about death than the last person who held it.
I spat into a mirrored sink. I lost my slippers and face. To feel more
like water, I drank it. Before bed, I walked my plank of uncertainties
and plunged further into uncertainty. Am I capturing all of history
in this gesture? I shouted into the future. In the wet air of the future,
I could have but never appeared. No one was sorry but me."
from “All About You”,"Fog—
The needle this morning wavers indifferently
Beauty—not-beauty—
The median and mode of your days—
Impassive sky against your forehead blocking any chance of feeling eager,
But also dulling greed
Something approaches in the lull—
Not exactly beauty but the chance of an answer to your yes-or-no question,
The eightball’s icosahedron . . .
Am I even suited to this—
Writing to save your life—pushing on past every clumsy letter—
Hoping for a flower?
“The Magic 8 Ball contains a 20-sided die with 10 positive answers, 5 negative answers, and 5 vague responses”
Shake it, shake it!
That’s your sense of form"
"[It was deep April, and the morn]","It was deep April, and the morn
          Shakspear was born;
The world was on us, pressing sore;
My Love and I took hands and swore,
   Against the world, to be
Poets and lovers ever more,
To laugh and dream on Lethe’s shore,
To sing to Charon in his boat,
Heartening the timid souls afloat;
Of judgment never to take heed,
But to those fast-locked souls to speed,
Who never from Apollo fled,
Who spent no hour among the dead;
          Continually
          With them to dwell,
Indifferent to heaven and hell."
The New Remorse,"The sin was mine; I did not understand.
        So now is music prisoned in her cave,
        Save where some ebbing desultory wave
Frets with its restless whirls this meagre strand.
And in the withered hollow of this land
        Hath Summer dug herself so deep a grave,
        That hardly can the leaden willow crave
One silver blossom from keen Winter’s hand.
But who is this who cometh by the shore?
(Nay, love, look up and wonder!) Who is this
        Who cometh in dyed garments from the South?
It is thy new-found Lord, and he shall kiss
        The yet unravished roses of thy mouth,
And I shall weep and worship, as before."
Pilgrimage,"The arch of my foot aches.

Soon, we’re walking through nettles, a yellow paddock,

               fresh ginger packed between the gum

And tooth.

In excess, sugars become fat, a kind

               of sealant. Organs bleating

On the forest floor.

A first step.

Blue radiance, paper that receives ink, coffee with cream. By day 8,

               I can’t remember life

With my family."
Malice,"I have violence in me, of rage, and of necessity, and my love has none.

When pushed to it I would punch a man, or maybe wield a gun, but I am stopped by his pure disgust.

This is something new in me: I have sometimes wished death, where I hadn’t before.

While I wasn’t looking it left me, some of my tenderness, and in leaving something tensed where it had been.

Like A., praying for the man to get hit by a car who yelled at me so loudly, for so long, followed us to keep yelling.

There is malice in the world, and maybe some of it is ours now.

“Why should I cater to you” he said to me, so loudly, in my white high-waisted shorts and my clogs like my mom’s with my hair piled on top of my head, and this word, “cater,” it made me laugh.

Sometimes a poet can tell when a word is not a speaker’s own.

So that I could stop obsessing about this very possibility, I had practiced a response to yelling, and though I surprised myself by responding in exactly this practiced way of course nothing changed.

Language can be about force instead of relation.

When an experience is not really “about you” you can still be there, experiencing it.

“There are only two kinds of people,” he said, so loudly.

Maybe he’s right: maybe there are those who are violent, or who could be, and those who aren’t.

But the watermelon I bring home is yellow on the inside, and the melon my mother takes from the bin of smooth-rind honeydew is a cantaloupe.

This is not about fruit.

A poet is not inherently good.

It’s about how, at the end of the violence, I still want to know—what did it matter to him?"

For all de bread-fruit dem be’n done,

For, Lard! de groun’ was pure white-marl;
An’ t’rough de rain part o’ de year

But trouble me wid you’ jam fas’;
But wait, me frien’, you’ day wi’ come,
I’ll see you go same lak a some.

Canto for the Chestnut-Eared Laughingthrush,"And then rushed into the embrace of the mountains
Of the Kontum Plateau, ferried through Lo Xo pass,
Blew past Măng Đen, dizzied among hairpin turns,
Floating in the lushness 1,200 m above sea level,
Amid a mosaic of prime evergreen, gasping.
And up there we saw: strata of emerald forms,
Of beech, laurel, magnolia, heather, and myrtle.
Under unbroken canopy, in the undergrowth
Of that species rich upper montane wet forest,
Hidden somewhere in that mystery must be
Our very own Chestnut-eared Laughingthrush.
Garrulax konkakinhensis was our day’s journey
And query, who appeared in our dreams calling.
So we began our search, checked known locations.
At the first spot, magpies. The next: babblers.
But we kept looking, listening, knowing the forest
Gives up its secrets slowly. And passion we knew
From experience associates with wild patience.
On our lips the other name, Khướu Kon Ka Kinh,
For the shy terrestrial bird who has no need for names,
But sustenance and song. Then came a rasping buzz.
Close by us, there in the undergrowth, a voice
Signed among the trees. A few turns of the
Kaleidoscope, new shapes and colors rearranged
Themselves into the winged creature we sought out:
Brown and black dappled, spotted, and speckled,
The chestnut patch brushed behind the knowing eye,  
Blurring well into the daylight world of shadows.
As if a slight breeze stirred, gentle movements
Among the leaves and branches told us our bird
Retreated out of sight. We all breathed again.
The laughingthrush exists. The mountain forest exists.
This was only prelude, for we struck deeper into
The interior seeking greater clarity, closer listening.
And so we stood like trees staring back into the trees,
Ears peering through the green abundance,
Touching the colorful cacophony of sounds.
Reader, desire follows you into the field,
Where what you want colors what you see.
On the road back to Pleiku, looking out across
The highlands that held us, we all smiled—
There was no need for words. Each replayed
In their mind’s eye the day’s loveliness.
Then came news of extinction. The Javan rhino
Dead, the last of his kind found slaughtered
At Cát Tiên, horn sawed off. Joy fell from the sky.
Let us not tell our children a story that begins,
Once in the forests there was a laughingthrush . . .
We had met with Chestnut-eared Laughingthrush
Again and again, there in the heart of the heart
Of the forest, there where our fellow humans
Had not cleared, hunted, trapped, and defoliated
Life out of existence. There sweet thrush-like notes
May stream yet as water over rows of stones.
Others there sang the songs of their species too.
And our bodies also lighter with laughter."
Taken Aback,"Let me go, Joe, for I want go home:
   Can’t stan’ wid you,

The Weather-Cock Points South,"I put your leaves aside,
One by one:
The stiff, broad outer leaves;
The smaller ones,
Pleasant to touch, veined with purple;
The glazed inner leaves.
One by one
I parted you from your leaves,
Until you stood up like a white flower
Swaying slightly in the evening wind.
White flower,
Flower of wax, of jade, of unstreaked agate;
Flower with surfaces of ice,
With shadows faintly crimson.
Where in all the garden is there such a flower?
The stars crowd through the lilac leaves
To look at you.
The low moon brightens you with silver.
The bud is more than the calyx.
There is nothing to equal a white bud,
Of no colour, and of all,
Burnished by moonlight,
Thrust upon by a softly-swinging wind."
Heart-Stirrings,"You axe me as de bell begin fe ’trike,

Dat Dirty Rum,"If you must drink it, do no come

Dat ugly stain of drink, my frien’,

An’ mek you fool ’mongst better men
   When your brain’s in a whirl.
You may smoke just a bit indeed,

Aldough I do not use de weed,

But wait until you’re growin’ old

An’ feel your blood a-gettin’ cold

An’ you’ll give way to better men,

Old England,"I’ve a longin’ in me dept’s of heart dat I can conquer not,
’Tis a wish dat I’ve been havin’ from since I could form a t’o’t,
’Tis to sail athwart the ocean an’ to hear de billows roar,
When dem ride aroun’ de steamer, when dem beat on England’s shore.
Just to view de homeland England, in de streets of London walk,
An’ to see de famous sights dem ’bouten which dere’s so much talk,
An’ to watch de fact’ry chimneys pourin’ smoke up to de sky,
An’ to see de matches-children, dat I hear ’bout, passin’ by.
I would see Saint Paul’s Cathedral, an’ would hear some of de great
Learnin’ comin’ from de bishops, preachin’ relics of old fait’;
I would ope me mount’ wid wonder at de massive organ soun’,
An’ would ’train me eyes to see de beauty lyin’ all aroun’.
I’d go to de City Temple, where de old fait’ is a wreck,
An’ de parson is a-preachin’ views dat most folks will not tek;
I’d go where de men of science meet togeder in deir hall,
To give light unto de real truths, to obey king Reason’s call.
I would view Westminster Abbey, where de great of England sleep,
An’ de solemn marble statues o’er deir ashes vigil keep;
I would see immortal Milton an’ de wul’-famous Shakespeare,
Past’ral Wordswort’, gentle Gray, an’ all de great souls buried dere.
I would see de ancient chair where England’s kings deir crowns put on,
Soon to lay dem by again when all de vanity is done;
An’ I’d go to view de lone spot where in peaceful solitude
Rests de body of our Missis Queen, Victoria de Good.
An’ dese places dat I sing of now shall afterwards impart
All deir solemn sacred beauty to a weary searchin’ heart;
So I’ll rest glad an’ contented in me min’ for evermore,
When I sail across de ocean back to my own native shore."
"The Pleasures of Imagination, Book the Third","     What wonder therefore, since th’indearing
Of passion link the universal kind        (ties
Of man so close, what wonder if to search
This common nature thro’ the various change
Of sex, and age, and fortune, and the frame
Of each peculiar, draw the busy mind
With unresisted charms? The spacious west,
And all the teeming regions of the south
Hold not a quarry, to the curious flight
Of knowledge, half so tempting or so fair,
As man to man. Nor only where the smiles
Of love invite; nor only where th’ applause
Of cordial honour turns th’ attentive eye
On virtue’s graceful deeds. For since the course
Of things external acts in different ways
On human apprehensions, as the hand
Of nature temper’d to a different frame
Peculiar minds; so haply where the pow’rs
Of fancy neither lessen nor enlarge
The images of things, but paint in all
Their genuine hues, the features which they wore
In nature; there opinion will be true,
And action right. For action treads the path
In which opinion says he follows good,
Or flies from evil; and opinion gives
Report of good or evil, as the scene
Was drawn by fancy, lovely or deform’d:
Thus her report can never there be true,
Where fancy cheats the intellectual eye,
With glaring colours and distorted lines.
Is there a man, who at the sound of death,
Sees ghastly shapes of terror conjur’d up,
And black before him; nought but death-bed groans,
And fearful pray’rs, and plunging from the brink
Of light and being, down the gloomy air,
An unknown depth? Alas! in such a mind,
If no bright forms of excellence attend
The image of his country; nor the pomp
Of sacred senates, nor the guardian voice
Of justice on her throne, nor aught that wakes
The conscious bosom with a patriot’s flame;
Will not opinion tell him, that to die,
Or stand the hazard, is a greater ill
Than to betray his country? And in act
Will he not chuse to be a wretch and live?
Here vice begins then. From th’ inchanting cup
Which fancy holds to all, th’ unwary thirst
Of youth oft swallows a Circaean draught,
That sheds a baleful tincture o’er the eye
Of reason, till no longer he discerns,
And only guides to err. Then revel forth
A furious band that spurn him from the throne;
And all is uproar. Thus ambition grasps
The empire of the soul: thus pale revenge
Unsheaths her murd’rous dagger; and the hands
Of lust and rapine, with unholy arts,
Watch to o’erturn the barrier of the laws
That keeps them from their prey: thus all the plagues
The wicked bear, or o’er the trembling scene
The tragic muse discloses, under shapes
Of honour, safety, pleasure, ease or pomp,
Stole first into the mind. Yet not by all
Those lying forms which fancy in the brain
Engenders, are the kindling passions driv’n
To guilty deeds; nor reason bound in chains,
That vice alone may lord it: oft adorn’d
With solemn pageants, folly mounts his throne,
And plays her ideot-anticks, like a queen.
A thousand garbs she wears; a thousand ways
She wheels her giddy empire. — Lo! thus far
With bold adventure, to the Mantuan lyre
I sing of nature’s charms, and touch well-pleas’d
A stricter note: now haply must my song
Unbend her serious measure, and reveal
In lighter strains, how folly’s aukward arts
Excite impetuous laughter’s gay rebuke;
The sportive province of the comic muse.
      See! in what crouds the uncouth forms advance,
Each would outstrip the other, each prevent
Our careful search, and offer to your gaze,
Unask’d, his motley features. Wait awhile,
My curious friends! and let us first arrange
In proper orders your promiscuous throng.
     Behold the foremost band; of slender thought,
And easy faith; whom flatt’ring fancy sooths
With lying spectres, in themselves to view
Illustrious forms of excellence and good,
That scorn the mansion. With exulting hearts
They spread their spurious treasures to the sun;
And bid the world admire! but chief the glance
Of wishful envy draws their joy-bright eyes,
And lists with self-applause each lordly brow.
In number boundless as the blooms of spring,
Behold their glaring idols, empty shades
By fancy gilded o’er, and then set up
For adoration. Some in learning’s garb,
With formal band and sable-cinctur’d gown,
And rags of mouldy volumes. Some elate
With martial splendour, steely pikes, and swords
Of costly frame, and gay Phoenician robes
Inwrought with flow’ring gold, assume the port
Of stately valour: list’ning by his side
There stands a female form; to her, with looks
Of earnest import, pregnant with amaze,
He talks of deadly deeds, of breaches, storms,
And sulph’rous mines, and ambush: then at once
Breaks off, and smiles to see her look so pale,
And asks some wond’ring question of her fears.
Others of graver mien; behold, adorn’d
With holy ensigns, how sublime they move,
And bending oft their sanctimonious eyes,
Take homage of the simple-minded throng;
Ambassadors of heav’n! Nor much unlike
Is he whose visage, in the lazy mist
That mantles every feature, hides a brood
Of politic conceits; of whispers, nods,
And hints deep-omen’d with unwieldy schemes,
And dark portents of state. Ten thousand more,
Prodigious habits and tumultuous tongues,
Pour dauntless in and swell the boastful band.
     Then comes the second order; all who seek
The debt of praise, where watchful unbelief
Darts thro’ the thin pretence her squinting eye
On some retir’d appearance which belies
The boasted virtue, or annulls th’ applause
That justice else would pay. Here side by side
I see two leaders of the solemn train,
Approaching: one a female, old and grey,
With eyes demure and wrinkle-furrow’d brow,
Pale as the cheeks of death; yet still she stuns
The sickning audience with a nauseous tale;
How many youths her myrtle chains have worn,
How many virgins at her triumphs pin’d!
Yet how resolv’d she guards her cautious heart;
Such is her terror at the risques of love,
And man’s seducing tongue! The other seems
A bearded sage, ungentle in his mien,
And sordid all his habit; peevish want
Grins at his heels, while down the gazing throng
He stalks, resounding in magnific phrase
The vanity of riches, the contempt
Of pomp and pow’r. Be prudent in your zeal,
Ye grave associates! let the silent grace
Of her who blushes at the fond regard
Her charms inspire, more eloquent unfold
The praise of spotless honour: let the man
Whose eye regards not his illustrious pomp
And ample store, but as indulgent streams
To chear the barren soil and spread the fruits
Of joy, let him by juster measure fix
The price of riches and the end of pow’r.
     Another tribe succeeds; deluded long
By fancy’s dazzling optics, these behold
The images of some peculiar things
With brighter hues resplendent, and portray’d
With features nobler far than e’er adorn’d
Their genuine objects. Hence the fever’d heart
Pants with delirious hope for tinsel charms;
Hence oft obtrusive on the eye of scorn,
Untimely zeal her witless pride betrays;
And serious manhood, from the tow’ring aim
Of wisdom, stoops to emulate the boast
Of childish toil. Behold yon mystic form,
Bedeck’d with feathers, insects, weeds and shells!
Not with intenser brow the Samian sage
Bent his fix’d eye on heav’n’s eternal fires,
When first the order of that radiant scene
Swell’d his exulting thought, than this surveys
A muckworm’s entrails or a spider’s fang.
Next him a youth, with flow’rs and myrtles crown’d,
Attends that virgin form, and blushing kneels,
With fondest gesture and a suppliant’s tongue,
To win her coy regard: adieu, for him,
The dull ingagements of the bustling world!
Adieu the sick impertinence of praise!
And hope, and action! for with her alone,
By streams and shades, to steal the sighing hours,
Is all he asks, and all that fate can give!
Thee too, facetious Momion, wandring here,
Thee, dreaded censor! oft have I beheld
Bewilder’d unawares: alas! too long
Flush’d with thy comic triumphs and the spoils
Of sly derision! till on every side
Hurling thy random bolts, offended truth
Assign'd thee here thy station with the slaves
Of folly. Thy once formidable name
Shall grace her humble records, and be heard
In scoffs and mock’ry bandied from the lips
Of all the vengeful brotherhood around,
So oft the patient victims of thy scorn.
     But now, ye gay! to whom indulgent fate,
Of all the muse’s empire hath assign’d
The fields of folly, hither each advance
Your sickles; here the teeming soil affords
Its richest growth. A fav’rite brood appears;
In whom the daemon, with a mother’s joy,
Views all her charms reflected, all her cares
At full repay’d. Ye most illustrious band!
Who scorning reason‘s tame, pedantic rules,
And order’s vulgar bondage, never meant
For souls sublime as yours, with generous zeal
Pay vice the rev’rence virtue long usurp’d,
And yield deformity the fond applause
Which beauty wont to claim; forgive my song,
That for the blushing diffidence of youth,
It shuns the unequal province of your praise.
     Thus far triumphant in the pleasing guile
Of bland imagination, folly’s train
Have dar’d our search: but now a dastard-kind
Advance reluctant, and with fault’ring feet
Shrink from the gazer’s eye: infeebled hearts,
Whom fancy chills with visionary fears,
Or bends to servile tameness with conceits
Of shame, of evil, or of base defect,
Fantastic and delusive. Here the slave
Who droops abash’d when sullen pomp surveys
His humbler habit: here the trembling wretch
Unnerv’d and froze with terror’s icy bolts
Spent in weak wailings, drown’d in shameful tears,
At every dream of danger: here subdued
By frontless laughter and the hardy scorn
Of old, unfeeling vice, the abject soul
Who blushing half resigns the candid praise
Of temperance and honour; half disowns
A freeman’s hatred of tyrannic pride;
And hears with sickly smiles the venal mouth
With foulest licence mock the patriot’s name.
     Last of the motley bands on whom the pow‘r
Of gay derision bends her hostile aim,
Is that where shameful ignorance presides.
Beneath her sordid banners, lo! they march,
Like blind and lame. Whate’er their doubtful hands
Attempt, confusion strait appears behind,
And troubles all the work. Thro’ many a maze,
Perplex’d they struggle, changing every path,
O’erturning every purpose; then at last
Sit down dismay’d, and leave th’entangled scene
For scorn to sport with. Such then is th’abode
Of folly in the mind; and such the shapes
In which she governs her obsequious train.
Tho’ every scene of ridicule in things
To lead the tenour of my devious lay;
Thro’ every swift occasion, which the hand
Of laughter points at, when the mirthful sting
Distends her sallying nerves and choaks her tongue;
What were it but to count each crystal drop
Which morning’s dewy fingers on the blooms
Of May distill? Suffice it to have said,
Where’er the pow’r of ridicule displays
Her quaint-ey’d visage, some incongruous form,
Some stubborn dissonance of things combin’d,
Strikes on the quick observer: whether pomp,
Or praise, or beauty mix their partial claim
Where sordid fashions, where ignoble deeds,
Where foul deformity are wont to dwell,
Or whether these with violation loath’d,
Invade resplendent pomp’s imperious mien,
The charms of beauty, or the boast of praise.
     Ask we for what fair end, th’ almighty sire
In mortal bosoms wakes this gay contempt,
These grateful stings of laughter, from disgust
Educing pleasure? Wherefore, but to aid
The tardy steps of reason, and at once
By this prompt impulse urge us to depress
The giddy aims of folly? Tho’ the light
Of truth slow-dawning on th’ inquiring mind,
At length unfolds, thro’ many a subtile tie,
How these uncouth disorders end at last
In public evil; yet benignant heav’n
Conscious how dim the dawn of truth appears
To thousands; conscious what a scanty pause
From labours and from care, the wider lot
Of humble life affords for studious thought
To scan the maze of nature; therefore stampt
The glaring scenes with characters of scorn,
As broad, as obvious to the passing clown,
As to the letter’d sage’s curious eye.
     Such are the various aspects of the mind —
Some heav’nly genius, whose unclouded thoughts
Attain that secret harmony which blends
Th’ aethereal spirit with its mold of clay;
O! teach me to reveal the grateful charm
That searchless nature o’er the sense of man
Diffuses, to behold, in lifeless things,
The inexpressive semblance of himself,
Of thought and passion. Mark the sable woods
That shade sublime yon mountain’s nodding brow;
With what religious awe the solemn scene
Commands your steps! as if the reverend form
Of Minos or of Numa should forsake
Th’ Elysian seats, and down th’ imbow’ring glade
Move to your pausing eye! Behold th’ expanse
Of yon gay landscape, where the silver clouds
Flit o’er the heav’ns before the sprightly breeze:
Now their grey cincture skirts the doubtful sun;
Now streams of splendor, thro’ their opening veil
Effulgent, sweep from off the gilded lawn
Th’ aerial shadows; on the curling brook,
And on the shady margin’s quiv’ring leaves
With quickest lustre glancing: while you view
The prospect, say, within your chearful breast
Plays not the lively sense of winning mirth
With clouds and sunshine chequer’d, while the round
Of social converse, to th’ inspiring tongue
Of some gay nymph amid her subject-train,
Moves all obsequious? Whence is this effect,
This kindred pow’r of such discordant things?
Or flows their semblance from that mystic tone
To which the new-born mind’s harmonious pow’rs
At first were strung? Or rather from the links
Which artful custom twines around her frame?
     For when the diff’rent images of things
By chance combin’d, have struck th’ attentive soul
With deeper impulse, or connected long,
Have drawn her frequent eye; howe’er distinct
Th’ external scenes, yet oft th’ ideas gain
From that conjunction an eternal tie,
And sympathy unbroken. Let the mind
Recall one partner of the various league,
Immediate, lo! the firm confed’rates rise,
And each his former station strait resumes:
One movement governs the consenting throng,
And all at once with rosy pleasure shine,
Or all are sadden’d with the glooms of care.
’Twas thus, if ancient fame the truth unfold,
Two faithful needles, from th’ informing touch
Of the same parent-stone, together drew
Its mystic virtue, and at first conspir’d
With fatal impulse quiv’ring to the pole;
Then, tho’ disjoin’d by kingdoms, tho’ the main
Rowl’d its broad surge betwixt, and diff’rent stars
Beheld their wakeful motions, yet preserv’d
The former friendship, and remember’d still
Th’ alliance of their birth: whate’er the line
Which one possess’d, nor pause, nor quiet knew
The sure associate, ere with trembling speed
He found its path and fix’d unerring there.
Such is the secret union, when we feel
A song, a flow’r, a name at once restore
Those long-connected scenes where first they mov’d
Th’ attention; backward thro’ her mazy walks
Guiding the wanton fancy to her scope,
To temples, courts or fields; with all the band
Of painted forms, of passions and designs
Attendant: whence, if pleasing in itself,
The prospect from that sweet accession gains
Redoubled influence o’er the list’ning mind.

     By these mysterious ties the busy pow’r
Of mem’ry her ideal train preserves
Intire; or when they would elude her watch,
Reclaims their fleeting footsteps from the waste
Of dark oblivion; thus collecting all
The various forms of being to present,
Before the curious aim of mimic art,
Their largest choice: like spring’s unfolded blooms
Exhaling sweetness, that the skillful bee
May taste at will, from their selected spoils
To work her dulcet food. For not th’ expanse
Of living lakes in summer’s noontide calm,
Reflects the bord’ring shade and sun-bright heav’ns
With fairer semblance; not the sculptur’d gold
More faithful keeps the graver’s lively trace,
Than he whose birth the sister-pow’rs of art
Propitious view’d, and from his genial star
Shed influence to the seeds of fancy kind;
Than his attemper’d bosom must preserve
The seal of nature. There alone unchang’d,
Her form remains. The balmy walks of May
There breathe perennial sweets: the trembling chord
Resounds for ever in th’ abstracted ear,
Melodious; and the virgin’s radiant eye,
Superior to disease, to grief, and time,
Shines with unbating lustre. Thus at length
Indow’d with all that nature can bestow,
The child of fancy oft in silence bends
O’er these mix’d treasures of his pregnant breast,
With conscious pride. From them he oft resolves
To frame he knows not what excelling things;
And win he knows not what sublime reward
Of praise and wonder. By degrees the mind
Feels her young nerves dilate: the plastic pow’rs
Labour for action: blind emotions heave
His bosom; and with loveliest frenzy caught,
From earth to heav’n he rolls his daring eye,
From heav’n to earth. Anon ten thousand shapes,
Like spectres trooping to the wisard’s call,
Fleet swift before him. From the womb of earth
From ocean’s bed they come: th’ eternal heav’ns
Disclose their splendors, and the dark abyss
Pours out her births unknown. With fixed gaze
He marks the rising phantoms. Now compares
Their diff’rent forms; now blends them, now divides;
Inlarges and extenuates by turns;
Opposes, ranges in fantastic bands,
And infinitely varies. Hither now,
Now thither fluctuates his inconstant aim,
With endless choice perplex’d. At length his plan
Begins to open. Lucid order dawns;
And as from Chaos old the jarring seeds
Of nature at the voice divine repair’d
Each to its place, till rosy earth unveil’d
Her fragrant bosom, and the joyful sun
Sprung up the blue serene; by swift degrees
Thus disentangled, his entire design
Emerges. Colours mingle, features join,
And lines converge: the fainter parts retire;
The fairer eminent in light advance;
And every image on its neighbour smiles.
A while he stands, and with a father’s joy
Contemplates. Then with Promethéan art,
Into its proper vehicle he breathes
The fair conception; which imbodied thus,
And permanent, becomes to eyes or ears
An object ascertain’d: while thus inform’d,
The various organs of his mimic skill,
The consonance of sounds, the featur’d rock,
The shadowy picture and impassion’d verse,
Beyond their proper pow’rs attract the soul
By that expressive semblance, while in sight
Of nature’s great original we scan
The lively child of art; while line by line,
And feature after feature we refer
To that sublime exemplar whence it stole
Those animating charms. Thus beauty’s palm
Betwixt ’em wav’ring hangs: applauding love
Doubts where to chuse; and mortal man aspires
To tempt creative praise. As when a cloud
Of gath’ring hail with limpid crusts of ice
Inclos’d and obvious to the beaming sun,
Collects his large effulgence; strait the heav’ns
With equal flames present on either hand
The radiant visage: Persia stands at gaze,
Appall’d; and on the brink of Ganges waits
The snowy-vested seer, in Mithra’s name,
To which the fragrance of the south shall burn,
To which his warbled orisons ascend.
     Such various bliss the well-tun’d heart injoys,
Favour’d of heav’n! While plung’d in sordid cares,
Th’ unfeeling vulgar mocks the boon divine:
And harsh austerity, from whose rebuke
Young love and smiling wonder shrink away,
Abash’d and chill of heart, with sager frowns
Condemns the fair inchantment. On, my strain,
Perhaps ev’n now some cold, fastidious judge
Casts a disdainful eye; and calls my toil,
And calls the love and beauty which I sing,
The dream of folly. Thou grave censor! say,
Is beauty then a dream, because the glooms
Of dullness hang too heavy on thy sense
To let her shine upon thee? So the man
Whose eye ne’er open’d on the light of heav’n,
Might smile with scorn while raptur’d vision tells
Of the gay, colour’d radiance flushing bright
O’er all creation. From the wise be far
Such gross, unhallow’d pride; nor needs my song
Descend so low; but rather now unfold,
If human thought could reach, or words unfold,
By what mysterious fabric of the mind,
The deep-felt joys and harmony of sound
Result from airy motion; and from shape
The lovely phantoms of sublime and fair.
By what fine ties hath GOD connected things
When present in the mind; which in themselves
Have no connection? Sure the rising sun,
O’er the caerulean convex of the sea,
With equal brightness and with equal warmth
Might rowl his fiery orb; nor yet the soul
Thus feel her frame expanded, and her pow’rs
Exulting in the splendor she beholds;
Like a young conqu’ror moving thro’ the pomp
Of some triumphal day. When join’d at eve,
Soft-murm’ring streams and gales of gentlest breath
Melodious Philomela’s wakeful strain
Attemper, could not man’s discerning ear
Thro’ all its tones the symphony pursue;
Nor yet this breath divine of nameless joy
Steal thro’ his veins and fan th’awaken’d heart,
Mild as the breeze, yet rapt’rous as the song?
     But were not nature still indow’d at large
With all which life requires, tho’ unadorn’d
With such inchantment? Wherefore then her form
So exquisitely fair? her breath perfum’d
With such aethereal sweetness? Whence her voice
Inform’d at will to raise or to depress
Th’ impassion’d soul? and whence the robes of light
Which thus invest her with more lovely pomp
Than fancy can describe? Whence but from thee,
O source divine of ever-flowing love,
And thy unmeasur‘d goodness? Not content
With every food of life to nourish man,
By kind illusions of the wond’ring sense
Thou mak’st all nature beauty to his eye,
Or music to his ear: well-pleas’d he scans
The goodly prospect; and with inward smiles
Treads the gay verdure of the painted plain;
Beholds the azure canopy of heav’n,
And living lamps that over-arch his head
With more than regal splendor; bends his ears
To the full choir of water, air, and earth;
Nor heeds the pleasing error of his thought,
Nor doubts the painted green or azure arch,
Nor questions more the music’s mingling sounds
Than space, or motion, or eternal time:
So sweet he feels their influence to attract
The fixed soul; to brighten the dull glooms
Of care, and make the destin’d road of life
Delightful to his feet. So fables tell,
Th‘ advent’rous heroe, bound on hard exploits,
Beholds with glad surprize, by secret spells
Of some kind sage, the patron of his toils,
A visionary paradise disclos’d
Amid the dubious wild: with streams, and shades,
And airy songs, th’ enchanted landscape smiles,
Chears his long labours and renews his frame.
     What then is taste, but these internal pow’rs
Active, and strong, and feelingly alive
To each fine impulse? a discerning sense
Of decent and sublime, with quick disgust
From things deform’d, or disarrang’d, or gross
In species? This, nor gems, nor stores of gold,
Nor purple state, nor culture can bestow;
But GOD alone, when first his active hand
Imprints the secret byass of the soul.
He, mighty parent! wise and just in all,
Free as the vital breeze or light of heav’n,
Reveals the charms of nature. Ask the swain
Who journeys homeward from a summer day’s
Long labour, why, forgetful of his toils
And due repose, he loiters to behold
The sunshine gleaming as thro’ amber clouds,
O’er all the western sky; full soon, I ween,
His rude expression and untutor’d airs,
Beyond the pow’r of language, will unfold
The form of beauty smiling at his heart,
How lovely! how commanding! But tho’ heav’n
In every breast hath sown these early seeds
Of love and admiration, yet in vain,
Without fair culture’s kind parental aid,
Without inlivening suns, and genial show’rs,
And shelter from the blast, in vain we hope
The tender plant should rear its blooming head,
Or yield the harvest promis’d in its spring.
Nor yet will every soil with equal stores
Repay the tiller’s labour; or attend
His will, obsequious, whether to produce
The olive or the laurel. Diff’rent minds
Incline to different objects: one pursues
The vast alone, the wonderful, the wild;
Another sighs for harmony, and grace,
And gentlest beauty. Hence when lightning fires
The arch of heav’n, and thunders rock the ground;
When furious whirlwinds rend the howling air,
And ocean, groaning from the lowest bed,
Heaves his tempestuous billows to the sky;
Amid the mighty uproar, while below
The nations tremble, Shakespear looks abroad
From some high cliff, superior, and enjoys
The elemental war. But Waller longs,
All on the margin of some flow’ry stream
To spread his careless limbs amid the cool
Of plantane shades, and to the list’ning deer,
The tale of slighted vows and love’s disdain
Resound soft-warbling all the live-long day:
Consenting Zephyr sighs; the weeping rill
Joins in his plaint, melodious; mute the groves;
And hill and dale with all their echoes mourn.
Such and so various are the tastes of men.
     Oh! blest of heav’n, whom not the languid songs
Of luxury, the Siren! not the bribes
Of sordid wealth, nor all the gaudy spoils
Of pageant honour can seduce to leave
Those ever-blooming sweets, which from the store
Of nature fair imagination culls
To charm th’ inliven’d soul! What tho’ not all
Of mortal offspring can attain the heights
Of envied life; tho’ only few possess
Patrician treasures or imperial state;
Yet nature’s care, to all her children just,
With richer treasures and an ampler state
Indows at large whatever happy man
Will deign to use them. His the city’s pomp,
The rural honours his. Whate’er adorns
The princely dome, the column and the arch,
The breathing marbles and the sculptur’d gold,
Beyond the proud possessor’s narrow claim,
His tuneful breast injoys. For him, the spring
Distills her dews, and from the silken gem
Its lucid leaves unfolds: for him, the hand
Of autumn tinges every fertile branch
With blooming gold and blushes like the morn.
Each passing hour sheds tribute from her wings;
And still new beauties meet his lonely walk;
And loves unfelt attract him. Not a breeze
Flies o’er the meadow, not a cloud imbibes
The setting sun’s effulgence, not a strain
From all the tenants of the warbling shade
Ascends, but whence his bosom can partake
Fresh pleasure, unreprov’d. Nor thence partakes
Fresh pleasure only: for th’ attentive mind,
By this harmonious action on her pow’rs,
Becomes herself harmonious: wont so long
In outward things to meditate the charm
Of sacred order, soon she seeks at home
To find a kindred order, to exert
Within herself this elegance of love,
This fair-inspir’d delight: her temper’d pow’rs
Refine at length, and every passion wears
A chaster, milder, more attractive mien.
But if to ampler prospects, if to gaze
On nature’s form where negligent of all
These lesser graces, she assumes the port
Of that eternal majesty that weigh’d
The world’s foundations, if to these the mind
Exalt her daring eye; then mightier far
Will be the change, and nobler. Would the forms
Of servile custom cramp her generous pow’rs?
Would sordid policies, the barb’rous growth
Of ignorance and rapine, bow her down
To tame pursuits, to indolence and fear?
Lo! she appeals to nature, to the winds
And rowling waves, the sun’s unwearied course,
The elements and seasons: all declare
For what th’ eternal maker has ordain’d
The pow’rs of man: we feel within ourselves
His energy divine: he tells the heart,
He meant, he made us to behold and love
What he beholds and loves, the general orb
Of life and being; to be great like him,
Beneficent and active. Thus the men
Whom nature’s works can charm, with GOD himself
Hold converse; grow familiar, day by day,
With his conceptions; act upon his plan;
And form to his, the relish of their souls."
Pedantic Literalist,"Prince Rupert's drop, paper muslin ghost,
    White torch— “with power to say unkind
Things with kindness, and the most
        Irritating things in the midst of love and
             Tears,” you invite destruction.
You are like the meditative man
    With the perfunctory heart; its
Carved cordiality ran
To and fro at first like an inlaid and royal
             Immutable production;
Then afterward “neglected to be
    Painful, deluding him with
Loitering formality,”
        “Doing its duty as if it did it not,”
             Presenting an obstruction
To the motive that it served. What stood
    Erect in you has withered. A
Little “palm-tree of turned wood”
        Informs your once spontaneous core in its
             Immutable production."

Strokes of the Tamarind Switch,"I dared not look at him, 
My eyes with tears were dim, 
   My spirit filled with hate
     Of man’s depravity, 
I hurried through the gate. 

I went but I returned, 
While in my bosom turned 
   The monstrous wrong that we 
       Oft bring upon ourselves, 
And yet we cannot see. 

Poor little erring wretch!
The cutting tamarind switch
   Had left its bloody mark,
      And on his legs were streaks. 
   That looked like boiling bark. 

I spoke to him the while: 
At first he tried to smile, 
   But the long pent-up tears
      Came gushing in a flood; 
   He was but of tender years. 

With eyes bloodshot and red, 
He told me of a father dead 
   And lads like himself rude, 
     Who goaded him to wrong:
    He for the future promised to be good. 

The mother yesterday 
Said she was sending him away, 
   Away across the seas:
      She told of futile prayers
   Said on her wearied knees. 

I wished the lad good-bye, 
And left him with a sigh:
   Again I heard him talk—
      His limbs, he said, were sore, 
   He could not walk. 

I ’member when a smaller boy, 
A mother’s pride, a mother’s joy, 
    I too was very rude:
        They beat me too, though not the same,  
    And has it done me good? "
De Days Dat Are Gone,"I T’ink of childhood days again,
      An’ wish dat I was free
To res’ me baby head once more
      Upon me mudder’s knee:
If we had power to change dis life
      An’ live it back again,
We would be children all de time
      Nor fret at childhood’s pain.
I look on my school life of old,
      Dem sweet days dat are pas’,
An’ wonder how I’d wish to see
      Those dear times en’ at las’:
It was because I was a boy,
      An’ knew not what b’en good;
All time I tas’e de supple-jack,
      Bein’ I was so rude.
An’ o’ de marnings when I woke,
      ’Fo’ you can see you’ han’,
I mek me way on to de spring
      Fe full me bucket-pan:
I t’ought ofttimes dat it was hard
      For me to wake so soon;
Dere was no star fe light de way,
      Much more de white roun’ moon.
Still, childhood pain could neber las’,
      An’ i remember yet
De many sorrows ’cross me pat’
      Dat neber mek me fret:
But now me joys are only few,
      I live because I’m boun’,
An’ try fe mek my life of use

My Pretty Dan,"I have a póliceman down at de Bay, 
An’ he is true to me though far away.

I love my pólice, and he loves me too, 
An’ he has promised he’ll be ever true. 

My little bobby is a darlin’ one, 
An’ he’s de prettiest you could set eyes ’pon. 

When he be’n station’ up de countryside, 
Fus’ time I shun him sake o’ foolish pride. 

But as I watched him patrolling his beat, 
I got to find out he was nice an’ neat. 

More still I foun’ out he was extra kin’,
An’ dat his precious heart was wholly mine. 

Den I became his own a true sweetheart, 
An’ while life last we’re hopin’ not fe part. 

He wears a truncheon an’ a handcuff case, 
An’ pretty cap to match his pretty face. 

Dear lilly p’liceman stationed down de sout’,

I could not give against a póliceman; 
For if I do, how could I lub my Dan? 

Prettiest of naygar is my dear police,

An’ he is true to me though far away. "
Like a Bulrush,"Or the spike
of a channel marker or the
moon, he superintended the demolition of his image in
the water by the wind; he did not strike
 
them at the
time as being different from
any other inhabitant of the water; it was as if he
were a seal in the combined livery
 
of bird plus
snake; it was as if he knew that
the penguins were not fish and as if in their bat blindness, they did not
realize that he was amphibious."
To Military Progress,"You use your mind
Like a millstone to grind

As its god imparts,
     Calls
And claps its wings
Till the tumult brings

When You Want a Bellyful,"When you want a bellyful,

To Inspector W. E. Clark,"Farewell, dear Sir, a sad farewell! 
An’ as across the deep you sail, 
   Bon voyage we wish you:
We love you deepest as we can, 
As officer an’ gentleman, 
  With love sincere an’ true. 
Though often you have been our judge, 
We never owed you one lee grudge,
  For you were always fair: 
So, as the sad farewell we say, 
May Neptune guide you, Sir, we pray
  With ever watchful care. 
But as you travel to our home, 
Sad are the strange thoughts which will come, 
   Bringin’ an aching pain; 
That as this is a fitful life, 
With disappointments ever rife, 
   We may not meet again. 
Yet while our hearts are filled with grief, 
The god of hope brings sweet relief
  An’ bids us not despair: 
Of all our thoughts we cannot tell, 
But wish you, Sir, a fond farewell, 
   A farewell of good cheer.

Nellie White,"(an answer to the foregoing)
Sweetheart, I have loved you well,

An’ you need not hab no fear,
For I’ll marry you, my dear.

Don’t say that I’ll play you out;

Cry not, except ’tis for joy;
Can’t you trus’ dis big-heart boy?

Tek my heart, an’ go to sleep.
How could I deceive you, Nell?
Don’t I love you much too well?
Could I fool dat plump black cheek?
Don’t cry, darlin’—look up—speak!
Nellie of the pretty feet
An’ the palm-like shape so neat,
I have eyes to see but you;
Darling, trust me to be true!
Nell, me dear, you need not fret,
For you are my food, my breat’;
Trust me, trust me, Nellie White,
Kiss me, lee sweetheart—good-night!"
School-Teacher Nell’s Lub-Letter,"If you promise to lub me alway,
   I will foreber be true
An’ you don’t mek me sorry de day
   Dat I give myself to you.
How I ’member de night when we meet,
   An’ chat fe de first time of lub!
I go home, an’ den neber could eat
   None o’ de plateful o’ grub.
An’ de day it was empty to me,
   Wakin’, but dreamin’ of you,
While de school it was dull as could be,
   An’ me hate me wuk fe do.
Oh, I knew of your lub long before
   My school friends tell me of it,
And I watch at you from de school door,
   When you pass to de cockpit.
Den I hear too dat you use’ fe talk,
   Say, if you caan’ ketch me dark night,
You would sure ketch me as deh walk
   In a de open moonlight.
An’ you’ wud come to pass very soon,
   For scarcely a mont’ did gone
When de light of de star an’ de moon
   Shine bright as we kiss all alone.
I can neber remember de times
   Ma scolded her little Nell;
All day her tongue wuks like de chimes
   Dat come from de old school-bell.
I have given up school-life fe you:
   Sweetheart, my all is your own;
Den say you will ever be true,
   An’ live fe you’ Nellie alone."
Fetchin’ Water,"Watch how dem touris’ like fe look
   Out ’pon me little daughter,
Wheneber fe her tu’n to cook
   Or fetch a pan of water:
         De sight look gay;
         Dat is one way,
         But I can tell you say,
’Nuff rock’tone in de sea, yet none
But those ’pon lan’ know ’bouten sun.
De pickny comin’ up de hill,
   Fightin’ wid heavy gou’d,
Won’t say it sweet him, but he will
   Complain about de load:
         Him feel de weight,
         Dem watch him gait;
         It’s so some of de great
High people fabour t’ink it sweet
Fe batter in de boilin’ heat.
Dat boy wid de karásene pan,
   Sulky down to him toe,
His back was rollin’ in a san’,
   For him pa mek him crow:
         Him feel it bad,
         Near mek him mad,
         But teach him he’s a lad;
Go disobey him fader wud,
When he knows dat his back would sud!
But Sarah Jane she wus ’an all,
   For she t’row ’way de pan,
An’ jam her back agains’ de wall
   Fe fight her mumma Fan:
         Feelin’ de pinch,
         She mek a wrinch
         An’ get ’way; but de wench
Try fe put shame upon her ma,
Say dat she cook de bittle raw.
Dis water-fetchin’ sweet dem though
   When day mek up dem min’,
An’ ’nuff o’ dem ’tart out fe go,
   An’ de weader is fine:
         De pan might leak,
         Dem don’t a ’peak,
         Nor eben try fe seek
Some clay or so to mek it soun’;
Dem don’t care ef dem wet all roun’.
Dén all ’bout de road dem ’catter
   Marchin’ álong quite at ease;
Dat time listen to deir chatter.
   Talkin’ anyt’ing dem please:
         Dem don’t a fear,
         Neider a care,
         For who can interfere?
T’ree mile—five, six tu’n,—an’ neber
W’ary, but could do it for eber."
The Hermit,"Far in de country let me hide myself
From life’s sad pleasures an’ de greed of pelf,
Dwellin’ wid Nature primitive an’ rude,
Livin’ a peaceful life of solitude.
Dere by de woodland let me build my home
Where tropic roses ever are in bloom,
An’ t’rough de wild cane growin’ thick and tall
Rushes in gleeful mood de waterfall.
Roof strong enough to keep out season rain,
Under whose eaves loved swallows will be fain
To build deir nests, an’ deir young birdlings rear
Widouten have de least lee t’ought of fear.
An’ in my study I shall view we wul’,
An’ learn of all its doin’s to de full;
List to de woodland creatures’ music sweet—
Sad, yet contented in my lone retreat."
Out of Debt,"       De Christmas is finish’;
       It was rather skinnish,
Yet still we are happy, an’ so needn’ fret,
       For dinner is cookin’,
       An’ baby is lookin’
An’ laughin’; she knows dat her pa owe no debt.
       De pas’ hab de debtor,
       An’ we cannot get her
To com back an’ grin at us in time gone:
       Dere’s no wine fe breakfas’,
       An’ no one fe mek fuss,
We all is contented fe suck one dry bone.
       No two bit o’ brater
       Wid shopkeeper Marter,
I feel me head light sittin’ down by me wife;
       No weight lef’ behin’ me
       No gungu a line fe
De man who was usual to worry me life.
       We’re now out o’ season,
       But dat is no reason
Why we shan’t be happy wid heart free and light:
       We feel we are better
       Dan many dat fetter
Wid burden dey shoulder to mek Christmas bright.
       Some ’crape out de cupboard,
       Not ’memberin’ no wud
Dat say about fégettin’ when rainy day:
       It comes widout warning
       ’Fo’ daylight a marnin’,
An’, wakin’, de blue cloud ta’n black dat was gay.
       De days dat gwin’ follow
       No more will be hollow,
Like some dat come after de Christmas before:
       We’ll lay by some money
       An’ lick at de honey,
An’ neber will need to lock up our front door.
       Jes’ look at de brightness
       Of dat poor an’ sightless
Old man on de barrel a playin’ de flute:
       Wha’ mek him so joyful?
       His lap is of toy full,
A pick’ninny play wid de patch on his suit.
       Ours too de same blessin’
       An’ we’ve learn’ a lesson
We should have been learnin’ from years long ago:
       A Christmas ’dout pleasure
       Gave dat darlin’ treasure,
An’ duty to Milly is all dat we owe."
