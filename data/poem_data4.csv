The Three Birds of the Milky Way,"On the cusp of winter, under the pollution
of a hunter’s moon, I see, for once, no bird,
but a cross; no wing but a brace to bear
what must be borne. Here: the queen on her throne,
the Summer Triangle, the wingtips
of the great swan charted in the sky.
The guide says there are three great birds of the Milky
Way, the Pathway of the Birds. I make note,
try to imagine what I might fashion
in the cold night, in this place I didn’t ask to inhabit.
How did I end up here? What wind blew me
off course, took me from heart and home? My
body falters, loses feather and beak
and bone, turns to dust or ice or stone."
"Self-Portrait as a Body, a Sea","I am a body schooling,
a ball of fish, flashing
and many, in these early days
of feeling, of love.
When I learned,
hours ago, of fish songs
that swell like birdsong
in the morning,
how they foghorn or buzz
for food, or mates
or space, I thought,
now aren’t I a humming thing?
Yes, you say,
a body of oceans
and marvelous.
And the sea anemone in me,
              growing on the wreckage
of an old ship—
              can they grow that way,
              I wonder, on an ending—
                          Still this bright and tentacled
anthozoan polyp,
              which reaches and filters
                                                            whatever it needs
                          from this strong current,
              and the current too that carries
                                                            the sea cucumbers,
              the rough mammals,
                          the life, both vertebrate
                                                            and invertebrate,
even the batfish,
                          the black jewfish,
              and the terapontid,
it all swells and breaks in me
like a chorus at dusk."
Brood,"My chest is earth

I meant to write my chest is warm
but earth will do
                                      to exhume a heart
      Beat
I meant to write
breathe
                        Did you know I was alive the whole time
I was alive in the ground but torpor
                    But torpor
Slowed beat
My chest filled like a jar with dirt
I mean
      dearth
For slow months at rest in the hole
I’d made in myself
                    A frozen ground
      A ground in thaw
I mean
                    Spring is coming
I mean
                I push the wet dirt with my mandible
I mean jaw
          Jaw
                    Y’all
I know I am not a nymph in exhumation
    but would you please explain
              this half-remembered light"
Changing Is Not Vanishing,"Who says the Indian race is vanishing?
The Indians will not vanish.
The feathers, paint and moccasin will vanish, but the Indians,—never!
Just as long as there is a drop of human blood in America, the Indians will not
       vanish.
His spirit is everywhere; the American Indian will not vanish.
He has changed externally but he has not vanished.
He is an industrial and commercial man, competing with the world; he has not
       vanished.
Wherever you see an Indian upholding the standard of his race, there you see
       the Indian man—he has not vanished.
The man part of the Indian is here, there and everywhere.
The Indian race vanishing? No, never! The race will live on and prosper forever."
The Lost Lagoon,"It is dusk on the Lost Lagoon,
And we two dreaming the dusk away,
Beneath the drift of a twilight grey—
Beneath the drowse of an ending day
And the curve of a golden moon.
It is dark on the Lost Lagoon,
And gone are the depths of haunting blue,
The grouping gulls, and the old canoe,
The singing firs, and the dusk and—you,
And gone is the golden moon.
O lure of the Lost Lagoon—
I dream to-night that my paddle blurs
The purple shade where the seaweed stirs—
I hear the call of the singing firs
In the hush of the golden moon."
The White-headed Woodpecker,"Quiet. Given to prying more than pecking, an odd member
of the family, lives only in the high pine forests of western
mountains like the Cascades, where I spent an afternoon
almost a decade ago in Roslyn, Washington looking for what
I could find of Black people who’d migrated from the South
almost a century and a quarter prior. The white-headed
woodpecker doesn’t migrate and so is found in its
home range year-round when it can be found. Roslyn,
founded as a coal mining town, drew miners from all over
Europe—as far away as Croatia—across the ocean, with
opportunities. With their hammering and drilling to extract
a living, woodpeckers could be considered arboreal miners.
A habitat, a home range, is where one can feed and house
oneself—meet the requirements of life—and propagate.
In 1888, those miners from many lands all in Roslyn came
together to go on strike against the mine management.
And so, from Southern states, a few hundred Black miners
were recruited with the promise of opportunities in Roslyn,
many with their families in tow, to break the strike. They
faced resentment and armed resistance, left in the dark
until their arrival, unwitting scabs—that healing that happens
after lacerations or abrasions. Things settled down as they do
sometimes, and eventually Blacks and whites entered a union
as equals. Black save for a white face and crown and a sliver
of white on its wings that flares to a crescent when they
spread for flight, the white-headed woodpecker is a study
in contrasts. Males have a patch of red feathers
on the back of their crowns, and I can’t help but see blood."
In the Discount Lot,"Outside the grocery store
laden with the sweat
of tanned field workers
we stand          little girls in winter coats
our hands hold signs leaflets
our dark long hair waist length
one straight, one curly
we say to the people
who walk up to the glass door
don’t buy the lettuce here—
they aren’t good to their workers
I don’t recall anyone
said anything back
or who stood with us
I remember my sister
next to me,      us
in our Sunday velvet best
she     beret and red plaid jacket
me     white rabbit skin muff
little brown girls with picket signs
rosy cheeks, big black eyes
legions of ghosts
above              behind
angels wing over us
ancestor feathers beat
in the invisible breeze
each time someone enters
or exits the building—
with a bag
full of groceries
oranges and eggs
celery and grapes."
Gun Control,"The gun—purchased legally
by our parents when I was ten,
shown to us, placed in our hands
that we might sense the weight, then placed
on a shelf any of us
could reach, though we did not, not yet—
pulled by our mother six years
later as I straddled her son’s
small body to stop his fists
from battering me—our mother,
misreading the scene, seeing
her youngest in danger, and me,
too large in her mind to be
handled any other way— our
mother holding the gun and
shaking the gun and crying, caught
in an act of betrayal,
not yet angry that I would run,
sock clad, to Sam’s Pitt Stop Fried
Chicken and Fish to tell Sam Pitt,
my boss from the last summer
to tell him with incredulity—
no, with something more naïve,
say, shock or hurt, that my mother
had just pulled a gun on me,
the good child, the obedient
child, and she, later, saying
she had no other choice
she had to save her boy,
the malt liquor on her breath,
the blue bull in her blood, remorse,
perhaps, in her voice as she
asked, without asking, for forgiveness,
the gun returned to the shelf."
Offering,"            after Mary Oliver
Here is the meat
and fat and bone
of the day. The smoke
too for the god of recognition.
A love offering,
where love is also
grief and mourning,
the business of waking
and moving in a body far
away from you,
sweet friend.
Where waking
and moving mean
crying or not crying,
but always breathing.
Mark how the light
bends through the dry
air, like breath,
at the end of the day.
Mark the chirbling of the bird
outside my window.
Mark the day we will see
one another again,
and what light there will be,
what song."
Río Chamita,"Mule deer browse in the meadow
                           and meander in clusters down the slope 
                                         across a dry pond bed;
at a shooting range, we stare at a machine 
               loaded with orange-centered circular targets
                                          but are not here to practice firing at ducks;
you climb a metal ladder, sit 
             on a bench high in a ponderosa pine, 
                          and, gazing far, say hunters shoot from here;
we step onto a floating dock, while swallows 
                           scissor the air, loop back, 
                                        fuchsia-streaked clouds undulate on the water;
and when we canoed around a floating island of reeds,
              I understood we came here  
                                          to ignite behind our eyelids—
a yellow-headed blackbird perches on a cattail;
                                         beyond a green metal fence, buffalo graze—
while water runs into this pond, before it spills 
                             over a metal gate into the Río Chamita,
                                                                 we gather our lives in this pooling—"
Jaguar Song,"—Just after you sign and envision building homes on this tract you smell me in the dark
know that I move through this terrain at night   though you only think of building 
and selling   even now you believe you can borrow my spirit by wearing a mask of my
face on your face   look at me   delve into your fears   is your deepest fear to be hacked 
strangled or be strapped to an IV in a bed with no chance to die   I can grasp a turtle 
and break its shell with one bite   I can pounce on a deer and crush its skull and neck 
with my teeth   you slash and burn in the jungle   force the snakes and macaws to retreat 
you even burn your own species alive   look into my eyes  I am your mirror and
transformer if you destroy my species I will shape-shift and hunt you in your dreams   
the fingerprints of your hands resemble the black rosettes on my skin and you will not
escape   you will never comprehend the twin nights in my eyes   remember as a child 
you came up the steps from the basement and flicking off the light at the top of the stairs
feared a hand about to grasp your shoulder from behind   that fear is alive   and now 
as you rummage for keys at your apartment doorstep I am a passing jogger about to
pounce I am the creature who smells your darkest thoughts   and as you turn the key 
in the lock day or night out of the darkness I spring—"
Scintillant,"Trudging uphill, I turn onto a deer path
then follow the switchbacks you marked
with orange streamers until I arrive
at a cairn and overlook where I view
the gold run of cottonwoods through the city;
western tanagers migrate through the city.
As I bask in the heat of the afternoon,
I cannot say I had the courage
to march on a bridge for the right
to vote and be beaten; at an antiwar rally,
I retreated when police, mounted on horses,
crossed the street with batons swinging.
As I stride down the switchbacks, I can’t
put into words the radiance of this day;
I stop at a robin’s nest lined with mud
fallen in the grass and scintillate
when at night we step into the yard
and stare up through apple branches at stars."
Acequia del Llano,"1
The word acequia is derived from the Arabic as-saqiya (water conduit)and refers to an
irrigation ditch that transports water from a river to farms and fields, as well as the
association of members connected to it.
                                                            Blossoming peach trees—
                                                            to the west, steel buildings glint 
                                                            above the mesa.                                                         
In Santa Fe, New Mexico, the Acequia del Llano is one and a half miles long and begins
at Nichols Reservoir dam. At the bottom of the dam, an outlet structure and flow meter
control water that runs through a four-inch pipe at up to one hundred-fifty gallons per
minute. The water runs along a hillside and eventually drops into the Santa Fe River.
Fifteen families and two organizations belong to this ditch association, and the acequia
irrigates about thirty acres of gardens and orchards.
                                                            In the ditch, water flowing—
                                                            now an eagle-feather wind.

Yarrow, rabbitbrush, claret cup cactus, one-seed juniper, Douglas fir, and scarlet
penstemon are some of the plants in this environment. Endangered and threatened species
include the southwestern willow flycatcher, the least tern, the violet-crowned
hummingbird, the American marten, and the white-tailed ptarmigan. 
                                                            Turning my flashlight 
                                                            behind me, I see a large 
                                                            buck, three feet away.
Each April, all of the members come, or hire workers who come, to do the annual spring
cleaning; this involves walking the length of the ditch, using shovels and clippers to clear
branches, silt, and other debris.
                                                            Twigs, pine needles, plastic bags
                                                            cleared today before moonrise—

The ditch association is organized with a mayordomo, ditch manager, who oversees the
distribution of water according to each parciante’s (holder of water rights) allotment. The
acequia runs at a higher elevation than all of the land held by the parciantes, so the flow of
water is gravity fed. 
                                                            Crisscrossing the ditch,
                                                            avoiding cholla,
                                                            I snag my hair on branches.
Each year the irrigation season runs from about April 15 to October 15. On Thursdays
and Sundays, at 5:30 a.m., I get up and walk about a quarter of a mile uphill to the ditch
and drop a metal gate into it. When the water level rises, water goes through screens 
then down two pipes and runs below to irrigate grass, lilacs, trees, and an orchard. 
                                                            Across the valley, ten lights
                                                             glimmer from hillside houses.

Orion and other constellations of stars stand out at that hour. As it moves toward summer,
the constellations shift, and, by July 1, when I walk uphill, I walk in early daylight. By
mid-September, I again go uphill in the dark and listen for coyote and deer in between the
piñons and junipers. 
                                                            One by one, we light
                                                            candles on leaves, let them go
                                                            flickering downstream.
The Ganges River is 1,569 miles long. The Rio Grande is l,896 miles long; it periodically
dries up, but when it runs its full length, it runs from its headwaters in the mountains of
southern Colorado into the Gulf of Mexico. Water from the Santa Fe River runs into the
Rio Grande. Water from the Acequia del Llano runs into the Santa Fe River. From a
length of one hundred paces along the acequia, I draw our allotment of water.
                                                            Here, I pull a translucent 
                                                            cactus spine out of your hand."
Sight Lines,"I’m walking in sight of the Río Nambe—
salt cedar rises through silt in an irrigation ditch—
the snowpack in the Sangre de Cristos has already dwindled before spring—
at least no fires erupt in the conifers above Los Alamos—
the plutonium waste has been hauled to an underground site—
a man who built plutonium-triggers breeds horses now—
no one could anticipate this distance from Monticello—
Jefferson despised newspapers, but no one thing takes us out of ourselves—
during the Cultural Revolution, a boy saw his mother shot in front of a firing squad—
a woman detonates when a spam text triggers bombs strapped to her body—
when I come to an upright circular steel lid, I step out of the ditch—
I step out of the ditch but step deeper into myself—
I arrive at a space that no longer needs autumn or spring—
I find ginseng where there is no ginseng my talisman of desire—
though you are visiting Paris, you are here at my fingertips—
though I step back into the ditch, no whitening cloud dispels this world’s mystery—
the ditch ran before the year of the Louisiana Purchase—
I’m walking on silt, glimpsing horses in the field—
fielding the shapes of our bodies in white sand—
though parallel lines touch in the infinite, the infinite is here—"
Artless,"is my heart. A stranger
berry there never was,
tartless.
Gone sour in the sun,
in the sunroom or moonroof,
ruthless.
No poetry.  Plain.  No 
fresh, special recipe
to bless.
All I've ever made 
with these hands 
and life, less
substance, more rind. 
Mostly rim and trim,
meatless
but making much smoke
in the old smokehouse,
no less. 
Fatted from the day, 
overripe and even
toxic at eve.  Nonetheless,
in the end, if you must 
know, if I must bend,
waistless,
to that excruciation.  
No marvel, no harvest
left me speechless,
yet I find myself
somehow with heart,
aloneless.
With heart,
fighting fire with fire,
flightless.
That loud hub of us, 
meat stub of us, beating us
senseless.
Spectacular in its way,
its way of not seeing, 
congealing dayless
but in everydayness.
In that hopeful haunting,
(a lesser
way of saying
in darkness) there is
silencelessness
for the pressing question. 
Heart, what art you? 
War, star, part? Or less: 
playing a part, staying apart
from the one who loves,
loveless."
Nachtraglichtkeit,"               —after Kaja Silverman’s Flesh of My Flesh
On having slashed myself from throat to instep
in one unbroken line,
I suppose it was a reenactment, Freud's Nachtraglichkeit:
the second act.  The past presses so hard
on the present, the present is badly bruised,
blood brims under the skin.
That was the situation I was in.  Wearing a jacket of blood
from an earlier crime,
which was also mine.  A curving zipper with misaligned
teeth, open to show red lipstick,
meat.  And a stage smile, have a seat!  Normally I'm much
more careful, naturally something
like this would only ever happen in a dream,
but even dreams have their dreams
of finding their dreamer awake, silent within earshot,
carving knife in hand.  

Did you know that anguish thins the blood and thickens
the vessel?  It was like cutting
a rare steak.  A minotaur, glittering with rubies
and pink candles.  My hands hung
like electrical wires off a building on the edge of collapse,
every one of my gestures symbolic,
ruined of magic.  For there is no miraculous beast,
and there never was, standing
on the golden field of frozen honey clover,
each leaf strong enough to bend
under everything's weight. Strong because it bends.
Because it has already been crushed,
but its cells know that blight, one massive cut,
will slit each tiny skin surgically
in order to save the field from itself.  I cannot suffer
the same fate twice,  force my own hand
or stay it.  Can't repeat or unrepeat.  This finitude
is infinite and infinitely expanding."
Our Family on the Run,"Everything organized around Cal in his wheelchair. He can’t walk and I can’t carry him far. We’d have the wheelchair van, as long as we could find gas. Simone in the side seat, Craig and me in the front. 
Maybe spray paint a Super Soaker metallic silver to look like a real weapon? 
Load the car up with cans of enteral food for Cal’s g-tube. Maybe a six-week supply, plus a go-backpack full of cans, extensions, spare Mick-E button. Three days of food for the rest of us. We’ll find water. 
Sleeping in the front seats, taking turns on watch. Simone curled up next to the gas can and ziplock of batteries/cords/chargers, with her one stuffed animal we have to worry about something happening to, her only toy. 
And      what      if      we      lose      the      car?      Running      on      some      side      road to—Pennsylvania/airport/Atlantic/evacuation center/relocation camp/as yet unknown. Trying to buy a blow-up raft for four people. Can’t take the wheelchair. 
Our stack of euros to buy four plane tickets: can’t take the wheelchair. 
On foot, trying to get to a friend’s country home, promise of a bedroom. No way to call the friend for directions. A compass one of the kids got at a birthday party wound up under a car seat. Lucky.
Lucky too Simone can walk—though she gets tired and I’d want to hoist her on my back if I didn’t have to save my energy to carry Cal when Craig’s legs give way, his back out. 
Cal, four foot six and sixty pounds of tween, who must be carried if we somehow lose that wheelchair. Or the wheelchair breaks, or is stolen, or gets a flat tire, or rusts. 
It’s red, a color Cal chose by smiling when we said “red” in a list of colors. No expression when we said blue, green, black, purple or pink. Big smile when we said red. He had his choice and he made it. 
How strange that the color of his wheelchair ever mattered enough to anyone to offer him that handful of options. 
Simone is hungry. I give her a Clif bar (that 24 pack I bought for rushed mornings) and she drops half of it on the dirt road, which is covered in, what, bone dust or atomized drywall? 
She grabs what she dropped and stuffs it into her mouth before I can stop her. Why would I stop her? 
The side of the road is the well-known gutter of desperation always included in stories about wars where many people have to move on foot to the next terrible place. 
No matter what the emergency, whenever people are forced to flee you find, piece by piece, how their understanding of their situation changed. 
If you read the stories, you’re supposed to find abandoned photo albums, suitcases, babies. The useless things cut out by survival’s swift knife. Dead weight, long gone. 
You never find food, bottled water, working flashlights, live batteries, short wave radios. It’s true, what all those stories said, it turns out. 
Eventually out of water and arms shredded, I carry Cal, Craig carries me, and Simone carries us all. Almost seven years old, she is so strong and has some Clif bars stuffed in a bag. The notebook with all our information is long lost. 
She knows where she’s going. How does she know that?  She runs ahead and carries us, her heart pounding and breaking with the weight and strain of all of us in there."
Blueberries for Cal,"Watching little Henry, 6, scoop up blueberries
and shovel them into his mouth, possessed.
I’m so glad I brought blueberries—wish my kids
could/would eat them. Cal can’t; Simone won’t.
Henry’s sisters Lucy & Jane took turns feeding each
other goldfish crackers and sips of juice. 
Arms around each other’s neck and back. Tiny things.
I  wish my daughter had a sister like that
and my son a nervous system that let him walk
and munch berries. Sometimes I can’t bear
all the things Cal doesn’t get to do. I want to curse
everything I can’t give him. 
Admire/compare/despair—that’s not the most real 
feeling I’m feeling, is it?  I feel joy in Henry’s joy. 
Blueberries for the child who wants them.
There’s all this energetic sweetness, enough to go around,
to give and taste and trust. More than enough.
For Cal too.  I want to remember this.  
My children seem to subsist on music and frosting. 
Where there’s frosting, there’s cake. 
Where there’s music, someone chose to make a song 
over all other things on this earth. "
Identity & Community (There is no “I” in “Sea”),"I don’t want to be surrounded by people. Or even one person. But I don’t want to always be alone. 
The answer is to become my own pet, hungry for plenty in a plentiful place. 
There is no true solitude, only only. 
At seaside, I have that familiar sense of being left out, too far to glean the secret: how go in?
What an inhuman surface the sea has, always open.
I’m too afraid to go in. I give no yes.
Full of shame, but refuse to litter ever. I pick myself up.
Wind has power. Sun has power. What is power’s source?

There’s no privacy outside. We’ve invaded it. 
There is no life outside empire.  All paradise is performance for people who pay. 
Perhaps I’m an invader and feel I haven’t paid. 
What a waste, to have lost everything in mind.

                       *                                   *                                  *

Watching three mom-like women try to go in, I’m green—I want to join them.  
But they are not my women.  I join them, apologizing. 
They splash away from me—they’re their pod. People are alien. 
I’m an unknown story, erasing myself with seawater. 
There goes my honey and fog, my shoulders and legs.

                       *                                   *                                  *

What could be queerer than this queer tug-lust for what already is, who already am, but other of it?
Happens? That kind of desire anymore? 
Oh I am that queer thing pulling and greener than the blue sea. I’m new with envy. 
Beauty washing over itself. No reflection. No claim. Nothing to see. 
If there’s anything bluer than the ocean it’s its greenness. It’s its turquoise blood, mixing me.

                       *                                   *                                  *

I was a woman alone in the sea. 
Don’t tell anybody, I tell myself.
Don’t try to remember this. Don’t document it.  
Remember: write down to not-document it."
Self-Compassion,"My friend and I snickered the first time
we heard the meditation teacher, a grown man,
call himself honey, with a hand placed
over his heart to illustrate how we too 
might become more gentle with ourselves
and our runaway minds. It’s been years
since we sat with legs twisted on cushions,
holding back our laughter, but today
I found myself crouched on the floor again,
not meditating exactly, just agreeing
to be still, saying honey to myself each time
I thought about my husband splayed
on the couch with aching joints and fever
from a tick bite—what if he never gets better?—
or considered the threat of more wildfires,
the possible collapse of the Gulf Stream,
then remembered that in a few more minutes, 
I’d have to climb down to the cellar and empty
the bucket I placed beneath a leaky pipe
that can’t be fixed until next week. How long
do any of us really have before the body
begins to break down and empty its mysteries
into the air? Oh honey, I said—for once
without a trace of irony or blush of shame—
the touch of my own hand on my chest
like that of a stranger, oddly comforting
in spite of the facts."
Anne,"I imagine today just like yesterday—
I will spend the morning writing and then,
when the tide recedes, I’ll trip along drift lines
searching. Yesterday I found an entire sand dollar
and four amber sea agates. The day before—
a red plastic heart stuck in driftwood. But
Anne,     what I really want to find
is a buoy. A fine glass fishing buoy, like the one
you brought to our third-grade show-and-tell
in 1982. A perfect glass bauble, wrapped in brown
hemp. Mint green, cerulean, sparkling, and you,
Anne, gleaming, cradling the globe, in small,
flawless hands. You illumed, Anne, in front of the class,
teaching us what your Grandma taught you
about glassblowing and fishing nets and the tide
that carried that buoy all the way from Japan
to the Oregon Coast, so far from our landlocked
Colorado town, so far from anywhere
our imaginations had yet taken us. Even those of us
in the back row could see. Anne,
tall and gangly, shy and anxious, you traveled
to the sea and brought back a flawless
glass buoy. Even those who teased you hardest
felt the weight of envy. “Be careful,”
you begged us, hinting finally toward fragility, rarity.
Yet these years later I am still searching the wrack
lines, my hands begging back that unbroken
weight, as if by finding my own buoy I might know something
about…     Anne,
please forgive me, I held on too loose—
what do ten-year-old hands know of mortality or the way
lives can be shattered on coasts? What
does this forty-nine-year-old heart understand
about the mechanics of staying afloat, of netting a life
and not letting go?"

Indians will keep their spirits near—
    Creeping about in the open air
No one knows where.
Down in the deep my spirit will creep,
    Fearless of sorrow and fearless of time,
Indian will seek a spirit to help his creed.
     Out of the window into the air
No one knows where.
    Indian spirit shall share
Deathless and lifeless, sleepless of fear
     The noise of my spirit shall speak very clear.
Out of the window into the air

When far into the darkened night a change in the air
    The Indian spirit shall creep out of no where."

  2. Mare Nubium
Turn west toward granite chop and shut
your eyes. Think of what you desire. Spread
your arms to manifest four humors in the arc. Clouds
will form in the shape of a precipice woman stone
eagle. You will be torn. You will be called
a fumbler. Clouds will form in the shape of a
child wren hand boat. You will be lofted.
You will be called a savior. Clouds form.
You open your arms. Rain at last lets down.
  3. Mare Tranquillitatis
All our stories sputtered
out. Waves
the only language
left. Empty wine bottle
nestled against
a driftwood bulwark.
Blue hour after
the sun, before dark,
and you kept
pushing your hair
out of your eyes
so you could watch
light forget
the mountains.
  4. Mare Cognitum
Maybe afterward we know.
In this living there is no space
for recognition. I’d hang a ribbon
above the water. I’d be a book.
Finder’s fee to anyone who can
point out the route. Here. After.
  5. Oceanus Procellarum
Once, electricity crawled through my arm and raised
a blister on each fingertip. Once, I choked on a stone.
Air pushing against barrier. Once, a car struck and I
kept traveling. Glass fragments in my hair and a broken
wing. I’ve never been good at this, saying which thump
bruised and which thump distorted. I wanted with
the whole structure I built as my being. Pulled myself
out of a life and into another. Low pressure rolling in
along my spine and settling. I want to open up now
and let it all out. Go ahead, make up a story of how
I was cold and unapproachable. Most shining when
closest but still bringing out the wind, bringing out the storm."
In the Meantime,"The river rose wildly every seventh spring
or so, and down the hatch went the town,
just a floating hat box or two, a cradle,
a cellar door like an ark to float us back
into the story of how we drown but never
for good, or long. How the ornate numbers 
of the bank clock filled with flood, how 
we scraped minute by minute the mud 
from the hours and days until the gears
of time started to catch and count again.
Calamity is how the story goes, how
we built the books of the Bible. Not 
the one for church, but the one the gods
of weather inscribed into our shoulder
blades and jawbones to grant them grit
enough to work the dumb flour of day
into bread and breath again. The world
has a habit of ending, every grandmother 
and father knew well enough never to say,
so deeply was it stained into the brick 
and mind. We live in the meantime
is how I remember the length of twilight 
and late summer cicadas grinding the air
into what seemed like unholy racket to us, 
but for them was the world’s only music."
On Working Remotely & No Longer Commuting with Chronic Pain,"the train leaves the station without me / so does the bus / the sidewalks stay empty of my steps—the rushed ones, the ones pierced with pain, the its-too-late-at-night to still be walking ones / i keep my cash / it doesn’t load my metro card and then another card when the first one’s lost / i don’t panic in the car about leaving late—least not as much / when winter comes, i don’t sit on the cold, cold bench waiting and waiting, clutching a pair of my stockpiled hand warmers / i don’t bundle myself up in oppressive layers / or unravel in the late night, releasing the day’s pressure like a punctured balloon / instead i sit / and continue to sit / in this chair then that one / look out the window to escape the screen’s demands / wonder how i ever had fuel for those past travels / i rest / and i rise / and listen to the body that’s carried me here as it whispers the way forward"
Ultra Orator Spell,"I become the song I’ve been
singing alone in this field with you.
What deal did we make that leaps
so far behind both into the horizon 
and from it? Some grim comfort
has come my way in the form
of an ox. The ox struggles to remain
in my consciousness, an unfounded
howl yearning to ring around
a ventriloquist’s echo. I’ve become
too busy for such nonsense, so I cast
it into the places where I retreat myself,
the ecstatic, gratitudinal rest and re-
storation of popular music. My goal
isn’t to unfold popular music once
more, rather it is to speak now to
how the animals say it better. Make
the nominal joy render justice. Make
a joke of nothing. Grade this remark
holding no reluctance today, only hope."
Jellyfish Olympics,"There are wires and cords
that stretch out, 
hang dangling
from the hospital bed,
the transparent filigree 
of a floating jellyfish.
One leads to the phone
to order food. 
One leads to the TV, so we can stare at
cooking shows with delicacies not available here.
One leads to compression wraps
for your vulnerable legs.
Another leads to the IV ports 
in your bruised, crepe-skinned arm.
In between your long spells of sleeping
and my knitting, 
we enjoy the pretend competition
of the contestants cooking.
We marvel at how quickly 
they move about the kitchen.
I marvel even more at your careful movements
and the miracle of progress after your fall.
We count the steps you take
as if you are skipping stones—
any number makes you a winner. 
You fight for everyday markers of strength,
your efforts a perfect ten.
This is the Olympics of rehabilitation.
Cotton gown diamond patterns 
become your fashion.
We look out the window as day becomes night.
Another day passes 
in the goldfish bowl of recovery,
a blue ribbon day of taking five steps 
just to turn around
and walk back to the bed."
Sonnets from the Cherokee (I),"My heart is like an opal, flashing fire
And flaming gleams of pointed light
At thy approach; or lying cold and white
When thou art gone; robbed of a dream’s desire
Is left moon-white and dull; no darting flame
Or sapphire gleam to mark a sweet suspense.
But only still, benumbed indifference
Unwaked at thy soft whisper of my name.
Come now, I tire of waiting to know love;
Teach me to scorn indifference white and dim
For I would drain fate’s cup of joy or strife;
Would play to the lost chord the vibrant hymn
That passion sings; my heart lifted above
Dull apathy; pulsating; knowing Life."
We Feel Now A Largeness Coming On,"Being called all manner of things
from the Dictionary of Shame—
not English, not words, not heard,
but worn, borne, carried, never spent—
we feel now a largeness coming on,
something passing into us. We know
not in what source it was begun, but
rapt, we watch it rise through our fallen,
our slain, our millions dragged, chained.
Like daylight setting leaves alight—
green to gold to blinding white.
Like a spirit caught. Flame-in-flesh.
I watched a woman try to shake it, once,
from her shoulders and hips. A wild
annihilating fright. Other women
formed a wall around her, holding back
what clamored to rise. God. Devil.
Ancestor. What Black bodies carry
through your schools, your cities.
Do you see how mighty you’ve made us,
all these generations running?
Every day steeling ourselves against it.
Every day coaxing it back into coils.
And all the while feeding it.
And all the while loving it."
Unto Ourselves: to See What’s There,"To see what’s there and not already
 
patterned by familiarity— for an unpredicted
 
whole is there, casting a pair of shadows, manipulating
 
its material, advancing, assembling enough
 
kinship that we call it life, our life, what
 
is already many lives, the dimensions of
 
its magnitude veiled to us as we live it––
  
Across the cytoplasm of adjacent cells
 
goes a signal that turns you toward me, turns
 
me into you. We are coupled in quiet
 
tumult, convergent arguments, an alien
 
rhythm becoming familiar. A rhythm
 
of I am here, never to be peeled away.
 
We are become one thing
 
                                                         Listening
  
or what’s there and not. Through the storm,
 
neem trees on the hill stamp wildly
 
in their roots. We have passed through
 
the spring, but what thing has passed
 
through us? Now your laughter
 
transparentizes me. And whose sense
 
of the self doesn’t swerve? Your unconditional
 
foreignness grows conditional, stops
 
being foreign at all. With your nearness,
 
my lens on the world shifts. A peristaltic
 
contraction courses through us as a single
 
wave. No longer can we keep our distance.
 
Our lips brush, or the tips of ourselves.
  
But what language are you whispering to me
 
your teeth stained by nilgiri tea, above the trills
 
and whistles in the high limbs, above the screech
 
of a bulldozer blade shoving rubble
 
up the wounded street, above the silence
 
of an eyeless tick climbing a grass stem? I understand
 
nothing but the lust your voice incites, the
 
declamatory tenderness. How, and who can say
 
what force has cued up this hour for our
 
small voices to merge into a carnality
 
that did not exist before now.
  
Having come to this unforeseen
 
conjunction, we slip
 
into one another, we take hold
 
in a pulse of heat, —in a yes and no—
 
for already we can see
 
we are no longer what we were
  
as I find you within me—not fused, not
 
bonded, but nested. And for you, is it
 
the same?—the intensity of such
 
investment, each of us excited
 
by the volatility of the other which
 
propels us in a rush as something,
 
perhaps our lips brush or
 
the tips of ourselves, stripping
 
away what?—what was before? Was there
 
even anything before?
  
The reconfiguration is instantaneous
 
experience. It is being
 
itself. But whose being now? Was I
 
endowed with some special pliability so
 
that becoming part of you I didn’t pass
 
through my own nihilation? And what
 
does the death of who-you-were mean to me
 
except that now you are present, constantly.
   Because excess is what it took
 
for us to transform, to effulge. You cast
 
your life beyond itself. Can’t you sense me
 
within your ecstatic openness
 
like rain mingling with red earth?
 
Without you I survived and with you
 
I live again in a radical augmentation
 
of identity because we have
 
effaced our outer limits, because
 
we summoned each other. In you,
 
I cast my life beyond itself."
Mothership,"You cannot see the Mothership in space,
It and She being made of the same thing.
All our mothers hover there in the ceaseless
blue-black, watching it ripple and dim
to the prized pale blue in which we spin—
we who are Black, and you, too. Our mothers
know each other there, fully and finally.
They see what some here see and call anomaly:
the way the sight of me might set off
a shiver in another mother’s son: a deadly
silent digging in: a stolid refusal to budge:
the viral urge to stake out what on solid ground
is Authority, and sometimes also Territory.
Our mothers, knowing better, call it Folly."
Eat,"He said, “Son of man, eat what is given to you; eat this scroll…”
                                                                                  Ezekiel 3:1
If you feed me with thin parchment
made from the papyrus of ancient rivers
that green the desert’s edge,
and if you feed me the torn sheets, stained
in sepia from mashed berries of old lands,
and if you feed me the bitter taste
of your commanding, my belly
burning with the acid of your ire,
and if you force me to feed on
the burdens of your heart,
and if I bend over the toilet bowl,
the juices in my stomach churning
on a fevered southern night,
I will be the dry brush
set aflame by your truth.
A man must know when night’s
reflux—the throat burning
with half-digested meals—is the heat
of the spirit blessing his head.
Lord, don’t let me eat your words, no more.
Lord, just can’t eat them words, no more."
Last Days,"Rain and ashes seal my lips
                                          Allen Ginsberg
In the season of drought and hurricane,
this stiff earth cracks and the spawned
eggs of mosquitoes burst into a plague
of coughs and side stitches. Every wild bird
predicts a plague of woes. All around us
the whisper is of “Last Days”, the coming
of the end, and the tyranny of present danger.
December 21, 2005, Marvin Williams,
ex-Drill Sergeant and born-again Arkansas
cotton-picker, remembers the morning he
was bumped from the airliner that flamed
over Lockerbie. Blessed, he says, trying
to calculate the debts he still owes.
Why was he kept; for what?
The dragonflies are dying,
and in the suburbs the pandemic
runs amok. Our bodies betray us
and the summer’s heat warms
the sea, as deep as plummet sounds.
In the desert it rains in deluge,
while the glaciers vanish from mountains.
The stars die a million years ago.
On a beach in Bahia,
a congregation in white descends
to the water’s edge, singing. The surf lips
the disembowelled carcasses of small
animals. A rash of flowers eddies
on the swollen surface like a garland of prayer.
Better go to the house of mourning
than to the house of feasting."
How to Apologize,"Cook a large fish—choose one with many bones, a skeleton
you will need skill to expose, maybe the flying
silver carp that's invaded the Great Lakes, tumbling
the others into oblivion. If you don't live
near a lake, you'll have to travel.
Walking is best and shows you mean it,
but you could take a train and let yourself
be soothed by the rocking
on the rails. It's permitted
to receive solace for whatever you did
or didn't do, pitiful, beautiful
human. When my mother was in the hospital,
my daughter and I had to clear out the home
she wouldn't return to. Then she recovered
and asked, incredulous,
How could you have thrown out all my shoes?
So you'll need a boat. You could rent or buy,
but, for the sake of repairing the world,
build your own. Thin strips
of Western red cedar are perfect,
but don't cut a tree. There'll be
a demolished barn or downed trunk
if you venture further.
And someone will have a mill.
And someone will loan you tools.
The perfume of sawdust and the curls
that fall from your plane
will sweeten the hours. Each night
we dream thirty-six billion dreams. In one night
we could dream back everything lost.
So grill the pale flesh.
Unharness yourself from your weary stories.
Then carry the oily, succulent fish to the one you hurt.
There is much to fear as a creature
caught in time, but this
is safe. You need no defense. This
is just another way to know
you are alive."
Hotbed 66,"They tell me that she spent her days staring at the eyes of peonies, the fragile skin of day lilies, the open mouths of daffodils, the waxy and waning winks and pinks of peace lilies. I’m telling you this woman knew flowers. They say she was driving to work when she saw him, or did they say she was delivering a bouquet of fresh cut flowers to someone on their birthday, or had just come from the door of some sweet couple’s fiftieth anniversary? I can’t remember all of that right now. All I can think about is what she must have known about flowers before this moment began. I know she was a woman out on the road driving and paying very close attention to the world around her. She was also a woman who did not look away when she saw his soup-bowl haircut pass by one lane over. Was his upside-down empty vase of a neck the giveaway? In the car that was not going too fast and not going too slow. In the car that had a backseat. Was the backseat where he put the gun that he had just used to kill the nine praying sunflowers of Mother Emanuel? Or was the gun there in the front seat with him? By then, back in Charleston the nine passion flowers were slumped on the basement floor inside the church. The nine calla lilies had been snapped in two. She saw his funny haircut and quickly recognized him as the one who had just taken the lives of the nine human beings, in mid and full bloom, who had welcomed him, called him son, invited him to sit and be with them in the name of the Father, the Son, the Holy Ghost. Ten fragrant gardenias had welcomed him to their circle and the flower lady was the one who recognized the long flowerless vase of his neck and made the call. What did she say on that phone? Hello. I’m calling to report a sighting. That young man you are looking for . . . who shot up that church . . . he’s here on the highway with me . . . a black Hyundai. I know it’s him, he’s covered, head to toe, in pollen. "

           —Kazim Ali, Silver Road
born from small
waters. Each night,
I look for paper
to feed this first litter
from a slow continent.
New trappers buy
their fetters and hooks,
dreaming of new skin

like river, opening up again
to bird. Neighborhood pushes
against seams, dislikes
a newcomer. This linked
to history and forgetting—
a new gray house like a weed.
A monument rises past the window. We sit and drink twice-steeped tea."
A Witch’s Chant,"    Thou art weary, weary, weary,
        Thou art weary and far away,
    Hear me, gentle spirit, hear me,
        Come before the dawn of day.
I hear a small voice from the hill,
The vapour is deadly, pale, and still—
A murmuring sough is on the wood,
And the witching star is red as blood.
And in the cleft of heaven I scan
The giant form of a naked man,
His eye is like the burning brand,
And he holds a sword in his right hand.
All is not well. By dint of spell,
Somewhere between the heaven and hell
There is this night a wild deray,
The spirits have wander’d from their way.
The purple drops shall tinge the moon
As she wanders through the midnight noon;
And the dawning heaven shall all be red
With blood by guilty angels shed.
Be as it will, I have the skill
To work by good or work by ill;
Then here’s for pain, and here’s for thrall,
And here’s for conscience, worst of all.
Another chant, and then, and then,
Spirits shall come or Christian men—
Come from the earth, the air, or the sea,
Great Gil-Moules, I cry to thee!
Sleep’st thou, wakest thou, lord of the wind,
Mount thy steeds and gallop them blind;
And the long-tailed fiery dragon outfly
The rocket of heaven, the bomb of the sky.
Over the dog-star, over the wain,
Over the cloud, and the rainbow’s mane,
Over the mountain, and over the sea,
    Haste—haste—haste to me!
Then here’s for trouble, and here’s for smart,
And here’s for the pang that seeks the heart;
Here’s for madness, and here’s for thrall,
And here’s for conscience, the worst of all!"
To My Friends,"You feeble few that hold me somewhat more
Than all I am; base clay and spittle joined
To shape an aimless whim substantial; coined
Amiss one idle hour, this heart, though poor, —
O golden host I count upon the ends
Of one bare hand, with fingers still to spare, —
Is rich enough for this: to harbor there
In opulence its frugal meed of friends.
Let neither lose his faith, lest by such loss
Each find insufferable his daily cross.
And be not less immovable to me,
Not less love-leal and staunch, than my heart is.
In brief, these fine heroics come to this,
My friends: if you are true, I needs must be."
Safe Harbor in Enemy Homes,"Even the trees are not blameless here—
they choose sides, shelter conspiracy,
and lend their limbs to massacre
on this green knuckle of mountain
made retreat for writers and fiber artists,
potters, lapidarists, and some of history’s
most famous racists—folks so deeply dyed
it’s not clear anymore what they’ll break for.
And I would be ready sure to steady burn
this sturdy cabin so clean, tendered
to me for shelter, for there is
no place in this good green earth
safe from its own history’s hollowed-out horrors.
Who among us can take a retreat from horrors,
who seeks to beat a hasty one from consequence or scrutiny,
and how do we make any peace
when even our retreats choose sides:
            fostering peace and unity
            recruits starched southerners to sponsor 
            apartheid in some land hallowed
            by war to hasten the end times,
            because in the beginning, this place housed travelers
            merely means meetings
            for the organizers and fundraisers of b’nai b’rith.
            and supporting his brethren 
            funds youth militias to clear houses and empty villages
In this gracious confrontation
under the sweet breath of branches
on land reclaimed by zion from the hands
of a clansman propagandist and a friend of presidents:
            Here we are supplied with a partial archive
            in a refuge built against two reckonings:
            so which lines are pointed enough
            to pierce the open copping to crimes—
            left unlocked on library shelves, 
            framed on the wall, celebrated with a graven plaque?
            Every shelf is dreaming two nations’ glory.
            Every shelf is a recruitment, ahistory,
            every shelf complicity among the ruins.
My words endure in the frayed spine.
Peel back the coversheet and find:
I’m in your retreat, righting where the pages
of the deep south touch palestine.
Have I not come here to find safe harbor
at the point of a knife, daring respite
or the remediation of ill-gotten spoils—
and spoiling for a fight, am I not reminded
no harbor is safe and every port is the point of a nation’s knife."
Vermilion,"“The lake was originally called Onamaniig which means ‘ochre’ because it was remembered by Anishinaabeg as a place that the people of the Red Ochre culture lived.”
                  —Margaret Noodin
The red eye 
of a loon
for vision,
depths of water
who can say 
what will pass 
as, protection
reeds
edges of place
are only
temporary,
circling
filters the blues
and greens
as they have 
always done
dives for minutes
crayfish, light re-
fracted, what could be
slowed
just enough 
to catch a meal
or your eye,
indelible flash, 
a crimson ribbon
ablaze, crossing 
the lake
where you stand 
watching 
just then
with the grasses
from shore."
Tower of Babel,"Praise be to God for confounding our tongues and scattering us into exile 
like chaff in a stray wind or the fig seeds dropped by a green iguacaon on a hogplum.
Confusion is sweetest chirimoya on a dry tongue. 
Hymns of disorder bring bountiful harvests in times of drought, 
And perhaps only cross-eyes can see in chaos serene mandalas. 
I shout from the top of my Babel’s tower sown as a kapok tree— 
Blessed are the dialects, the patois, the argots, and the pidgins; 
the half-breed word-hoards and the mongrel grammars; the geechees, 
the calós, and the ghost words; those hallowed languages gone dead 
or worse extinct because of genocide or conquest or just time’s erosion, 
yet how we must mourn each one in our bones, hearts, spleens; 
then join hands by the sea at dawn to chant their names in flames 
of gumbo-limbo, O so many to remember: Elmolo, Mawa, Ba-Shu, 
Koibal, Guanche, Calusa, Wichita, and the Taíno of my own island—
Kubanakán—whose words linger past the cyclones of our sadness
like flotsam chromosomes or castaway fossils of such beautiful amber 
as barbacoa, canoa, fotuto, hamaca, iguana, malanga, tabaco, yuca.  
With these words I make machines of memory in flesh and marrow. 
With these words I glide and cleave the tidal waves of history.  
With these words I take root in the quicksands of diaspora.  "
Let There Be,"for Jaiden Peter Morgan
A good poem

    but a dwelling space

    cool inner darkness
    before ceremony 
    it is you 
    who will heal 
    these wounds
a good poem

so let there be mountains
singing in all directions
let there be laughter
uninterrupted and innocent

Emily Said,"Emily said she heard a fly buzz
when she died, heard it whizz
over her head, troubling her frizzed
hair. What will I hear? Showbiz
tunes on the radio, the megahertz
fuzz when the station picks up Yaz,
not the Hall-of-Famer or the Pez
of contraceptives, but the jazzy
flash-in-the-pan ’80’s techno-pop star, peach fuzz
on her rouged cheeks singing Pal-ease
Don’t Go through a kazoo. Will my old love spritz
the air with the perfume of old roses,
buy me the white satin Mercedes-Benz
of pillows, string a rainbow blitz
of crystals in the window—quartz, topaz—
or will I die wheezing, listening to a quiz
show: What year is this? Who was the 44th Prez
of the United States? Where is the Suez
Canal? Are you too hot? Cold? Freezing?"
Mildew,"Behold, within that cavern drear and dank,
    Whose walls in rainbow tints so dimly shine,
A wretch, with swollen eyes and tresses lank,
    Does on a heap of mould’ring leaves recline.
Unwholsome dews for ever him surround,
    From his damp couch he scarcely ever hies,
Save when blue vapours, issuing from the ground,
    Lure him abroad, to catch them as they rise.
Or else at eve the dripping rock he loves,
    Or the moist edge of new‐dug grave, full well;
To get the sea spray too at night he roves,
    And, gem’d with trickling drops, then seeks his cell.
Such his delights, his green and purple cheek,
    His bloated form, his chill, discolour'd hand
He would not change; and if he guests would seek,
    He steals among the church‐yard’s grisly hand."

Domestic terminals do not have this railing at the exit.
As we wait for her to exit customs, our sightline is obstructed by opaque
      sliding doors, the twisting hallway behind it, the small convex mirror
      hung in the corner in which we catch shapes growing larger, into hair
      color, into gait, into age, and finally, as they turn, into kin.
The hours I’ve stood there, behind that railing.
The hours I’ve stood to savor the seconds earlier, seconds more by which
      my eye may reach the disembarking and exclaimed, “She’s here,”
      watched, from shadow to shape to gait, my imagined life come to life
      and approach, briefly, me.
My imagined life crying hot in my ear.
Ink on its fingerpads.
This will be the last I write of it directly, I say each time.
This is a light that lights everything and dimly. 
All my waiting at this railing.
All my writing is this squint."
Aubade on a Ghost Hunt,"We prefer to do it with the lights on, 
the Victrola scratching How long can it last?
against the tremble of curtains. Patient,
we learn the walls, their glossary of knocks,
translating harlequin and dust. What we
know lives here—lonely bone star blossom
of the spider plant, lost bee on the sill,
the recorder’s static alive and puckering.
I tell you our future is the guttering candle
in the basement birdcage. Prove it, you say,
and I set both its shadows swaying. Our history—
the attic window, how the unseen surprises
the photograph. You ask what is there
to be afraid of. I ask the past to make itself
known to me. We only have to make it through
the night, so we close the dolls’ eyes. Danger
midwifes the heart’s spring. We are cabbage roses 
grooming the parlor air with unsexed pistils. 
I have this kiss and its sleepless itinerary. 
Your lip, pink logic and cushion. The door 
tests its lock, and I let you ruin each light
orb and whisper with physics. If we’re sure
something is here, then we have to find out 
what it wants. A voice on the recorder, sweet
as gravecake—don’t go. We can admit it wasn’t
proof we came for, it was the question."

   So our boat breaks the water
               Witchingly.
                      II.
As her look the dream troubles
          Of her tearful-eyed lover,
So our sails in the bubbles

   Are mirrored, and hover

Sonnet XLIV,"written in the churchyard at Middleton in Sussex
Press’d by the Moon, mute arbitress of tides,
    While the loud equinox its pow’r combines,
    The sea no more its swelling surge confines,
But o’er the shrinking land sublimely rides.
The wild blasts, rising from the Western cave,
    Drives the huge billows from their heaving bed;
    Tears from their grassy tombs the village dead,
And breaks the silent sabbath of the grave!
With shells and seaweed mingled, on the shore,
    Lo! their bones whiten in the frequent wave;
    But vain to them the winds and waters rave;
They hear the warring elements no more:
While I am doom’d—by life’s long storm opprest,
To gaze with envy, on their gloomy rest."

One Summer,"On April 22, 1993, 18-year-old 2nd Generation Jamaican youth Stephen Lawrence was attacked and stabbed to death in an unprovoked hate crime by a gang of white boys as he waited at a bus stop in London. His murderers were acquitted and allowed to walk free for 18 years, until two of his six killers were convicted of murder in 2011.
for Stephen Lawrence (September 13, 1974—April 22, 1993)
In the dream, Stephen  
you’re thicker than when we were young
but thoughtful, as a first kiss.  
We had one summer in Kingston 
before England’s white boys 
kicked, clubbed, knifed you.   
Too brief again, this August light 
its hours shifting. And hate, a hungry  
animal that only takes.  
The day your family stood above  
your grave, swept by coconut palms 
and a small bird orchestra 
I smashed the shuttlecock  
repeatedly against my backyard wall
my grief knocking back 
against the day’s blunt silence. 
What loves still lives, transforms  
my days, each night 
each decade passing—  
I follow you, and return to the gate 
you towered over  
that careless summer 
when you were just a boy  
laughing against the sky 
and I still believed in the light  
and what it makes of us."
Dear Birmingham,"I’ve been visiting again
the cemetery
with a sunken southern corner.
Fish smaller than first teeth, birthed from the soil,
maneuver in the glaze
where rain pools, covering the lowest stones.
            Behind him, in a cracked white tub,
my knees to his sides,
left ear pressed to
the stack of bones in his neck,
I was once so terrified of my own contentment
I bit my shoulder
and drew blood there
                        to the surface—past it—
What I have wanted most
is many lives. One for each longing,
round and separate.
Sometimes I bring figs here, asphyxiating
in plastic, for their distant echo
of your humid, ghost-flesh air
shouldering the leaves—that almost-a-human
air—               
            I was born in autumn
as it fled underground
to be fed to a body
of water that only swallows."
Waiting for Your Call,"The light retreats and is generous again.
No you to speak of, anywhere—neither in vicinity nor distance, 
so I look at the blue water, the snowy egret, the lace of its feathers 
shaking in the wind, the lake—no, I am lying. 
There are no egrets here, no water. Most of the time, 
my mind gnaws on such ridiculous fictions. 
My phone notes littered with lines like Beauty will not save you. 
Or: mouthwash, yogurt, cilantro. 
A hummingbird zips past me, its luminescent plumage 
disturbing my vision like a tiny dorsal fin. 
But what I want does not appear. Instead, I find the redwoods and pines, 
figs that have fallen and burst open on the pavement, 
announcing that sickly sweet smell,
the sweetness of grief, my prayer for what is gone. 
You are so dramatic, I say to the reflection on my phone, 
then order the collected novels of Jean Rhys. 
She, too, was humiliated by her body, that it wanted
such stupid, simple things: food and cherry wine, to touch someone. 
On my daily walk, I steal Meyer lemons from my neighbors’ yard, 
a small pomegranate. Instead of eating them, 
I observe their casual rot on the kitchen counter, 
this theatre of good things turning into something else."

Running Water,"translated by Muna Lee
Yes, I move, I live, I wander astray—
   Water running, intermingling, over the sands.
I know the passionate pleasure of motion;
   I taste the forests; I touch strange lands.
Yes, I move—perhaps I am seeking
   Storms, suns, dawns, a place to hide.
What are you doing here, pale and polished—
   You, the stone in the path of the tide?
    ¿Y Tu? 
  Sí, yo me muevo, vivo, me equivoco;
Agua que corre y se entremezcla, siento
El vértigo feroz del movimiento:
Huelo las selvas, tierra nueva toco.
Sí, yo me muevo, voy buscando acaso
Soles, auroras, tempestad y olvido.
¿Qué haces allí misérrimo y pulido?
Eres la piedra a cuyo lado paso."
Journey,"translated by Muna Lee
I met upon the road
A woman and a man,
And a tree that genuflected
Before the wind;
Farther on, a browsing burro;
And farther still, a heap of stone.
And in three thousand leagues of my spirit
There was no more than these:
A tree, a stone, a burro,
A woman, and a man.
    El hastio 
  Encontré por la senda
Una mujer y un hombre,
Y un árbol que al viento
Hacía genuflexiones.
Más lejos un asno que no hacía nada,
Y más lejos una piedra informe...
Y en tres mil leguas de mi espíritu
No había más, entonces,
Que un árbol, una piedra, un asno,
Una mujer y un hombre."
Under the Tuscan Sun (2003): A Romance I̶n̶t̶e̶r̶r̶u̶p̶t̶e̶d̶,"In lieu of a break down, I buy a Tuscan villa  
with what’s left of the alimony.  
The keys I am given are old and because  
I am a novelist, I imagine my past lives  
as the generations that once lived in this house  
and each one of them is white.  
Citizenship goes unsaid; the visa process unsexy,  
taxing, and therefore not worthy  
of a plot line—unlike the man who will teach me  
that after a lengthy divorce I can still orgasm.  
He takes me to Rome—O Roma! I already miss  
the Tuscan fields, where the olive trees are plucked  
by Black hands that were plucked from the Mediterranean,  
and from the road, don’t look like hands  
at all, but like row after fragrant row  
of gnarled branches. Love becomes me in this new city.  
I am always radiant. My body, after all, a vessel  
of history, but I dress it in white, cinched 
at the waist, and no one says a thing. 
I antique shop, never suspecting I could find  
my skull behind glass, just another artifact, price tagged  
and measured, among such fine china. He leaves me of course. 
After all, we’d never survive it; not love or the hours  
long drive between us, but the credits rolling.  
I don’t shed a single tear (I’m lying, enough to flood the piazza).  
Besides, there are many men to take his place, ballads of them.  
Men, who will touch me, their hands staying hands,  
and not blossoming into a rifle, or a colony  
of ants—this is the pinnacle of romance, I’m sure.  
Men, who tell me I have eyes they could drown in.  
Men, who have never been left to die at sea. I want to  
lie naked in their beds—my desire, simple  
and ahistoric—and rename each place they kiss me  
like conquered territory: Giorgio, Marcello,  
Pietro, whose oiled lips at dinner  
could make a blush cross Mary’s porcelain cheeks."
Proof,"I once made a diorama from a shoebox
for a man I loved. I was never a crafty person,
but found tiny items at an art store and did my best
to display the beginning bud of our little love,
a scene recreating our first kiss in his basement
apartment, origin story of an eight-year marriage.
In the dollhouse section, I bought a small ceiling fan.
Recreated his black leather couch, even found miniscule
soda cans for the cardboard counters that I cut and glued.
People get weird about divorce. Think it’s contagious.
Think it dirty. I don’t need to make it holy, but it purifies—
It’s clear. Sometimes the science is simple. Sometimes
people love each other but don’t need each other
anymore. Though, I think the tenderness can stay
(if you want it too). I forgive and keep forgiving,
mostly myself. People still ask, what happened?
I know you want a reason, a caution to avoid, but
life rarely tumbles out a cheat sheet. Sometimes
nobody is the monster. I keep seeing him for the first
time at the restaurant off of West End where we met
and worked and giggled at the micros. I keep seeing
his crooked smile and open server book fanned with cash
before we would discover and enter another world
and come back barreling to this one, astronauts
for the better and for the worse, but still spectacular
as we burned back inside this atmosphere to live
separate lives inside other shadow boxes we cannot see.
I remember I said I hate you once when we were driving
back to Nashville, our last long distance. I didn’t mean it.
I said it to hurt him, and it did. I regret that I was capable
of causing pain. I think it’s important to implicate
the self. The knife shouldn’t exit the cake clean.
There is still some residue, some proof of puncture,
some scars you graze to remember the risk."
Driving,"Monastic firs, marginal, 
    conical, in brooding snoods
a finical sun unpacks, clerical
in scarlet fringe of Interstate scrub.
   Raw nerves.  The fields beyond?
Dun bedsheets long abandoned.
Where is the body in such transit?
   Unclear.  But grief
is ever resurrected.  Sick days
in autumn, child on cot-raft,
   chaste bedroom chary
with red smell of measles, self,
lone bed her book transforms
   to Conestoga wagon:
cold rod of folded, frozen quilt,
two greasy iron pans, menses,
   waste of family crowded
in a space winter’s advance eclipses.
Cathedral silence.  Then door opens
   to a tray, tawny tea, weak as straw.
As whiskey grass, flashing now.  Fleeing past."
Departure,"Oh, my needy pocket, the crooked 
tunnel that is not, in fact,  
a tunnel. You have brought me 
joy. You have brought me. 
Who am I to question? First— 
Chill—Then Stupor—Then 
the evacuation. And  
a man with a stained shirt. 
My legs spread. Are you sure? 
he asked. Yes, I said.  
Will she come back? Will she 
come back? Will she come 
back? Will she come back? Will 
she come back? Will she  
come back? Will she come 
back? Will she come back?  Will
she come back? Will she come 
back? Will she come back?  Will 
she come back? Will she—I 
heard it all—the jar of me.  I put 
on my pants and gave thanks. I 
held my grief like two limp 
tulips. What am I allowed to 
have? I’m still  
here. I’m still hers. I’m  
still a body licked by stars.  
My eyes always drawn  
to the groveling. Bless  
these burnt wings. Bless.  
Would I do it again?  
Yes. Yes. Yes."

Caprice,"translated by Peter H. Goldsmith
Who thankless flees me, I with love pursue,
Who loving follows me, I thankless flee;
To him who spurns my love I bend the knee,
His love who seeks me, cold I bid him rue;
I find as diamond him I yearning woo,
Myself a diamond when he yearns for me;
Who slays my love I would victorious see,
While slaying him who wills me blisses true.
To favor this one is to lose desire,
To crave that one, my virgin pride to tame;
On either hand I face a prospect dire,
Whatever path I tread, the goal the same:
To be adored by him of whom I tire,
Or else by him who scorns me brought to shame.
    Soneto
Prosigue el mismo assumpto, y determina que prevalezca la razon contra el gusto
Al que ingrato me dexa, busco amante;
    al que amante me sigue, dexo ingrata;
    constante adoro, á quien mi amor maltrata;
    maltrato, á quien mi amor busca constante.
Al que trato de amor, hallo diamante,
    y soy diamante, al que de amor me trata;
    triunfante quiero vèr al que me matá,
    y mato á quien me quiere vèr triunfante.
Si á éste pago, padece mi deseo;
    si ruego a aquel, mi pundonor enojo:
    de entrambos modos infeliz me veo.
Pero yo, por mejor partido escojo
    de quien no quiero, ser violento empleo,
    que, de quien no me quiere, vil despojo."
Belt Is Just Another Verb for Song,"“Pain blesses the body back to its sinner”
            —Ocean Vuong
Handcuffs around my wrists 
lined with synthetic fur, my arms bound 
& hoisted, heavenward, as if in praise.
Once, bodies like mine were seen as a symptom
of sin, something to be prayed away;
how once, priests beat themselves to sanctify
the flesh. To put their sins to death. Now,
my clothes scatter across the floor like petals
lanced by hail. Motion stretches objects 
in the eye. A drop of rain remade, 
a needle, a blade. Mark how muscle fiber 
& piano strings both, when struck, ring. 
No music without violence or wind. 
I’ve been searching the backs of lover’s hands
for a kinder score, a pain that makes 
my pain a stranger tune. Still, my body aches 
an ugly psalm. All my bones refuse to harm
-onize. Percussion is our oldest form of song, 
wind bruised into melody. Let me say this plainly:
I want you to beat me 
into a pain that’s unfamiliar. How convenient 
this word, beat, that lives in both the kingdoms 
of brutality & song. The singer’s voice: a cry, 
a moan, god’s name broken across a blade 
of teeth. The riding crop & flog & scourge—
a wicked faith. A blood-loud devotion.  
There is no prayer to save me from my flesh. 
You can’t have the bible without the belt."
Yesterday and To-Day,"translated by Agnes Blake Poor
Prone lies at length the statue once so fair;
   Headless and armless, on the weedy lawn;
Yet still some lovely curve shows here and there
   Through clustering ivy like a mantle drawn.
The cracked, stained pedestal of ages tells.
   From every cranny lined with velvet moss,
The hum of bee, the chirp of cricket swells;
   And silently the lizard darts across.
How long ago, by summer breezes fanned,
   Here stood the newborn Venus, fresh and fair;
All palpitating from the master’s hand,
   The last touch of his chisel lingering there.
“And surely this shall last!” he proudly thought;
   “Fixed in immortal marble is my fame!”
Just here, where human hand has surely wrought,
   Some crumbling letters may have spelled his name.
    Lo que va de ayer á hoy 
  Tendida estaba en el jardín la estatua,
          sin brazos ni cabeza;
y por su talle se enredaba en círculos
          un cinturón de hiedra.
El pedestal poblaban los lagartos,
           los grillos, las abejas;
y del vetusto mármol las heridas
           de moho estaban llenas.
¿Y era aquélla la Venus que brotara 
           de una mano maestra
que, al golpe del cincel, dió forma y vida
           á su bullente idea?
¡Cómo cambia la hoz de las edades
           cuanto á su alcance encuentra!
¡Ayer la carne palpitando en mármol,
           hoy un montón de piedra!"
from “Passage”,"I have come
not to beg nor barter but to enter.
                                                                                                  Who are you seeking?
The past
opens and opens, fleshing me
with loss.
I descend
to find my way,
I who am
haunted and a haunting.
                                                                                                 What are you willing to abandon?
In the before, I continue:
a woman carrying on with the dishes,
the dusting, the sweeping. 
But here, I am the voice of the petitioner.
Dearest, who was once of earth,
Dearest, whose departure has cleft me,
Dearest, who was my country,
my soil, my sun and sky,
every migration 
is a bird taking wing. 
                                                                                                 Is this the place you seek?
And if at last I arrive,
will I find you in that room
with every window like the soul
flung open and flooded
with sounds of the distant sea.
And if I spill
out into the yard, will she be still
there, the child who was me
set down in the grass,
watching the stars blinkering
on and off, their light burning
with the knowledge of death.
                                                                                                  How will you carry this?
I will have to use the flowers to address you.
Wild-blooming frangipani (your cloying scent marks me).
Pointillist-starred ixora (I braid you into my hair).
Indigo-blue plumbago (you obliterate the sky).
Lignum vitae (you foretell all histories).
Roses that grow ragged along the shore (stay with me).
                                                                                                  How will you return to the living?
Called back by the susurrating wind and sea.
Called back by the roots of my hair, dirt
beneath my nails, the body’s sweat and stink.
Called back by their voices, yours
still clenched in my fist. Called back
to all that is matter, bone, and skin,
what fragment of you survives in me
as I open my mouth to speak?"
"Burden, old story.","For starters, each eve is well equipped
with her own apple. The God. Well wrapped
in a cloak of fruit the likes of gold can rip
up ground beneath you, as needed. Look here
beauty. As far as we can tell, it’s never enough.
Ask Eris. Come with gifts like—who you know,
how you get down, access you can offer to more
of them like you. Like ‘Damn you got a sister?’ or
‘Can you bring a couple friends.’ That’s not the whole
of it. What’s pretty is seldom true. Ask Susanna as
Daniel did to get the bottom of it. Trust women.
But who questioned any other than Adam about
the fruit they knew. Or if knowing couldn’t simply
be. an eden. One where someone just admits she took
an apple and in the desert they are rare. For that may
you all suffer. And that is true. And particularly pretty."
Not My Ancestors,"I, heiress of red embers
the fiercest of which burn the uncareful hand
See my one great grandmother what
had the misfortune of disciplining her husband
who thought he could come upside her
head about something or other.
Without missing a beat, she, damn physics,
wield a cast iron pot against his head.
This same short, blunt arm would nurse
twelve children, the youngest only two years 
before her own death. She willed nothing
but her blood. Stout bodied women
with heavy wants and hands, hearts overripe
and prone to leaking. Mama on my grandmother’s side
held a shotgun aimed to the head of any white man 
come up the road. Papa would greet him with one of his own 
just as unfriendly and kind under her sharp shooting eye.
I’ve never held a loaded gun, too afraid I might
turn it on myself. They had Jesus and a wood
burning stove. What do I know about protecting
any body particularly my own? Things inherited,
things learnt, may singed palms pitch to know."
Lover,"Easy light storms in through the window, soft
            edges of the world, smudged by mist, a squirrel’s 
            nest rigged high in the maple. I’ve got a bone 
to pick with whomever is in charge. All year, 
I’ve said, You know what’s funny? and then,
            Nothing, nothing is funny. Which makes me laugh
            in an oblivion-is-coming sort of way. A friend
writes the word lover in a note and I am strangely
excited for the word lover to come back. Come back
            lover, come back to the five and dime. I could 
            squeal with the idea of blissful release, oh lover,
what a word, what a world, this gray waiting. In me,
a need to nestle deep into the safe-keeping of sky.
            I am too used to nostalgia now, a sweet escape
            of age. Centuries of pleasure before us and after
us, still right now, a softness like the worn fabric of a nightshirt
and what I do not say is, I trust the world to come back.
            Return like a word, long forgotten and maligned 
            for all its gross tenderness, a joke told in a sun beam,
the world walking in, ready to be ravaged, open for business."
Bond,"translated by Muna Lee
   I grew
   Only for you.
Cut the acacia boughs that demand
Only destruction at your hand!
   My blossom blew
   Only for you.
Uproot me—in its natal hour
My lily doubted were it candle or flower.
   My waters blue
   Flow for you.
Drink me—never crystal knows
So pure a tide as in this channel flows.
   Wings I knew
   Only for you.
Pursue me! (Quivering firefly,
Veil your flame from every eye!)
I shall suffer for you.
Blessed be the evil that your love will do!
Blessed be the blade, the net I shall feel!
Blessed be thirst and steel!
My heart’s blood will flow
That my love you may know.
What fairer gem, what rarer jewel could be found
Than this offering of a scarlet wound?
Instead of diadems in my hair,
Seven long thorns I shall wear.
Instead of ear-rings I shall don
Two burning coals of vermilion.
When you see me suffering
You will hear my laughter ring.
And you will weep and pity me:
Then more than ever mine you will be.
    El fuerte lazo 
                Crecí
              Para tí.
        Tálame. Mi acacia
Implora a tus manos su golpe de gracia.
              Florí
              Para tí.
        Córtame. Mi lirio
Al nacer dudaba ser flor o ser cirio.
              Fluí
              Para tí.
        Bébeme. El cristal
Envidia lo claro de mi manantial.
              Alas dí
              Por tí.
        Cázame. Falena,
Rodeo tu llama de impaciencia llena.
              Por tí sufriré.
¡Bendito sea el daño que tu amor me dé!
¡Bendita sea el hacha, bendita la red,
Y loadas sean tijeras y sed!
              Sangre del costado
              Manaré, mi amado.
¿Qué broche más bello, qué joya más grata,
Que por tí una llaga color escarlata?
En vez de abalorios para mis cabellos
Siete espinas largas hundiré entre ellos.
Y en vez de zarcillos pondré en mis orejas,
Como dos rubíes dos ascuas bermejas.
              Me verás reír
              Viéndome sufrir.
              Y tú llorarás.
Y entonces... ¡más mío que nunca serás!"
Afroinsularity,"translated from the Portuguese by Shook
They left the islands a legacy
of hybrid words and gloomy plantations,
rusted mills, breathless sterns,
sonorous aristocratic names,
and the legend of a shipwreck on Sete Pedras.
They arrived here from the North,
by mandate or by chance, in the service of their king:
navigators and pirates, slavers, thieves, smugglers,
simple men, rebellious outcasts too, and Jewish infants
so tender they withered like burnt ears of corn.
On their ships they brought compasses, trinkets, seeds,
experimental plants, atrocious sorrows,
a standard of stone pale as wheat,
and other dreamless, rootless cargos,
because the entire island was a port and a dead-end road.
All its hands were black pitchforks and hoes.
And there were living footprints in the fields slashed
like scars—each coffee bush now exhales a dead slave.
And on the islands they were
bold: arrogant statues on street corners,
a hundred or so churches and chapels
for a thousand square kilometers,
and the insurgent syncretism of roadside Christmas shrines.
And there was the palatial cadence of the ússua,
the scent of garlic and zêtê dóchi
on the témpi and ubaga téla,
and in the calulu, bay leaves blended with palm oil
and the perfume of rosemary and of basil from the gardens on our family land.
And the specters, tools of empire,
melted into the insular clocks,
in a structure of ambiguous clarities
and secular condiments,
patron saints and toppled fortresses,
cheap wines and shared dawns.
At times I think of their pallid skeletons,
their hair putrid at the edge of the sea.
Here, in this fragment of Africa
Where, facing the South,
a word rises high
like a painful flag.
    Afroinsularidade
  Deixaram nas ilhas um legado
de híbridas palavras e tétricas plantações,
engenhos enferrujados, proas sem alento,
nomes sonoros aristocráticos
e a lenda de um naufrágio nas Sete Pedras.
Aqui aportaram vindos do Norte,
por mandato ou acaso ao serviço do seu rei:
navegadores e piratas, negreiros, ladrões, contrabandistas,
simples homens, rebeldes, proscritos também, e infantes judeus
tão tenros que feneceram como espigas queimadas
Nas naus trouxeram bússolas, quinquilharias, sementes,
plantas experimentais, amarguras atrozes,
um padrão de pedra pálido como o trigo
e outras cargas sem sonhos nem raizes,
porque toda a ilha era um porto e uma estrada sem regresso.
Todas as mãos eram negras forquilhas e enxadas.
E nas roças ficaram pegadas vivas
como cicatrizes—casa cafeeiro respira agora um escravo morto.
E nas ilhas ficaram
incisivas—arrogantes estátuas nas esquinas,
cento e tal igrejas e capelas
para mil quilómetros quadrados,
e o insurrecto sincretismo dos paços natalícios.
E ficou a cadência palaciana da ússua,
o aroma do alho e do zêtê dóchi
no tempi e na ubaga tela,
e no calulu, o louro misturado ao óleo de palma
e o perfume do alecrim e do mlajincon nos quintais dos luchans.
E aos relógios insulares se fundiram
os espectros—ferramentas do império
numa estrutura de ambíguas claridades
e seculares condimentos,
santos padroeiros e fortalezas derrubadas,
vinhos baratos e auroras partilhadas.
Às vezes penso em suas lívidas ossadas,
seus cabelos podres na orla do mar.
Aqui, neste fragmento de África
onde, virado para o Sul,
um verbo amanhece alto
como uma dolorosa bandeira."
Primordial Mirror,"I was newly naked: aware of myself
as a separate self, distinct from dirt and bone. 
I had not hands enough, 
and so, finally, uncrossed my arms.
In trying to examine one body part, 
I’d lose sight of another. I couldn’t 
imagine what I looked like during 
the fractured angles of sex.
At the river’s edge, it was impossible
to see all of myself at once.
I began to understand nakedness
as a feeling.
It was a snake, loose and green;
it was the snake skin, coiled and discarded.
The shedding chained itself 
like a balloon ribboned to a child’s wrist.
Morning’s birdsong reminded me
of the sloughing off of skin.
The rumored beauty of my husband’s first 
wife never bothered me before.
I missed the sensation of being fixed
in amber. Then the hair in the comb, 
fingernail clippings, the red mole on my
left breast grown suddenly bigger.  
I perceived my likeness in everything:
the lines on my palm as the veins
of a leaf, my mind as a swarm of flies 
humming over something sugary or dead,
my vulnerability as the buck
I’d kill then wrap myself inside, 
my hair as switchgrass, twine, and nest, 
a roving cloud my every limb."

But if I love you what we are is of consequence each to the morning,
each to the afternoon, and to the evening’s retire
But if I love you, time is immeasureable and irrelevant. There is no easy
accounting of the train’s arrival, of the ship’s docking
But if I love you, you are not drawn as an easy other, conscripted
in the agonies of marketed and marketing brands
Arrival and its possibility are verdant present joys
Leaving and its possibilities are expansive desert joys
But if I love you, you are not me,
and we dance along our incongruous, broken roadways
But if I love you, I will love many in the multiple that I am and that I love"
The Maze,"I dislike uncertainty. Take no pleasure in the element of surprise.
I’ll carry the clipboard and checklists around
at my own birthday party. No need to leave anything to chance.
It was my son’s idea of course. There was a plastic pirate out front
and the promise of treasure at the end. I paid, then
shuffled behind, his voice ringing out, follow me—
All glass and mirrors. I saw myself reflected a thousand times
all of them weary, impatient. Some days motherhood is just
din and obstacle. I was thinking about
the letter I had received. Another dead end
in my family search. No contact information, no forwarding address.
No one—no one—had been looking for me.
At a certain point, I stopped trying. Extended my arms and felt
along the walls for edges. It was cheating maybe but plodding along
without pleasure or intent doesn’t get you to the end any faster.
It’s been forty-five years. My mother, my father, they
are not getting any younger. Perhaps I waited too long. Perhaps
if I had started earlier there would have been other options. Other
people to reach out to. I read once in my file that I had
a “very good memory,” that I memorized the names
of all the neighborhood dogs. I would like to know them now.
I saw him before he saw me. He was looking around and pacing
not panicked yet but on the verge. I stopped and watched him for as long
as I thought he could bear. He turned when I emerged at last
and ran up and showed me the flag he had won
for making it through first. You were so slow, he told me. It was so
easy. Next time, don’t take so long."
A Modified Villanelle for My Childhood,"           with some help from Ahmad
I wanna write lyrical, but all I got is magical.
My book needs a poem talkin bout I remember when
Something more autobiographical
Mi familia wanted to assimilate, nothing radical,
Each month was a struggle to pay our rent
With food stamps, so dust collects on the magical.
Each month it got a little less civil
Isolation is a learned defense
When all you wanna do is write lyrical.
None of us escaped being a criminal
Of the state, institutionalized when
They found out all we had was magical.
White room is white room, it’s all statistical—
Our calendars were divided by Sundays spent
In visiting hours. Cold metal chairs deny the lyrical.
I keep my genes in the sharp light of the celestial.
My history writes itself in sheets across my veins.
My parents believed in prayer, I believed in magical
Well, at least I believed in curses, biblical
Or not, I believed in sharp fists, 
Beat myself into lyrical.
But we were each born into this, anger so cosmical
Or so I thought, I wore ten chokers and a chain
Couldn’t see any significance, anger is magical.
Fists to scissors to drugs to pills to fists again
Did you know a poem can be both mythical and archeological?
I ignore the cataphysical, and I anoint my own clavicle."

          17 YEARS OF MATERIAL AID TO MIGRANTS
         —For its daily efforts since 1995, offering free food and drink
         to migrants traveling north on the train known as the Beast,
         the Veracruz women’s group known as Las Patronas has received
         the national Human Rights Award.
                  for Las Patronas, who have more balls than any macho
Storm in La Patrona, Amatlán, Veracruz—
a night lit by oil lamps,
the sun gone down, the electric light gone out,
rain beating its fury against the roof, sheets of water
pounded to shrapnel-clatter—
coffee made from tortillas burnt charcoal-black
and strained through a rag,
nothing but tortillas to ease hunger,
and beans boiled over the fire.
The fire lights up faces, warms the shadows.
The migrants shiver, cups in hand
like little hearth-fires of water,
sugar candle lights for the journey.
They barely speak, they stare at the ground,
at its cracks and crevices, the ash of charred wood
a snow-frost over their feet.
           
The train shakes the earth as it passes,
and roars deep, and kills the last of the sun.
Two Nicaraguans widen their eyes like street cats—
“Tomorrow—we’ll hop the Beast tomorrow—”
Still, they stand up to go.

  17 AÑOS DE AYUDA CONCRETA A LOS MIGRANTES
Por los esfuerzos que implica ofrecer un taco y agua, día a día
desde 1995, sin recibir un peso, a los migrantes que viajan en el tren
conocido como La Bestia, el grupo de mujeres veracruzanas recibe
Premio de Derechos Humanos.
         Para Las Patronas, que tienen más güevos que cualquier gallo
Tormenta en La Patrona, Amatlán, Veracruz.
Es una noche encendida con lámparas de petróleo;
la luz se ha ido—la del sol, la de los cables—.
Riñe con furia la lluvia contra el techo, agua en láminas
vencidas por el tableteo de las metrallas.
Café de tortillas quemadas, negras hasta el carbón,
coladas con un trapo de manta.
No hay más que tortillas para saciar el hambre,
frijoles hervidos con leña.
El fuego ilumina rostros, calienta sombras.
Tiritan los migrantes con tazas en la mano,
pequeñas hogueras de agua, velas de azúcar
para el camino.
Hablan poco, llevan los ojos a la tierra,
a sus grietas, y la ceniza escarcha
los pies con su nieve de madres calcinadas.
Trepida el tren la tierra con sus pasos;
brama profundo, hace morir los restos del sol.
Dos nicas abren las pupilas como salvajes gatos:
“mañana subiremos a La Bestia, mañana”.
Sin embargo, se levantan."
One Night,"translated from the Spanish by Thomas Walsh
The ancient spiders with a flutter spread
   Their misty marvels through the withered flowers,
The windows, by the moonlight pierced, would shed
   Their trembling garlands pale across the bowers.
The balconies looked over to the South;
   The night was one immortal and serene;
From fields afar the newborn springtime’s mouth
   Wafted a breath of sweetness o’er the scene.
How silent! Grief had hushed its spectral moan
   Among the shadowy roses of the sward;
Love was a fable—shadows overthrown
   Trooped back in myriads from oblivion’s ward.
The garden’s voice was all—empires had died—
   The azure stars in languor having known
The sorrows all the centuries provide,
   With silver crowned me there, remote and lone.
    La soledad sonora, XI 
  Las antiguas arañas melodiosas, temblaban
maravillosamente sobre las mustias flores…
sus cristales, heridos por la luna, soñaban
guirnaldas temblorosas de pálidos colores…
   Estaban los balcones abiertos al sur… Era
una noche inmortal, serena y transparente…
de los campos lejanos, la nueva primavera
mandaba, con la brisa, su aliento, dulcemente…
   ¡Qué silencio! Las penas ahogaban su ruído
de espectros en las rosas vagas de las alfombras…
el amor no existía… tornaba del olvido
una ronda infinita de trastornadas sombras…
   Todo lo era el jardín… Morían las ciudades…
Las estrellas azules, con la vana indolencia
de haber visto los duelos de todas las edades,
coronaban de plata mi nostalgia y mi ausencia…"
Masochism of the Knees,"Who is the girl forced to kneel on dried chickpeas to atone for the sin of being alive?
In the dream blindfold and bandage are one.
My hands go numb as I carry dried chickpeas.
In my head there is a voice that says “naked forest” and
“a tiny photograph that is passed between hands in the dark.”
Why doesn’t the girl on the floor of the world talk?
Because she is a wound on the earth’s hide.
Not mouth.
Do you understand?
Wound, not mouth.
 "
Refuge,"In the rain, in her head, an elegy for the not-quite-dead.
Some peonies placed beside her body, supine beneath the canopy of forgotten dreams.
She woke in such a state, such a state that she had to take shelter from the beloved's rain beneath a tree.
It rained so hard she didn't know where she was.
I don’t like being left to myself like this."
Life is a Place Where it's Forbidden to Live,"All I remember is the coppiced terrain I crossed to find a house to rest in. Who is the woman lurking in the woods? A fellow traveler. I'm not used to seeing others. She is lost and I am lost but the difference is she is a novice at being lost, whereas I have always been without country. Without planet. When we happen upon a cabin I ask the house for shelter on her behalf. I'm aware that we come off as oogles but want to prove we are different by washing dishes. To concretize my gratitude. 
In the morning, before the others awake, I set off for the holy site in a horse-drawn carriage. The carriage has a detachable sleeping chamber designed so that a princely man can carry me supine whenever the horse gets tired. 
At sunset my pilgrimage is complete. The Asian market is a glass palace overlooking an airport. From outside the Palace of Snacks the products shine like organs inside a hard, translucent skin. As I take the palace escalator heavenward my eyes are fixed on an airplane parked on the runway. 
It is waiting for me. "
Life As We Know it,"The scientists say fungi are more closely related to animals—to us—
than multicellular plants. The truth: the shiitake in your fridge
             would treat you better than half the men in the bar tonight,
and it’d taste better too.
I won’t cry when the Anthropocene ends.
             Instead, I’ll breathe in the spores and thank God.
You’re calling it the apocalypse,
and I tell you that it means lifting the veil—
I tell you this thing is ancient—a revelation. This is the last orgasm.
             It’s Eternity. Soft skulls of mushrooms are pushing up
             through our pores
and I’m whispering to you that they’re loving us like men would—
             eating us raw, sucking on our bones, marrying our bodies—
             only, this is better than men.
             But when the mycelium fills my mouth, and I can no longer
             breathe, I want to tell you how
             you remind me of the moon; to hold your hand;
             to let you know
I’m still here, but this
             is inescapable.
You’re looking at me with eyes that ask
             if this is the end, but I think:
This feels like
             coming home."

"The Thing of Nature That Defies or Defers, Rather Than Presupposes, Representation","I’m cool standing, we say to the studio chaise’s cooling board ambition. The photographer sets for a fruitless still life. Attempted portraits of us are inclined to landscape orientation. It isn’t that we’d fish-eye the lens, but that some eyes’ lenses insist something fishy. The shutterbug keeps on checking that the camera’s uncapped. We get it, we get it: though is it we be constricting light, or vacay it to rich space? Photog cocks a new angle, bent on composing what rubatos composure and composition. The kamera kalkulates us as low light; seems we might be a dim holt, in a damp hull, or a damned hole (in it or itself). Though is it we (who) be conscripting eyes, or melee them to sic race? And-a-one, two, three: say cheese! We say life, inclined to insist on checking that constricting, bent low might (damned in itself—sick, too). This very teeming skeeves some, its accommodation of objects into a body, its embodiment of objecthood, we are actor and scene—the frame only part of the production. We quit the sitting, since the work to our living’s an off-camera oeuvre. That surveillance produces the nothing it suspects we are. Please don’t throw me in that periphery, says the rabbit figment."

with cool caresses."
A Song of the Road,"translated by John Pierrepont Rice
The way was black,
The night was mad with lightning; I bestrode
My wild young colt, upon a mountain road.
And, crunching onward, like a monster’s jaws,
His ringing hoof-beats their glad rhythm kept,
Breaking the glassy surface of the pools,
Where hidden waters slept.
A million buzzing insects in the air
On droning wing made sullen discord there.
But suddenly, afar, beyond the wood,
Beyond the dark pall of my brooding thought,
I saw lights cluster like a swarm of wasps
Among the branches caught.
“The inn!” I cried, and on his living flesh
My broncho felt the lash and neighed with eagerness.
And all this time the cool and quiet wood
Uttered no sound, as though it understood.
Until there came to me, upon the night,
A voice so clear, so clear, so ringing sweet—
A voice as of a woman singing, and her song
Dropped like soft music winging, at my feet,
And seemed a sigh that, with my spirit blending,
Lengthened and lengthened out, and had no ending.
And through the empty silence of the night,
And through the quiet of the hills, I heard
That music, and the sounds of the night wind bore me,
Like spirit voices from an unseen world
Came drifting o’er me.
I curbed my horse, to catch what she might say:
“At night they come, and they are gone by day—”
And then another voice, with low refrain,
And untold tenderness, took up the strain:
“Oh love is but an inn upon life’s way”;
“At night they come, and they are gone by day—”
Their voices mingled in that wistful lay.
Then I dismounted and stretched out my length
Beside a pool, and while my mind was bent
Upon that mystery within the wood,
My eyes grew heavy, and my strength was spent.
And so I slept there, huddled in my cloak.
And now, when by untrodden paths I go,
Through the dim forest, no repose I know
At any inn at nightfall, but apart
I sleep beneath the stars, for through my heart
Echoes the burden of that wistful lay:
“At night they come, and they are gone by day,
And love is but an inn upon life’s way.”
  La canción del camino
a Alfredo Gómez Jayme.
   Era un camino negro.
La noche estaba loca de relámpagos. Yo iba
En mi potro salvaje
Por la montaña andina.
Los chasquidos alegres de los cascos,
Como masticaciones de monstruosas mandíbulas
Destrozaban los vidrios invisibles
De las charcas dormidas.
Tres millones de insectos
Formaban una como rabiosa inarmonía.
   Súbito, allá, a lo lejos,
Por entre aquella mole doliente y pensativa
De la selva,
Vi un puñado de luces como un tropel de avíspas.
¡La posada! El nervioso
Látigo persignó la carne viva
De mi caballo, que rasgó los aires
Con un largo relincho de alegría.
   Y como si la selva
Lo comprendiese todo, se quedó muda y fría.
   Y hasta mí llegó, entonces,
Una voz clara y fina
De mujer que cantaba. Cantaba. Era su canto
Una lenta… muy lenta… melodía:
Algo como un suspiro que se alarga
Y se alarga y se alarga… y no termina.
   Entre el hondo silencio de la noche
Y a través del reposo de la montaña, oíanse
Los acordes
De aquel canto sencillo de una música íntima,
Como si fuesen voces que llegaran
Desde la otra vida..
   Sofrené mi caballo;
Y me puse a escuchar lo que decía:
   —Todos llegan de noche,
Todos se van de día…
   Y formándole dúo,
Otra voz femenina
Completó así la endecha
Con ternura infinita:
   —El amor es tan sólo una posada
En mitad del camino de la Vida.
   Y las dos voces, luego,
a la vez repitieron con amargura rítmica:
   —Todos llegan de noche,
Todos se van de día…
   Entonces, yo bajé de mi caballo
Y me acosté en la orilla
De una charca.
  Y fijo en ese canto que venía
A través del misterio de la selva,
Fui cerrando los ojos al sueño y la fatiga.
Y me dormí, arrullado; y, desde entonces,
Cuando cruzo las selvas por rutas no sabidas,
Jamás busco reposo en las posadas;
Y duermo al aire libre mi sueño y mi fatiga,
Porque recuerdo siempre
Aquel canto sencillo de una música íntima:
   —Todos llegan de noche,
Todos se van de día.
El amor es tan sólo una posada
En mitad del camino de la Vida…"
The Carillon,"translated from the Spanish by Garrett Strange
I love them—and I hearken
   As the winds their notes prolong,
Like the murmur of a fountain,
   Like a lambkin’s distant song,
Like the birds serenely winging
   On their way across the skies,
At the break of daylight soaring
   To salute it with their cries.
In their voices saying ever
   O’er the plain and mountain peak
Something that is frank and candid
   That a soothing charm would speak.
Should their voices cease forever,
   What a sorrow for the air!
What a silence in the belfries!
   And the dead—how strangely bare!
  Las Campanas
    Yo las amo, yo las oigo
Cual oigo el rumor del viento,
El murmurar de la fuente
O el balido del cordero.
    Como los pájaros, ellas,
Tan pronto asoma en los cielos
El primer rayo del alba,
Le saludan con sus ecos.
    Y en sus notas, que van repitiéndose
Por los llanos y los cerros,
Hay algo de candoroso,
De apacible y de halagüeño.
    Si por siempre enmudecieran,
¡Qué tristeza en el aire y el cielo!,
¡Qué silencio en las iglesias!,
¡Qué extrañeza entre los muertos!"
Silueta of Crushed Lipstick and Mum Petals,"I heard you in the garden
& I was afraid I was naked so I hid.
  I was naked because  I was afraid
—I said to myself.
  Vox gone hidden in the imbecile garden.
In the traffic I hid me.
  Fear smells mineral, petroleum, sumac, rain-lustered.
I drink the drams from its awe-silver limbs.
  I heard your voice purpling like bellies of Peruvian
blues at various depths in soil. Away-from.
  Artificial lights, they leave the leafy
night looking icy in unfinished colors.
  I heard you say magenta:
three syllables swarming out the voice box.
  Swarm brings back no mauvish/cyan/crimson
to your sightline but some tv snow.
  A needle dragging skin-dust long the vinyl
grooves. Music acquires you in iotas.
  As static I heard you whirling around the vinyl-
dark round & round—
  Adrenaline alters the hide, hair.
I was afraid of the paradise in my ear."

my sorrows like fitted

[Know thou well this world its state...],"translated by C. E. Biddulph
Know thou well this world its state, what is, is; what is not, is not:
Whether Rake or Devotee, what is, is; what is not, is not.
Whether much or little thine, count it all as passed away;
Be thou of the Prophet’s nature, for what is, is; what is not, is not.
If for life thou grievest, what cause if thyself thou knowest;
Alive to thy grave thou goest, what is, is; what is not, is not.
Of sea and land the Monarch thou, if wet and dry alike thou countest;
Be thou then the Monarch of the age, for what is, is; what is not, is not.
Whether pearls or jewels, whether flowers or trees,
Take no account of all, for what is, is; what is not, is not.
Ill thy wishes, bad thy actions, causeless grief and envy thine;
In patience be thou wealthy, for what is, is; what is not, is not.
Weep thou not, nor yet rejoice; leave alike both grief and joy;
Be acquainted with this secret, what is, is; what is not, is not.
Alas! what though it collects, with no one does it here remain:
Of gold and silver be thou free, for what is, is; what is not, is not.
Of thy loved one seek for kindness, and thou find it not, then weep:
Do thou as thy loved one wills thee, for what is, is; what is not, is not.
Whether Union or Separation, to me they both are all alike:
Be thou at ease as thou art, for what is, is; what is not, is not.
Why dost thou strive and struggle, and day and night art full of concern?
Be thou the same whatever betide, for what is, is; what is not, is not.
Short is life, and many its troubles; why so anxious in your heart?
Be thou satisfied with wet or dry, for what is, is; what is not, is not.
Consider thou thy special talent, while alive make good use of it,
O Khush-hal! a Lion be thou, for what is, is; what is not, is not."

On Lombard street in Philadelphia, as evening dropped to earth, I gazed upon a laborer duskier than a sky devoid of moon. He was seated on a throne of flour bags, waving his hand imperiously as two small boys played on their guitars the ragtime tunes of the day. 
God’s blessing on the monarch who rules on Lombard Street in Philadelphia."

For Henry’s Bar,"I’m on an errand to find my grandpa. I’m ten
and finding freedom in a sanctioned outing
on my bike through the streets of Clovis, CA.
I roll past Silver’s house and peek into the backyard
of broke drunks holding paper bags around
a barrel fire. One who just came back
from taking a leak is seasoning some carne
they bought with the tallboys across the street
at Numero Uno market. The door chimes when
I walk in and see Artemio’s white mane. His mustache
stretches from his nostrils to his sideburns
and up into his waxed pomp of hair.
My grandma says I’m not supposed to talk to him,
but he always asks how she’s doing.
I don’t see my grandpa anyplace. Art says
he’s around somewhere. I go to Ruby’s
next door. I’m not allowed, but I look in.
I’m hit with a gust of cigarettes and Bud Light.
Half a dozen heads turn my direction. No dice.
I ride down Pollasky with feet out each way.
I swerve left and right, free, for once. I am this
far from the shouting distance of my grandma.
I take to the alley just for kicks and pop a wheelie
behind the appliance shop. I pull up behind Henry’s,
knowing grandpa’s in there. A few other grandpas too.
I don’t knock. I stay on my bike. I realize
I’m not ready to go home and like most men
in this town, grandpa doesn’t want to be found.
I keep riding. I go North toward what’s left
of the railroad tracks. There’s a grey cloud
moving across the sky and I imagine I’m
chasing it, I’m right behind it. I keep riding
until it’s all oleanders and stacked railroad ties.
I never thought I could go this far. I get off
the seat and stand. I glide next to a forgotten
caboose. I imagine I’m the howling train now.
My tires kick dust as they crunch over the dry dry dirt."
A Distant Song,"Whether awake or sleeping,
   I cannot rest for long:
By my casement comes creeping
  A distant song.

A song like the chiming of silver
  Bells which the breezes play,
Seeming to float for ever
  Towards an unseen day:

A song that is weary with sorrow,
  Yet knows not any defeat:
Through the past, through to-day, through to-morrow,
  It echoes on life’s long street.

Could I but make words of its power,
  Bring it from the future here,
Men’s souls would be waking, that hour,
  To the victory against fear.

But the vague sweet stanza befools me
  With its calm joy, time after time,
And no failure here ever schools me
  To cease from an idle rhyme.

That music afar, unspoken,
    ’Tis I have done it wrong:
I caught, and I have broken,
    A distant song. "
Promise,"Through the moil and the gloom they have issued
    To the steps of the upwinding hill, 
Where the sweet, dulcet pipes of tomorrow
    In their preluding rhapsodies trill.
With a thud comes a stir in the bosom,
    As there steals on the sight from afar,
Through a break of a cloud’s coiling shadow
    The gleam of a bright morning star!"
Night Festival," To reach the night festivities I press against the celebrants

speak?
will poetry speak?
I want to scream
My throat is dry
My throat, silenced so long, is coarse
In books I see that word I can’t pronounce
In the faces of my friends
Hiding in women’s bathrooms
(My grandmother was a seamstress in the factories
After the War of the Pacific she was widowed with five children)
will poetry speak up?
Let me tell you about the light burning
                                                     my breast
That clouds my dreams
Whose lace stays caught in my throat
Factories made of sounds
Factories made of mute women
Factories made of gazes
From when the sun comes up until I return home
I carry that word inside me
And if poetry spoke
what would it be? how?
Would it be able to tell of her rage?
  NN3
¿hablar?
¿hablará la poesía?
Yo quiero gritar
Tengo la garganta seca
La garganta áspera de tanto estar callada
En los libros veo esa palabra que no puedo pronunciar
En las caras de mis compañeras
Escondidas en los baños para mujeres
(Mi abuela fue costurera en las fábricas
Después de la guerra del Pacífico viuda con 5 hijos)
¿hablará la poesía?
Déjame hablarte de la luz que me quema
                                                    el pecho
Esa que nubla mis sueños
Esa cuyos encajes quedan atrapados en mi garganta
Fábricas de sonidos
Fábricas de mujeres mudas
Fábricas de miradas
Desde que sale el sol hasta que llego a casa
Llevo esa palabra dentro
Y si la poesía hablara
¿qué sería? ¿cómo?
¿Podrá decir su rabia?"
Margo,"Can she be planted where the corner of the garden’s rocks are down?
I would like bleeding heart or fuchsia to redden the banks
In their brief seasons. Rain, rain, Irish rain.
Diamonds on the stamens when the sun goes blind.
And sweet pea, pale pink, pale blue, perfume.
Please, if you can, make sure there is an ash tree, young and tight and green.
And bring back the smell of turf for the burning. Of her. Of me."
French Leave,"No servile little fear shall daunt my will
  This morning, I have courage steeled to say
I will be lazy, conqueringly still,
  I will not lose the hours in toil this day.
The roaring world without, careless of souls,
  Shall leave me to my placid dream of rest,
My four walls shield me from its shouting ghouls,
  And all its hates have fled my quiet breast.
And I will loll here resting, wide awake,
  Dead to the world of work, the world of love,
I laze contented just for dreaming’s sake,
  With not the slightest urge to think or move.
How tired unto death, how tired I was!
  Now for a day I put my burdens by,
And like a child amidst the meadow grass
  Under the southern sun, I languid lie,
And feel the bed about me kindly deep,
  My strength ooze gently from my hollow bones,
My worried brain drift aimlessly to sleep,
  Life soften to a song of tuneful tones."
The Office Building,"We kissed there in the stone entrance,
In the great cool stone mouth of the building,
Before it took you.
We kissed under the granite arches.
And then you turned and were gone
And high about and above were the hard towered walls,
The terrible weights of stone, relentless,
But for the moment they had been kind to us,
Folding us with arms
While we kissed."
Audience,"for Becca
I don’t know anything about the structure of rocks. 
Only that I move them 
away from where they were 
to another location 
closer in proximity
to me. Collecting rocks is a habit 
backed in desire. I suppose I trust 
that my desire is true, 
although I have doubted it
as I’ve doubted all sorts of love—
material attachment to objects 
and object relations. 
Mother for example. First best friend. 
The poster from a museum 
possessed by gaze and gender 
seen in a country
I now call to question, taken
by a photographer, of a model 
mid-gesture, combing straight black hair 
over white powdered 
left shoulder, bare breasts.  
A thin instance of stark relation
black  white, curve  line. My doubt 
has caused me to be more discerning, 
but not to stop. My eyes scour the shore. 
I found one this summer that made me think of you, 
pink and bone and speckled with beige and grey. 
Then pink again and always a bit yellow, 
like the sun, or like your hair 
which is a thing as you know,
in and of itself 
something that tells people 
something about your town.
In the discernment era
of rock pick up
I look closely to decide 
if the rock I’ve chosen will speak itself 
when dried and dried completely.
(Unlike my snails it won’t smell.)
I doubt my new method, 
as I have doubted so many loves. 
The rock may be dull—
yours is the love altar. 
It’s oblong. It’s unlike rocks 
I usually collect 
with longing 
vaguely resembling a heart."

             all that is always unseen, 
I believe in my mother, daughter of Dr. and Mrs. Pulmano, 
             who dreamed an American dream, 
             who suffered barely making ends meet, 
             who suffered giving everything unto everyone, 
             who suffered, died, and was buried;

Confessional to Famous Iranian Pop Singer Dariush,"~Dariush was imprisoned before the Islamic Revolution for what he refers to as his deep beliefs.
Sitting in the pews as a boy, I told the time by how hot my tongue became, 
my mouth clamped shut, the coolness of my toothpaste faded as the morning faded. 
I bent over my book. There was something too clean about this. 
The old white faces peering out like suns, the sheen
of robes hovering near the altar. Rows of people presenting themselves, 
a fish market. I never could skip the sex scenes in my book, one hand a shield 
to the cross—I never could remember 
their names no matter what I did—my other hand stayed 
cold. The stiffness at my crotch. My standing for communion. Failing 
to catch the eye of the teenage acolyte with her candle, I worried I’d be a virgin for
the rest of my life. And I always wished I could dance. Like Elvis 
like Michael. Humiliated by the body. Humiliated by my stepmother wanting me to believe
in something, anything. At least sing the hymns. Believe in something, believe,
I urged myself. My great-grandfather the devout Muslim 
would clean his hands incessantly before prayer, or so my mother 
wrote. I never knew him. When my great-grandfather died, he was surrounded
by a pool of his own filth. Shamed, she said in Persian— 
the word for shame and embarrassment synonymous, the light through stained glass  
imagined light. I practice Jackson’s moves 
in my mirror. For a year I take hip-hop lessons. I try to break-
dance. I realize too late it is a solo act. I am bullied mercilessly. I learn 
from the boys in my class that dancing is gay. I hate 
the spotlight. My family in Iran has dance parties. My grandparents send
videos. I think their arms looked like samaras, whirligigs, wingtips weaving in
and out of one another’s airflow. I felt joyful. I felt 
betrayed by everyone. I wanted to disappear in the pew with my book. The smell of wax, 
like a steaming cup of water, the breath of my
father singing hymns, the melt. I liked to watch the people stand and sit and
kneel and stand, their prayers foaming at the lip, pulsing, mouth open at release."
The Drowsy World Dreams On,"A flower bloomed out on a woodland hill,
A song rose up from the woodland rill;
But the floweret bloomed but to wither away,
And no man heard what the stream had to say,
  For the drowsy world dreamed on.
Thro the frills of a curtain a moonbeam crept,
Till it fell on the crib where a nursling slept;
And a whisper and smile lit a wee dimpled face,
But none save the angels their beauty could trace,
  For the drowsy world dreamed on.
A wee bird piped out mid the corn,
A rose bloomed out beneath the thorn;
But the scent of the rose and the birdling’s lay
On the winds of the morning were wafted away
  While the drowsy world dreamed on.
And the drowsy old world’s growing gloomy and gray,
While the joys that are sweetest are passing away;
And the charms that inspire like the picture of dawn
Are but playthings of Time—they gleam and are gone,
    While the drowsy world dreams on. "
Summer Sorrow,"What shall meadow hold to please me,
Spreading wide its scented waving,
How shall quiet mosses ease me, 
Or the night-wind cool my craving?
Hill and hedgerow, cloud-sweet sky, 
Echo our good-by.
Bud unplucked and leaf a-quiver,
Bird that lifts a tuneless trilling,
Restless dream of brook and river,
All June’s cup a wasted spilling—
You and I so thirsty-hearted!—
Summer knows us parted."

Soonisms,"Healed by a microscope, the angel burns my missing son's hair
in the mirror's 
invisible stomach. 
I am in the blue school of that first shooting. 
Ohio radio treats fatigue as an error from sleep's past.
Art is a moon rock in a gun shop 
And death
God's refusal
to age."
To Winter,"Stay, season of calm love and soulful snows!
There is a subtle sweetness in the sun,
The ripples on the stream’s breast gaily run,
The wind more boisterously by me blows,
And each succeeding day now longer grows.
The birds a gladder music have begun,
The squirrel, full of mischief and of fun,
From maples’ topmost branch the brown twig throws.
I read these pregnant signs, know what they mean:
I know that thou art making ready to go.
Oh stay! I fled a land where fields are green
Always, and palms wave gently to and fro,
And winds are balmy, blue brooks ever sheen,
To ease my heart of its impassioned woe."
Spring in New Hampshire (To J. L. J. F. E.),"Too green the springing April grass,
         Too blue the silver-speckled sky,
For me to linger here, alas,
         While happy winds go laughing by,
Wasting the golden hours indoors,
Washing windows and scrubbing floors.
Too wonderful the April night,
         Too faintly sweet the first May flowers,
The stars too gloriously bright,
         For me to spend the evening hours,
When fields are fresh and streams are leaping,
Wearied, exhausted, dully sleeping."
work: an ode for the human micropoem*,"one has to have
a reason for living
a guiding philosophy
a purpose
a goal
the best way
to communicate
an idea
is to act it out
no work
no eat
i want to have something to say
about my own destiny
something i care about
something of value
something important
*Coda: The Human Micropoem is a call and response choral form. It amplifies the speaker’s words by those listening. The poet says a line aloud and then everyone repeats it. Micropoeming was collectively devised by Chicago writers during the Occupy Movement of 2011. We continue to perform together in public spaces and hold the words of others in our mouths."
Winter in the Country,"Sweet life! how lovely to be here
         And feel the soft sea-laden breeze
Strike my flushed face, the spruce's fair
         Free limbs to see, the lesser trees'
Bare hands to touch, the sparrow's cheep
         To heed, and watch his nimble flight
Above the short brown grass asleep.
         Love glorious in his friendly might,
Music that every heart could bless,
         And thoughts of life serene, divine,
Beyond my power to express,
         Crowd round this lifted heart of mine!
But oh! to leave this paradise
         For the city's dirty basement room,
Where, beauty hidden from the eyes,
         A table, bed, bureau and broom
In corner set, two crippled chairs
         All covered up with dust and grim
With hideousness and scars of years,
         And gaslight burning weird and dim,
Will welcome me . . . And yet, and yet
         This very wind, the winter birds,
The glory of the soft sunset,
         Come there to me in words."
On a Primitive Canoe,"Here, passing lonely down this quiet lane,
Before a mud-splashed window long I pause
To gaze and gaze, while through my active brain
Still thoughts are stirred to wakefulness; because
Long, long ago in a dim unknown land,
A massive forest-tree, ax-felled, adze-hewn,
Was deftly done by cunning mortal hand
Into a symbol of the tender moon.
Why does it thrill more than the handsome boat
That bore me o'er the wild Atlantic ways,
And fill me with rare sense of things remote
From this harsh life of fretful nights and days?
I cannot answer but, whate'er it be,
An old wine has intoxicated me."
I Shall Return,"I shall return again; I shall return
To laugh and love and watch with wonder-eyes
At golden noon the forest fires burn,
Wafting their blue-black smoke to sapphire skies.
I shall return to loiter by the streams
That bathe the brown blades of the bending grasses,
And realize once more my thousand dreams
Of waters rushing down the mountain passes.
I shall return to hear the fiddle and fife
Of village dances, dear delicious tunes
That stir the hidden depths of native life,
Stray melodies of dim remembered runes.
I shall return, I shall return again,
To ease my mind of long, long years of pain."
Enslaved,"Oh when I think of my long-suffering race,
For weary centuries despised, oppressed,
Enslaved and lynched, denied a human place
In the great life line of the Christian West;
And in the Black Land disinherited,
Robbed in the ancient country of its birth,
My heart grows sick with hate, becomes as lead,
For this my race that has no home on earth.
Then from the dark depths of my soul I cry
To the avenging angel to consume
The white man's world of wonders utterly:
Let it be swallowed up in earth's vast womb,
Or upward roll as sacrificial smoke
To liberate my people from its yoke!"
Serenity,"The storms that break and sweep about my feet,
The winds that blow and tear, the rains that fall,
Shall not the courage of my soul appall;
I shall be conqueror, tho’ sore defeat
O’erwhelm the outbound keels of all my fleet
Of dreams; tho’ not one tattered sail, but all
Go down mid sea; with heart serene, I’ll greet
The worst or best, the stronger for the squall.
My soul is set amid the storms of life,—
The hurricanes of passion crash and break
And tides of heathen hate sweep o’er our land;
But calm amid the flying ruins of strife,
Or in the leaping flames around the stake
With pierced hands—my faith serene,—I stand!"
Exile,"I have made grief a gorgeous, queenly thing,
And worn my melancholy with an air.
My tears were big as stars to deck my hair,
My silence stunning as a sapphire ring.
Oh, more than any light the dark could fling
A glamour over me to make me rare,
Better than any color I could wear
The pearly grandeur that the shadows bring.
What is there left to joy for such as I?
What throne can dawn upraise for me who found
The dusk so royal and so rich a one?
Laughter will whirl and whistle on the sky—
Far from this riot I shall stand uncrowned,
Disrobed, bereft, an outcast in the sun."
Gradually Then Suddenly,"Flowers a dull pink and out of stories. 
The clown in the middle of town
dances but only when the streetlights
go blank. Children puff through
the window in a way that makes their faces
an inner god. I have all these chairs
I cannot use. Only the belonging
they beg for. Consider a dead oven
then consider freedom. A heavy kite
could touch Jupiter if Jupiter existed.
Any child could become a swan 
song. It doesn’t take long to weather."
Vows,"I’ve been cradling the heavy cat in the half-dark
For an hour 
She likes how I make her feel 
And I like her— 
I was mean to the dog 
And now he’s dead 
Well, not mean 
Cold in moments 
He could have used the warmth 
I could tell and still did nothing about it
And so here I am 
Paying— 
Which I am accustomed to 
And anyhow I am happy 
To pay for such horrors, such ill manners
Of my character 
Even if I do blame you for it— 
How can I empathize with anything 
When I can’t remember empathy 
And you are the only mountain 
For miles all around 
I’ve had to learn to be kind again 
To uncoil my tendrils into the light 
Sometimes I pretend you are not a person
But a stone (how could I love
people again, if I didn’t?) 
And I warn them: Little Ones, 
Don’t learn from stones
They are too still
They are too sharp
Sometimes in the moonlight 
They whisper terrible things"
When I Have Passed Away,"When I have passed away and am forgotten,
         And no one living can recall my face,
When under alien sod my bones lie rotten
         With not a tree or stone to mark the place;
Perchance a pensive youth, with passion burning,
         For olden verse that smacks of love and wine,
The musty pages of old volumes turning,
         May light upon a little song of mine,
And he may softly hum the tune and wonder
         Who wrote the verses in the long ago;
Or he may sit him down awhile to ponder
         Upon the simple words that touch him so."
Heritage,"Now the dead past seems vividly alive,
         And in this shining moment I can trace,
Down through the vista of the vanished years,
         Your faun-like form, your fond elusive face.
And suddenly some secret spring’s released,
         And unawares a riddle is revealed,
And I can read like large, black-lettered print,
         What seemed before a thing forever sealed.
I know the magic word, the graceful thought,
         The song that fills me in my lucid hours,
The spirit’s wine that thrills my body through,
         And makes me music-drunk, are yours, all yours.
I cannot praise, for you have passed from praise,
         I have no tinted thoughts to paint you true;
But I can feel and I can write the word;
         The best of me is but the least of you."
"December, 1919","Last night I heard your voice, mother,
The words you sang to me
When I, a little barefoot boy,
Knelt down against your knee.
And tears gushed from my heart, mother,
And passed beyond its wall,
But though the fountain reached my throat
The drops refused to fall.
'Tis ten years since you died, mother,
Just ten dark years of pain,
And oh, I only wish that I
Could weep just once again."
In Bondage,"I would be wandering in distant fields
Where man, and bird, and beast, lives leisurely,
And the old earth is kind, and ever yields
Her goodly gifts to all her children free;
Where life is fairer, lighter, less demanding,
And boys and girls have time and space for play
Before they come to years of understanding—
Somewhere I would be singing, far away.
For life is greater than the thousand wars
Men wage for it in their insatiate lust,
And will remain like the eternal stars,
When all that shines to-day is drift and dust
But I am bound with you in your mean graves,
O black men, simple slaves of ruthless slaves."

The Life of a Writer,"the life of a writer is desire

tears rushing towards the chin

the knives of my fingers tap

admittedly, i am foolish 
            about love—a simple yes excites me—

like water meets the tongue. it’s scary

My Mountains,"translated by Ursula K. Le Guin
In mountains I grew up, 
three dozen peaks around me. 
I seem never, never, 
though I hear my steps departing, 
to have lost them, not in the day, 
not in the starlit night, 
and though in pools I see
myself with snowy hair, 
I never left them, they never left me
like a child forsaken. 

And though they might call me
runaway, deserter, 
I had them and I have them 
always, always. 
And their gaze follows me. 
  Montañas Mías 
  En montañas me crié
con tres docenas alzadas.    
Parece que nunca, nunca,
aunque me escuche la marcha,
las perdí, ni cuando es día
ni cuando es noche estrellada,
y aunque me vea en las fuentes
la cabellera nevada,
las dejé ni me dejaron
como a hija trascordada.
Y aunque me digan el mote
de ausente y de renegada,
me las tuve y me las tengo
todavía, todavía,
y me sigue su mirada."
Chile’s Land,"translated by Ursula K. Le Guin
     Let’s dance on the land of Chile, 
lovely as Rachel, as Leah, 
the land that breeds a people
sweet of heart and speech. 

     The greenest land with gardens, 
the fairest land with wheat, 
the reddest land with vineyards, 
the gentlest to our feet! 

    Our laughter’s made of its rivers, 
our cheeks of its dusty earth. 
Kissing the feet of the dancers
it groans like a mother in birth. 

    It’s beautiful, and for its beauty
we’ll dance its fields along, 
it’s free, and for its freedom
we’ll drench its face in song. 

    Tomorrow we’ll hew and quarry, 
tend to the trees and plants, 
   tomorrow we’ll build the cities, 
today just let us dance! 
  Tierra Chilena 
     Danzamos en tierra chilena,
más bella que Lía y Raquel;
la tierra que amasa a los hombres
de labios y pecho sin hiel...
    La tierra más verde de huertos,
la tierra más rubia de mies,
la tierra más roja de viñas,
¡qué dulce que roza los pies!
    Su polvo hizo nuestras mejillas,
su río hizo nuestro reír,
y besa los pies de la ronda
que la hace cual madre gemir.
   Es bella, y por bella queremos
sus pastos de rondas albear;
es libre y por libre deseamos
su rostro de cantos bañar...
   Mañana abriremos sus rocas,
la haremos viñedo y pomar;
   mañana alzaremos sus pueblos;
¡hoy sólo queremos danzar!"
I Sing What You Loved,"translated from the Spanish by Ursula K. Le Guin
   Life of my life, what you loved I sing.
If you're near, if you’re listening,
remembering earth, in the evening,
my life, my shadow, hear me sing.

   Life of my life, I can’t be still.
What is a story we never tell?
How can you find me unless I call?

   Life of my life, I haven’t changed,
not turned aside and not estranged.
Come to me as the shadows grow long,
come, life of my life, if you know the song
you used to know, if you know my name.
I and the song are still the same.

    Beyond time or place I keep the faith.
Follow a path or follow no path, 
don’t fear the night or the rainy wind.
call me to come to you, now at the end,
and come to me, soul of my soul, my friend. 
 
Canto Que Amabas 
  Yo canto lo que tú amabas, vida mía,
por si te acercas y escuchas, vida mía,
por si te acuerdas del mundo que viviste,
al atardecer yo canto, sombra mía.
Yo no quiero enmudecer, vida mía.
¿Cómo sin mi grito fiel me hallarías?
¿Cuál señal, cuál me declara, vida mía?
Soy la misma que fue tuya, vida mía.
Ni lenta ni trascordada ni perdida.
Acude al anochecer, vida mía;
ven recordando un canto, vida mía,
si la canción reconoces de aprendida
y si mi nombre recuerdas todavía.
Te espero sin plazo ni tiempo.
No temas noche, neblina ni aguacero.
Acude con sendero o sin sendero.
Llámame a donde tú eres, alma mía,
0201y marcha recto hacia mí, compañero."
Give Me Your Hand,"translated by Ursula K. Le Guin
Give me your hand and give me your love,
give me your hand and dance with me.
A single flower, and nothing more,
a single flower is all we'll be.

Keeping time in the dance together,
singing the tune together with me, 
grass in the wind, and nothing more,
grass in the wind is all we'll be.

I'm called Hope and you're called Rose:
but losing our names we'll both go free,
a dance on the hills, and nothing more,
a dance on the hills is all we'll be.
Dame La Mano 
Dame la mano y danzaremos;
dame la mano y me amarás.
Como una sola flor seremos,
como una flor, y nada más.

El mismo verso cantaremos,
al mismo paso bailarás.
Como una espiga ondularemos,
como una espiga, y nada más.

Te llamas Rosa y yo Esperanza;
pero tu nombre olvidarás,
porque seremos una danza
en la colina y nada más. "
Weaving the Round,"translated by Ursula K. Le Guin
    Where shall we go to weave the round?
Shall we go down to the ocean beach?
The sea'll dance in a thousand waves
to make us an orange-blossom wreath. 

Shall we go where the hills come down? 
The mountains are going to answer, 
as if every stone in the world
started singing and dancing. 

Even better, let's go to the woods: 
voice will wreathe together with voice,
songs of children, songs of birds
meeting and kissing on the breeze! 

Making the round, the endless round, 
we'll go to the woods to twine the wreath, 
and weave it wherever the hills come down
and along the beaches of all the seas. 
 
¿En Dónde Tejemos La Ronda? 
  ¿En dónde tejemos la ronda?
¿La haremos a orillas del mar?
El mar danzará con mil olas
haciendo una trenza de azahar.
¿La haremos al pie de los montes?
El monte nos va a contestar.
¡Será cual si todas quisiesen,
las piedras del mundo, cantar!
¿La haremos, mejor, en el bosque?
La voz y la voz va a trenzar,
y cantos de niños y de aves
se irán en el viento a besar.
¡Haremos la ronda infinita!
¡La iremos al bosque a trenzar,
la haremos al pie de los montes
y en todas las playas del mar!"
The Spanish Needle,"Lovely dainty Spanish needle
         With your yellow flower and white,
Dew bedecked and softly sleeping,
         Do you think of me to-night?
Shadowed by the spreading mango,
         Nodding o'er the rippling stream,
Tell me, dear plant of my childhood,
         Do you of the exile dream?
Do you see me by the brook's side
         Catching crayfish 'neath the stone,
As you did the day you whispered:
         Leave the harmless dears alone?
Do you see me in the meadow
         Coming from the woodland spring
With a bamboo on my shoulder
         And a pail slung from a string?
Do you see me all expectant
         Lying in an orange grove,
While the swee-swees sing above me,
         Waiting for my elf-eyed love?
Lovely dainty Spanish needle,
         Source to me of sweet delight,
In your far-off sunny southland
         Do you dream of me to-night?"
My Mother,"I
Reg wished me to go with him to the field,
I paused because I did not want to go;
But in her quiet way she made me yield
Reluctantly, for she was breathing low.
Her hand she slowly lifted from her lap
And, smiling sadly in the old sweet way,
She pointed to the nail where hung my cap.
Her eyes said: I shall last another day.
But scarcely had we reached the distant place,
When o'er the hills we heard a faint bell ringing;
A boy came running up with frightened face;
We knew the fatal news that he was bringing.
I heard him listlessly, without a moan,
Although the only one I loved was gone.
II
The dawn departs, the morning is begun,
The trades come whispering from off the seas,
The fields of corn are golden in the sun,
The dark-brown tassels fluttering in the breeze;
The bell is sounding and the children pass,
Frog-leaping, skipping, shouting, laughing shrill,
Down the red road, over the pasture-grass,
Up to the school-house crumbling on the hill.
The older folk are at their peaceful toil,
Some pulling up the weeds, some plucking corn,
And others breaking up the sun-baked soil.
Float, faintly-scented breeze, at early morn
Over the earth where mortals sow and reap—
Beneath its breast my mother lies asleep."
Sunset,"Since Poets have told of sunset, 
What is left for me to tell?
I can only say that I saw the day
Press crimson lips to the horizon gray, 
And kiss the earth farewell."
The River Village,"Translated by Florence Ayscough and Amy Lowell
The river makes a bend and encircles the village with its current.
All the long Summer, the affairs and occupations of the river village are quiet and simple.
The swallows who nest in the beams go and come as they please.
The gulls in the middle of the river enjoy one another, they crowd together and touch one another.
My old wife paints a chess-board on paper.
My little sons hammer needles to make fish-hooks.
I have many illnesses, therefore my only necessities are medicines.
Besides these, what more can so humble a man as I ask?"
The One Mockingbird Only Sings at Night,"Far cars, numerous.
Lullaby (by a lull)
and I pretend (I-10 as ocean).
And dream (DNA remade)
and dream. Maker
(remake me), better me
this time.
And wake
to a chorus of one
courting through
alarms, beeping,
trilling silver, song.
Mating call after call
(no answers, no takers).
And now it collects more
and further from nature.
Desperate thing (who is the pitied?),
what did you think would happen

Harlem Shadows,"I hear the halting footsteps of a lass
         In Negro Harlem when the night lets fall
Its veil. I see the shapes of girls who pass
         To bend and barter at desire's call.
Ah, little dark girls who in slippered feet
Go prowling through the night from street to street!
Through the long night until the silver break
         Of day the little gray feet know no rest;
Through the lone night until the last snow-flake
         Has dropped from heaven upon the earth's white breast,
The dusky, half-clad girls of tired feet
Are trudging, thinly shod, from street to street.
Ah, stern harsh world, that in the wretched way
         Of poverty, dishonor and disgrace,
Has pushed the timid little feet of clay,
         The sacred brown feet of my fallen race!
Ah, heart of me, the weary, weary feet
In Harlem wandering from street to street."
The Wild Goat,"O you would clothe me in silken frocks
         And house me from the cold,
And bind with bright bands my glossy locks,
         And buy me chains of gold;
And give me—meekly to do my will—
         The hapless sons of men:—
But the wild goat bounding on the barren hill
         Droops in the grassy pen."
Interior,"In the house that is my body
a Black girl waves at the world
from her window. She can be 
safe here because the house
is cis assumed. I want to keep us 
& keep us safe, even if it means
I am cis assumed. My phantom
breasts that aren’t phantom breasts
but A-cups. I get so sick of them
not seeing the girl. I get so scared
they might see the girl. Safe 
derives from the Old French sauf
meaning protected, watched-
over, assured of salvation.
I am the watchtower for the girls
& their salvation. Let’s hear it for
the girls. About the invention of Black
femmes, is this what Spillers meant?
Am I? In the watchtower that is my body,
there is a door that leads to a legion
of ungone femmes. It’s safe inside
the girl for the others to stay."
A Fairy Tale of Blackboyhood,"When I say Black, what I mean is the curl of my hair is tight enough to snag the teeth of a wide-tooth comb. So, I don’t comb my hair when I’m in the comfort of my home. This comfort is the standard by which I determine who, what, where is home. I rarely feel home in my father’s home.
▪
When I was 21, my father kissed my forehead and this was the first time he ever kissed me. My father’s lips recall a different story. But this is my tale of a boy whose hard head grew tender from his father’s kiss. The words I love you, boy seeped into my newly-softened skull. For just a moment, my father returned my boyhood so he could feel the gratification of kissing his son goodnight. It had to be that way.
▪
The only way to rake my hair into a neat brush of manageable coils is to first wet it thoroughly. Before I leave my home, I sometimes—most times—tame my hair with water to allow it to floss the teeth of the comb, to bear the brunt of its bite. I sometimes long for watered-down brown tresses that know to bow to the comb’s might. I sometimes wish my hair would grow into an impenetrable forest, endless and black as starless nights.
▪
When I say Black, I mean my father’s hardened bosom has left me disheartened—desensitized to all but the snatch of a fine-tooth comb. I’ve been taught a man must be made a boy before he can receive a kiss from another man, and such ancient magic must be sparingly used. Sometimes—most times—I sleep with one eye open and hope to reunite with the strange magician who makes boys of men with forehead kisses. On these nights, I lie in bed and wait for him to cast his spell. As I sleep, my father combs his fingers through my hair and plants his lips on my eager forehead. On these nights, I wake floating above my bed in boyish bliss. On these nights, I feel home."
After the Winter,"Some day, when trees have shed their leaves
         And against the morning's white
The shivering birds beneath the eaves
         Have sheltered for the night,
We'll turn our faces southward, love,
         Toward the summer isle
Where bamboos spire to shafted grove
         And wide-mouthed orchids smile.
And we will seek the quiet hill
         Where towers the cotton tree,
And leaps the laughing crystal rill,
         And works the droning bee.
And we will build a cottage there
         Beside an open glade,
With black-ribbed blue-bells blowing near,
         And ferns that never fade."
The Plateau,"It was the silver, heart-enveloping view
         Of the mysterious sea-line far away,
         Seen only on a gleaming gold-white day,
That made it dear and beautiful to you.
And Laura loved it for the little hill,
         Where the quartz sparkled fire, barren and dun,
         Whence in the shadow of the dying sun,
She contemplated Hallow's wooden mill.
While Danny liked the sheltering high grass,
         In which he lay upon a clear dry night,
         To hear and see, screened skilfully from sight,
The happy lovers of the valley pass.
But oh! I loved it for the big round moon
         That swung out of the clouds and swooned aloft,
         Burning with passion, gloriously soft,
Lighting the purple flowers of fragrant June."
Poem for Rebecca Wight,"Inside a valley 
arranged in tableau—once, 
my hidden year, 
no one noticed we lay down 
in grass & leaves 
where later I buried 
my letter, where I wrote 
how it was.
Do you remember 
the coil of a literal phone line, 
print of a body’s missing 
breath. It’s hard to write 
the ancient years 
when you are midlife 
as a creek running 
hills of hardwoods. 
A hollow 
of her face 
off the forested 
page & all the books 
we read to find ourselves 
unseen. Who drew you 
a thousand grieving seeds."
I let the flies bite me when I meditate,"because I am a blood abundance
and it is said that when you yield an amplitude
it is right to give
of the surplus
and who among us would not bring forth
a teardrop of hemoglobin
if it would feed a starving beggar
and who among us could not afford 
to spare a raindrop in the flash flood
O I saith unto thee, 
it is this abundance 
which hath bowed our backs
this bounty—
like a price 
on our heads,
which hang—
but here have come
mine guardian angels
to alight upon me
and banquet,
to sit at meat
and to make my burden
light"
"Mary, Mother of Christ","That night she felt those searching hands
Grip deep upon her breast,
She laughed and sang a silly tune
To lull her babe to rest;
That night she kissed his coral lips
How could she know the rest?"
The Wise,"(For Alain Loch) 
Dead men are wisest, for they know
How far the roots of flowers go,
How long a seed must rot to grow.
Dead men alone bear frost and rain
On throbless heart and heatless brain,
And feel no stir of joy or pain.
Dead men alone are satiate;
They sleep and dream and have no weight,
To curb their rest, of love or hate.
Strange, men should flee their company,
Or think me strange who long to be
Wrapped in their cool immunity."
Suicide Chant,"I am the seed
    The Sower sowed;
I am the deed
    His hand bestowed
Upon the world.
Censure me not
    If a rank weed flood
The garden plot,
    Instead of a bud
To be unfurled.
Bridle your blame
    If the deed prove less
Than the bruited fame
    With which it came
From nothingness.
The seed of a weed
    Cannot be flowered,
Nor a hero's deed
    Spring from a coward.
Pull up the weed;
    Bring plow and mower;
Then fetch new seed
    For the hand of the Sower. "
Spring Reminiscence,"""My sweet,"" you sang, and, ""Sweet,"" I sang,
    And sweet we sang together,
Glad to be young as the world was young,
    Two colts too strong for a tether.
Shall ever a spring be like that spring,
    Or apple blossoms as white;
Or ever clover smell like the clover
    We lay upon that night?
Shall ever your hand lie in my hand,
    Pulsing to it, I wonder;
Or have the gods, being jealous gods,
    Envied us our thunder?"
Wild May,"Aleta mentions in her tender letters,
Among a chain of quaint and touching things,
That you are feeble, weighted down with fetters,
And given to strange deeds and mutterings.
No longer without trace or thought of fear,
Do you leap to and ride the rebel roan;
But have become the victim of grim care,
With three brown beauties to support alone.
But none the less will you be in my mind,
Wild May that cantered by the risky ways,
With showy head-cloth flirting in the wind,
From market in the glad December days;
Wild May of whom even other girls could rave
Before sex tamed your spirit, made you slave."
North and South,"O sweet are tropic lands for waking dreams!
         There time and life move lazily along.
There by the banks of blue-and-silver streams
         Grass-sheltered crickets chirp incessant song,
Gay-colored lizards loll all through the day,
         Their tongues outstretched for careless little flies,
And swarthy children in the fields at play,
         Look upward laughing at the smiling skies.
A breath of idleness is in the air
         That casts a subtle spell upon all things,
And love and mating-time are everywhere,
         And wonder to life's commonplaces clings.
The fluttering humming-bird darts through the trees
         And dips his long beak in the big bell-flowers,
The leisured buzzard floats upon the breeze,
         Riding a crescent cloud for endless hours,
The sea beats softly on the emerald strands—
O sweet for quiet dreams are tropic lands!"
August Moonrise,"The sun was gone, and the moon was coming
Over the blue Connecticut hills;
The west was rosy, the east was flushed,
And over my head the swallows rushed
This way and that, with changeful wills.
I heard them twitter and watched them dart
Now together and now apart
Like dark petals blown from a tree;
The maples stamped against the west
Were black and stately and full of rest,
And the hazy orange moon grew up
And slowly changed to yellow gold
While the hills were darkened, fold on fold
To a deeper blue than a flower could hold.
Down the hill I went, and then
I forgot the ways of men,
For night-scents, heady, and damp and cool
Wakened ecstasy in me
On the brink of a shining pool.
O Beauty, out of many a cup
You have made me drunk and wild
Ever since I was a child,
But when have I been sure as now
That no bitterness can bend
And no sorrow wholly bow
One who loves you to the end?
And though I must give my breath
And my laughter all to death,
And my eyes through which joy came,
And my heart, a wavering flame;
If all must leave me and go back
Along a blind and fearful track
So that you can make anew,
Fusing with intenser fire,
Something nearer your desire;
If my soul must go alone
Through a cold infinity,
Or even if it vanish, too,
Beauty, I have worshipped you.
Let this single hour atone
For the theft of all of me."
Life,"              1
A moment of pleasure,
    An hour of pain,
A day of sunshine,
    A week of rain,
A fortnight of peace,
  A month of strife,
These taken together
  Make up life. 
              2
One real friend
    To a dozen foes,
Two open gates,
  ’Gainst twenty that’s closed,
Prosperity’s chair,
    Then adversity’s knife;
These my friends
    Make up life.
              3
At daybreak a blossom,
    At noontime a rose,
At twilight ’tis withered,
    At evening ’tis closed.
The din of confusion,
    The strain of the fife,
These with other things
    Make up life.
              4
A smile, then a tear,
    Like a mystic pearl,
A pause, then a rush
    Into the mad whirl,
A kiss, then a stab
  From a traitor’s knife;
I think that you’ll agree with me, 
    That this life."
French Toast,"ah my mother used to make it
with eggs and milk
and stale white bread
slid onto a plate with
Log Cabin fake maple syrup
and I always wanted more
to disappear what troubled me
the man under the moon
the man in our living room
make enough spitting bacon
to forget the broken gameboards
splintered bat
missing family car
his vanishings and sudden returns
smelling of other rooms
my mother’s tears
over the stove
her catchy milky breath"
Copernicus,"You are always in the middle of the poem
even at the end.
More and more you are tied by ropes,
foliage, and as you move
the bindings grow around your knees, your feet.
Again and again you pass
your own footprints on the grass, on floors,
once more you have tracked mud into the house.
Have tracked a house into the mud. Outside the poem
are sirens, fires, ocean hitting
pier. Say to yourself: does not cohere
but is subsumed
and must not, must not. Outside the poem
a little vein clicks in the forehead of a financier,
a cue called, an oboe,
truncheons, pigeons, rain
mineralizes a colonnade. 
A chorale stands up, taller than a building,
false in sense, numerically true.
You despise these techniques.
You have not got to the truth yet.
A truck downshifts on the freeway,
a shift whistle blows,
someone else’s emergency makes the poem hold.
At night, like notes pushed under doors,
sounds come in––
flypaper in an open window,
your mother rubbing lotion on her hands.
All this is with you, is you,
runs after you into the dark
like those men after Copernicus,
like a planet chased by telescopes into space."
a feeling has passed before a charted present,"I wanted to write a book that was like lying down.
            —Bhanu Kapil
a feeling has passed before a charted present
a possibly expired desire
a replacement of Whitman’s body with his opposite
a polite vengeance
a presumed minor literature
a simile not in force
a yoking of the concrete
a myth makes
a body subject to forces not legislated to pass over a same
a memory uncertain about a sentence
a certain observation of an indefinite object
a response barely stands
a sentence only to signal an unwritten
a demand for a law barring its passage and end
a tapeworm, a pinworm, a hookworm, a threadworm
a fluke a sentence wants never to end"
Bread and Wine,"From death of star to new star's birth,
    This ache of limb, this throb of head,
This sweaty shop, this smell of earth,
    For this we pray, ""Give daily bread.""
Then tenuous with dreams the night,
    The feel of soft brown hands in mine,
Strength from your lips for one more fight
    Bread's not so dry when dipped in wine."
Sacrament,"She gave her body for my meat,
    Her soul to be my wine,
And prayed that I be made complete
    In sunlight and starshine.
With such abandoned grace she gave
    Of all that passion taught her,
She never knew her tidal wave
    Cast bread on stagnant water."
Caprice,"""I’ll tell him, when he comes,"" she said,
    ""Body and baggage, to go,
Though the night be darker than my hair,
    And the ground be hard with snow.""
But when he came with his gay black head
    Thrown back, and his lips apart,
She flipped a light hair from his coat,
    And sobbed against his heart."
Advice to Youth,"(For Guillaume) 
Since little time is granted here
    For pride in pain or play,
Since blood soon cools before that Fear
    That makes our prowess clay,
If lips to kiss are freely met,
    Lad, be not proud nor shy;
There are no lips where men forget,
    And undesiring lie."
Taking Your Olympic Measure,"—Poetry was an Olympic event from 1912-1948.
Think of the records you have held:
For one second, you were the world’s youngest person.
It was a long time ago, but still.
At this moment, you are living 
In the farthest thousandth-of-a-second in the history of time.
You have beaten yesterday’s record, again.
You were perhaps the only participant,
But in the race to get from your bedroom to the bathroom, 
You won.
You win so much, all the time in all things.
Your heart simply beats and beats and beats—
It does not lose, although perhaps one day.
Nevertheless, the lists of firsts for you is endless—
Doing what you have not done before,
Tasting sake and mole, smelling bergamot, hearing
Less well than you used to—
Not all records are for the scrapbook, of course—
Sometimes you are the best at being the worst.
Some records are secret—you know which ones.
Some records you’re not even aware of.
In general, however, at the end of a long day, you are—
Unlikely as it may seem—the record holder of note.  "
XX Judgement,"In a graveyard, Pluto issues out its banner
Stark with god’s red cross telling me what I already know.
From now on, debts and love now have measure.
A hard candy for every time I punched my brother.
A soured apple for every missed dinner at my mother’s table.
A ray of night cuts through the light and I am alone again
in a bed ever shrinking to the size I allow myself.
I eat the apples and pucker further into my bound shape.
I crack the hard candies that glue themselves to my crowns;
A bitter nourishment weighs in my belly
While everything I have done now curdles:
the price of action. All my solace unravels as a feast."
To One Who Said Me Nay,"This much the gods vouchsafe today:
    That we two lie in the clover,
Watching the heavens dip and sway,
    With galleons sailing over.
This much is granted for an hour:
    That we are young and tender,
That I am bee and you are flower,
    Honey-mouthed and swaying slender.
This sweet of sweets is ours now:
    To wander through the land,
Plucking an apple from its bough
    To toss from hand to hand.
No thing is certain, joy nor sorrow,
    Except the hour we know it;
Oh, wear my heart today; tomorrow
    Who knows where the winds will blow it?"
If You Should Go,"Love, leave me like the light,
    The gently passing day;
We would not know, but for the night,
    When it has slipped away.
Go quietly; a dream,
    When done, should leave no trace
That it has lived, except a gleam
    Across the dreamer's face."
"Oh, for a Little While Be Kind","(For Ruth Marie)
Oh, for a little while be kind to me
      Who stand in such imperious need of
        you,
And for a fitful space let my head lie
Happily on your passion's frigid breast.
Although yourself no more resigned to me
Than on all bitter yesterdays I knew,
This half a loaf from sumptuous crumbs
        your shy
Reneging hand lets fall shall make me blest.
The sturdy homage of a love that throws
Its strength about you, dawn and dusk, at bed
And board, is not for scorn. When all is said
With final amen certitude, who knows
But Dives found a matchless fragrance fled
When Lazarus no longer shocked his nose?"
All the Dead,"Priest and layman, virgin, strumpet,
    Good and ill commingled sleep,
Waiting till the dreadful trumpet
    Separates the wolves and sheep."
Order,"I hear you wake before I’m up myself
and snap to ready now before my eyes
crack from their crud to face your face today.
I hear you blunder toward my door. I hear
you crash it wide. The loosened hinges shiver
their frame, and now the house itself, awake
to the world and you, complicit, pulls me hard
as thunder from my sleep. You beat the echoes
to me, blear-faced, awash with night sweat; 
you drag a bunny by the ears to bed
and tumble graceless up the mattress, silent,
a drowsy rocket wanting, wanting something
I’m not awake enough to understand
but will be, soon, my son, and then we’ll go
to blaze the day, to stomp each puddle left
by the rain you never notice as you pull
me into the world, all leap and bowl, all grab
and fall. Today I’ll wake up better, call
the distance order, order it to be
a smaller thing. I’ll stand to make it so."
Earth Evanescent,"If other planets dark as earth
About dim trembling stars
Carry frail freight of death and birth,
Wild love, and endless wars;

If from far, unseen motes in flight
Life look down questioning
This helpless passage through the night
Is a less lonely thing:

But if unchained through empty space
Drift only shell and fire
What seeks the beauty of this face,
What end has its desire?

A candle in a night of storms,
Blown back and choked with rain,
Holds longer than the mounting forms
That ride time’s hurricane."
Meditations at Tabexa Wakpa (Frog Creek),"I.
We have taken the long highway home again. The grass is tall,
cobwebs and the husks of yellow jackets ornament the basement.
While we were away our neighbor and friend who always invited us over
for salmon and potatoes died in his sleep on the couch.
Two healthy babies have been born, twins and nephews.
Someone broke in through a window downstairs–
took three televisions, two star quilts, a Pendleton shawl, the chainsaw
and one large bottle of laundry detergent.
They smoked cigarettes on the couch and drank pop from the fridge.
II.
The way the horizon bends itself around 
our lives here might make us think 
we are exceptional. Walking the giant plain, 
wind-drenched, we found the fox kits 
we had been watching the previous summer.
Small bodies at the bottom of the open well. 
Probably at play, lost their bearings, 
and still too young to know any better.
III.
Almost as ghosts, we come and go from this place, not at all 
like the known spirits who reside here, some at tranquil rest, others– 
one man died who died here fifty years ago poisoned his young wife
and raised their newborn son in a neglectful and angry home.
The boy grew up neglected and angry and killed his father.
Oh, the sum of these moments and our own, atoms and particles in constant motion.
Peel back their stratum, hang them on the clothesline in the breeze.  
Let their shadow shapes build nests finally out in the open."
"Heart Butte, Montana","The unsympathetic wind, how she has evaded me for years now,
leaving a guileless shell and no way to navigate.  Once when I stood
on a plateau of earth just at the moment before the dangerous,
jutting peaks converged upon the sway of grasslands, I almost
found a way back.  There, the sky, quite possibly all the elements,
caused the rock and soil and vegetation to congregate.  Their prayer
was not new and so faint I could hardly discern.  Simple remembrances,
like a tiny, syncopated chorus calling everyone home:  across
a thousand eastward miles.  And what little wind was left at my back.
I could not move and then the music was gone.
All that was left were the spring time faces of mountains, gazing down,
their last patches of snow, luminous.  I dreamed of becoming snow melt,
gliding down the slope of history and in to the valley.  With the promise,
an assurance, that there is always a way to become bird, tree, water again. "
"The Book of the Missing, Murdered and Indigenous—Chapter 1","The winding cord of highways, unkempt
gravel roads and the trails of animals—
a record of who and what has passed over,
an agony of secrets.
In the end, they have all borne witness,
eyes like glass beads that can never blink.
The dull light of motel neon shines ominously.
An engine growls across the landscape.
Brittle men who are splintered like glass
thrown from a second story window
and we are the room they leave behind.
They are pathetic husks, feeble in spirit.
Fragments fall along fields and shallow ditches,
in overlooked alleyways or underpasses.
A cold, empty breeze rising from the debris.
The first and last moment of her.
It is rage that pulls her up from this place.
She spews out the wretched and miserable
as particles of dawn-lit soil illuminate her skin.
Her hair is a two-edged sword.
She stitches together the collective story of origin,
her body a map: descended from the stars,
on the backs of animal sisters,
carried to safety in a bird’s beak."
Memory,"Sweet memory, like a pleasing dream,
    Still lends a dull and feeble ray;
For ages with her vestige teems,
    When beauty's trace is worn away.
When pleasure, with her harps unstrung,
    Sits silent to be heard no more,
Or leaves them on the willows hung,
    And pass-time glee forever o'er;

Still back in smiles thy glory steals
    With ev'ning dew drops from thine eye;
The twilight bursting from thy wheels,
    Ascends and bids oblivion fly.
Memory, thy bush prevails to bloom,
    Design'd to fade, no, never, never,
Will stamp thy vestige on the tomb,
    And bid th' immortal live forever.

When youth's bright sun has once declined
    And bid his smiling day expire,
Mem'ry, thy torch steals up behind,
    And sets thy hidden stars on fire."
Homing Swallows,"Swift swallows sailing from the Spanish main,
         O rain-birds racing merrily away
From hill-tops parched with heat and sultry plain
         Of wilting plants and fainting flowers, say—
When at the noon-hour from the chapel school
         The children dash and scamper down the dale,
Scornful of teacher's rod and binding rule
         Forever broken and without avail,
Do they still stop beneath the giant tree
         To gather locusts in their childish greed,
And chuckle when they break the pods to see
         The golden powder clustered round the seed?"
Hope is a Bruise,"Paintball pellets batter shoulders
and thighs at 190 miles per hour
I count the purplish bruises and
smile at the post vision of us toasting
laughing, being vibrantly alive
The woman who pierced my nose
Rushed outside afterwards for a cigarette
Whether my nostril or her nerves were to blame
We both survived an ordeal that day
I don’t think of the sweat on her lip 
or the tears on my cheek when my jeweled 
Black nose disrupts canonical spaces
Agony delineates child bearing from child rearing
Pain is the anticipated toll: the impossible stretch of skin and orifice,
wrenching of organs, the pinch and nip of nursing
I received no pamphlets about the pangs of panic and impotence
The deep marrow rupture when their ache explodes beyond your reach
A formation of police fired rubber bullets at my child
200 feet per second in defense of hatred and spiteful ignorance
She raged back in protest until her throat rasped, her heels
blistered and she shattered into sobs once safe in our home, in my arms
They gassed and maced my baby. She marched again the next day.
And the next and the next and the next and the next
Hope is a bruise, a nervous smoke and an unrelenting calvary"
Bitter Winter,"Forgiveness hangs flimsy between you
and the raw truth you've come to know:
Resentments do come home to roost, to peck, to force you
into navigating fatherhood from your knees. There are
explosives undetonated on your tongue, tasting
like guilt, goddamn and gunpowder all swirled together
You teach yourself to swallow, to repent, to deny the
flames licking from your chest. Arms crossed, she bids you a bitter winter.
 "
Young Singer,"One who sings “chansons vulgaries”
In a Harlem cellar
Where the jazz-band plays
From dark to dawn
Would not understand
Should you tell her
That she is like a nymph
For some wild faun."
Winter Moon,"How thin and sharp is the moon tonight!
How thin and sharp and ghostly white
Is the slim curved crook of the moon tonight!"
Cabaret,"Does a jazz-band ever sob?
They say a jazz-band’s gay.
Yet as the vulgar dancers whirled
And the wan night wore away,
One said she heard the jazz-band sob
When the little dawn was grey."
Shadows,"We run,
We run,
We cannot stand these shadows!
Give us the sun.
We were not made
For shade,
For heavy shade,
And narrow space of stifling air
That these white things have made.
We run,
Oh, God,
We run!
We must break through these shadows,
We must find the sun."
Poem [1],"For the portrait of an African boy after the manner of
                                   Gauguin
All the tom-toms of the jungles beat in my blood.
And all the wild hot moons of the jungles shine in my
        soul.
I am afraid of this civilization—
        So hard,
                So strong,
                        So cold."
For Myself,"What’s in this grave is worth your tear;
    There's more than the eye can see;
Folly and Pride and Love lie here
    Buried alive with me."
For Joseph Conrad,"Not of the dust, but of the wave
His final couch should be;
They lie not easy in a grave
Who once have known the sea.
How shall earth's meagre bed enthrall
The hardiest seaman of them all?"
For Paul Laurence Dunbar,"Born of the sorrowful of heart,
    Mirth was a crown upon his head;
Pride, kept his twisted lips apart
    In jest, to hide a heart that bled."
"For Hazel Hall, American Poet","Soul-troubled at the febrile ways of breath,
Her timid breast shot through with faint alarm,
“Yes, I'm a stranger here,” she said to Death,
“It's kind of you to let me take your arm.”"
Landscape with a Hundred Turns,"When you turned into a hundred rooms,
I returned each month as a door
that opened only one.
When you turned into a hundred rooms
the wind flung through
each of them wailing
and left a hundred songs
in hopes you would return for it
and me and
once, finding a doe locked up,
the trees blued up
the mountain pass, I understood
you had transformed into your multiple,
as the rain is different
each step from the moon. Sleeping
in a hundred rooms, a hundred dreams
of you appear—though by day
your voice has frozen into standing stones.
When you turned into a hundred rooms,
I met with a mirror in each eye
your growing absence.
When I moved, the shadows without you
followed me. In the hundred rooms,
I cannot pick one,
for each combines into the other
where I piece-by-piece the shadows
you have ceased
to remember. As the rain
is different each day of the year,
when I turned for you
and hoped you’d return to me,
was it I who left
and you who remained the same?
For when you changed,
I changed
the furniture in the rooms.
A hundred birds flew over a hundred fields.
A mountain flowed into a hundred rivers
then ended.
In a hundred rooms,
I turned and turned,
hoping to return to you.
O, the chrysanthemums grew
in the hundred rooms!
Far in the past and far in the future
were those numinous and echoing stars."
Monotony,"Today like yesterday
Tomorrow like today;
The drip, drip, drip,
        Of monotony
Is wearing my life away;
Today like yesterday,
Today like today. "
Justice,"That Justice is a blind goddess
Is a thing to which we black are wise:
Her bandage hides two festering sores
That once perhaps were eyes"
A Black Pierrot,"I am a black pierrot:
        She did not love me,
        So I crept away into the night
        And the night was black, too.
I am a black pierrot:
        She did not love me,
        So I wept until the red dawn
        Dripped blood over the eastern hills
        And my heart was bleeding, too.
I am a black pierrot:
        She did not love me,
        So with my once gay colored soul
        shrunken like a balloon without air,
        I went forth in the morning
        To seek a new brown love."
When Sue Wears Red,"When Susanna Jones wears red
her face is like an ancient cameo
Turned brown by the ages.
Come with a blast of trumpets,
       Jesus!
When Susanna Jones wears red
A queen from some time-dead Egyptian night
Walks once again.
Blow trumpets, Jesus!
And the beauty of Susanna Jones in red
Burns in my heart a love-fire sharp like a pain.
Sweet silver trumpets,
       Jesus!"
Song for a Banjo Dance,"Shake your brown feet, honey,
Shake your brown feet, chile,
Shake your brown feet, honey,
Shake ’em swift and wil’–
    Get way back, honey,
    Do that low-down step.
    Walk on over, darling,
        Now! Come out
        With your left.
Shake your brown feet, honey,
Shake ’em, honey chile.
Sun’s going down this evening–
Might never rise no mo’.
The sun’s going down this very night–
Might never rise no mo’–
So dance with swift feet, honey,
    (The banjo’s sobbing low)
Dance with swift feet, honey–
    Might never dance no mo’.
Shake your brown feet, Liza,
Shake ’em, Liza, chile,
Shake your brown feet, Liza,
    (The music’s soft and wil’)
Shake your brown feet, Liza,
    (The banjo’s sobbing low)
The sun’s going down this very night–
Might never rise no mo’."
Beggar Boy,"What is there within this beggar lad
That I can neither hear nor feel nor see,
That I can neither know nor understand
And still it calls to me?
Is not he but a shadow in the sun —
A bit of clay, brown, ugly, given life?
And yet he plays upon his flute a wild free tune
As if Fate had not bled him with her knife!"
After Many Springs,"Now,
In June,
When the night is a vast softness
Filled with blue stars,
And broken shafts of moon-glimmer
Fall upon the earth,
Am I too old to see the fairies dance?
I cannot find them any more."
Danse Africaine,"The low beating of the tom-toms,
The slow beating of the tom-toms,
       Low . . . slow
       Slow . . . low —
       Stirs your blood.
               Dance!
A night-veiled girl
       Whirls softly into a
       Circle of light.
       Whirls softly . . . slowly,
Like a wisp of smoke around the fire —
       And the tom-toms beat,
       And the tom-toms beat,
And the low beating of the tom-toms
       Stirs your blood."
On Broadway,"About me young and careless feet
Linger along the garish street;
         Above, a hundred shouting signs
Shed down their bright fantastic glow
         Upon the merry crowd and lines
Of moving carriages below.
Oh wonderful is Broadway—only
My heart, my heart is lonely.
Desire naked, linked with Passion,
Goes strutting by in brazen fashion;
         From playhouse, cabaret and inn
The rainbow lights of Broadway blaze
         All gay without, all glad within;
As in a dream I stand and gaze
At Broadway, shining Broadway—only
My heart, my heart is lonely."
Home Thoughts,"Oh something just now must be happening there!
That suddenly and quiveringly here,
Amid the city's noises, I must think
Of mangoes leaning o'er the river's brink,
And dexterous Davie climbing high above,
The gold fruits ebon-speckled to remove,
And toss them quickly in the tangled mass
Of wis-wis twisted round the guinea grass;
And Cyril coming through the bramble-track
A prize bunch of bananas on his back;
And Georgie—none could ever dive like him—
Throwing his scanty clothes off for a swim;
And schoolboys, from Bridge-tunnel going home,
Watching the waters downward dash and foam.
This is no daytime dream, there's something in it,
Oh something's happening there this very minute!"
"For John Keats, Apostle of Beauty","Not writ in water, nor in mist,
    Sweet lyric throat, thy name;
Thy singing lips that cold death kissed
    Have seared his own with flame."
For One Who Died Singing of Death,"He whose might you sang so well
    Living, will not let you rust:
Death has set the golden bell
    Pealing in the courts of dust."

The Tropics in New York,"Bananas ripe and green, and ginger-root,
         Cocoa in pods and alligator pears,
And tangerines and mangoes and grape fruit,
         Fit for the highest prize at parish fairs,
Set in the window, bringing memories
         Of fruit-trees laden by low-singing rills,
And dewy dawns, and mystical blue skies
         In benediction over nun-like hills.
My eyes grew dim, and I could no more gaze;
         A wave of longing through my body swept,
And, hungry for the old, familiar ways,
         I turned aside and bowed my head and wept."
"Alfonso, Dressing to Wait at Table","Alfonso is a handsome bronze-hued lad
         Of subtly-changing and surprising parts;
His moods are storms that frighten and make glad,
         His eyes were made to capture women’s hearts.
Down in the glory-hole Alfonso sings
         An olden song of wine and clinking glasses
And riotous rakes; magnificently flings
         Gay kisses to imaginary lasses.
Alfonso’s voice of mellow music thrills
         Our swaying forms and steals our hearts with joy;
And when he soars, his fine falsetto trills
         Are rarest notes of gold without alloy.
But, O Alfonso! wherefore do you sing
         Dream-songs of carefree men and ancient places?
Soon we shall be beset by clamouring
         Of hungry and importunate palefaces."

Mexican Market Woman,"This ancient hag
Who sits upon the ground
Selling her scanty wares
Day in, day round,
Has known high wind-swept mountains,
And the sun has made
Her skin so brown."
America,"Although she feeds me bread of bitterness,
And sinks into my throat her tiger’s tooth,
Stealing my breath of life, I will confess
I love this cultured hell that tests my youth!
Her vigor flows like tides into my blood,
Giving me strength erect against her hate.
Her bigness sweeps my being like a flood.
Yet as a rebel fronts a king in state,
I stand within her walls with not a shred
Of terror, malice, not a word of jeer.
Darkly I gaze into the days ahead,
And see her might and granite wonders there,
Beneath the touch of Time’s unerring hand,
Like priceless treasures sinking in the sand."
Question [1],"When the old junk man Death
Comes to gather up our bodies
And toss them into the sack of oblivion,
I wonder if he will find
The corpse of a white multi-millionaire
Worth more pennies of eternity,
Than the black torso of
A Negro cotton-picker?"
Negro,"I am a Negro:
        Black as the night is black,
        Black like the depths of my Africa.
I’ve been a slave:
        Caesar told me to keep his door-steps clean.
        I brushed the boots of Washington.
I’ve been a worker:
        Under my hand the pyramids arose.
        I made mortar for the Woolworth Building.
I’ve been a singer:
        All the way from Africa to Georgia
        I carried my sorrow songs.
        I made ragtime.
I’ve been a victim:
        The Belgians cut off my hands in the Congo.
        They lynch me still in Mississippi.
I am a Negro:
        Black as the night is black,
        Black like the depths of my Africa."
To One Coming North,"At first you’ll joy to see the playful snow,
         Like white moths trembling on the tropic air,
Or waters of the hills that softly flow
         Gracefully falling down a shining stair.
And when the fields and streets are covered white
         And the wind-worried void is chilly, raw,
Or underneath a spell of heat and light
         The cheerless frozen spots begin to thaw,
Like me you’ll long for home, where birds’ glad song
         Means flowering lanes and leas and spaces dry,
And tender thoughts and feelings fine and strong,
         Beneath a vivid silver-flecked blue sky.
But oh! more than the changeless southern isles,
         When Spring has shed upon the earth her charm,
You'll love the Northland wreathed in golden smiles
         By the miraculous sun turned glad and warm."
Aunt Sue’s Stories,"Aunt Sue has a head full of stories.
Aunt Sue has a whole heart full of stories.
Summer nights on the front porch
Aunt Sue cuddles a brown-faced child to her bosom
And tells him stories.
Black slaves
Working in the hot sun,
And black slaves
Walking in the dewy night,
And black slaves
Singing sorrow songs on the banks of a mighty river
Mingle themselves softly
In the flow of old Aunt Sue’s voice,
Mingle themselves softly
In the dark shadows that cross and recross
Aunt Sue’s stories.
And the dark-faced child, listening,
Knows that Aunt Sue’s stories are real stories.
He knows that Aunt Sue never got her stories
Out of any book at all,
But that they came
Right out of her own life.
The dark-faced child is quiet
Of a summer night
Listening to Aunt Sue’s stories."
The Call to Duty,"The morning breaks upon the shore, 
    The day from slumber doth awake, 
     Bestir, ye ships of life, and shake
The drowsy anchor for the oar.
Let Indolence with night retire,
    Spread out Industry’s swelling sail,
    Let Commerce catch the morning gale,
And cheer her hearth and trim her fire.
Let Journalism ope the strife,
    And wield her unembarrassed pen,
    And paint the daring deeds of men, 
With all the tints and taints of life.
Let Science with her aspect bold
    Resume her firm, unflinching march,
    In undiscovered fields to search,
The hidden treasures to unfold.
Philosophy of mind profound,
    With doubting step now take the field,
    And strive to break the mystic shield,
The deeper depths of truth to sound.
Let Art uprear her stately head,
  Employ her brush and dye at ease,
  And fling her colors to the breeze,
And round her shaded influence shed.
Let Agriculture’s lowly train,
  With willing heart and nimble hand,
  Sweep onward like a learned band,
And spread profusion o’er the plain.
Let Justice spread her gilded wing
  O’er each oppressed race of man,
  Bid slavery lose her deadly ban,
While all the bells of freedom ring.
Let Knowledge with her myriad plumes
    Bespangle all her prosperous land,
    Let Love and Truth go hand in hand, 
And lay the tracks with sweet perfumes.
Let pompous Pride with tuneful ear,
    And wanton Wealth with piercing eye, 
    Search o’er the vale of Poverty,
Where dwell the creatures of Despair.
Let Charity with liberal hand
    Spread far and wide her ample store,
    Possess the rich, anoint the poor,
And heal the sufferings of the land.
Let sweet Religion lift her voice,
  And bid melodious anthems swell, 
   Jehovah’s praises forth to tell, 
Till all the world His name rejoice.
Let Music with bewitching sound
    Her full-grown symphonies employ,
    Proclaim the genial burst of joy,
And charm the toiling host around.
Let Poesy from sleep awake,
    And touch her strings and rouse her lyre,
    And roll celestial balls of fire,
Till all shall act for Duty's sake.
Let dove-eyed Peace with balmy breath
    Exhale and waft her influence far, 
    And lull the brazen notes of war,
And soothe the bitter pangs of death.
Let each act well his chosen art, 
    In perfect concord with the whole,
    Let streams of progress onward roll, 
Back to the Source that gave them start."
Midsummer,"This starbreak is celestial air, 
Just silver; earthlight, dying amber.
Underneath an arch of pallor
Summer keeps her brightened chamber.

Bright beauty of the risen dust
And deep flood-mark of beauty pressed
Up from earth in lovely flower,
High against my lonely breast;

Thou rhythm like the changing moon’s
The catch to which the waters play,
That as they kiss moon-silver sink,—
As soon to spurn the baffled clay;

Only before the waters fall
Is Paradise shore for gaining now.
The grasses drink the berry-bright dew;
The small fruits jewel all the bough.

Heart-breaking summer beyond taste,
Ripeness and frost are soon to know;
But might such color hold the west,
And time, and time, be honey-slow! "
Professional Spanish Knocks on the Door,"At first we don’t answer. 
Knocks that loud usually mean 5-0 is on the other end.

The person on the other side of the door
is speaking professional Spanish.
Professional Spanish is fake friendly.
Is a warning.
Is a downpour when you
Just spent your last twenty dollars on a wash and set.
Is the kind of Spanish that comes
to take things away from you.
The kind of Spanish that looks at your Spanish like it needs help.
Professional Spanish of course doesn’t offer help.
It just wants you to know that it knows you need some.
Professional Spanish is stuck up
like most people from the hood who get good jobs.
Professional Spanish is all like I did it you can do it too.
Professional Spanish thinks it gets treated better than us
because it knows how to follow the rules.
Because it says Abrigo instead of Có.
Because it knows which fork belongs to the salad
and which spoon goes in the coffee.
Because it gets to be the anchor on Telemundo and Univision
and we get to be the news that plays behind its head in the background."
A Love Note,"for Willem
My love,
you are water upon water
upon water until it turns
azure, mountainous.
The horizon fills like sand
between glass marbles. So much
has passed between us—
last night you told me
to press your hand
harder and harder as I pained.
The sunset was at its last
embers. The dark was stealing
the blue light from our room.
I was falling into you.
~ ~
Compress water and it turns to ice— compress beauty
and it loses breath. Gaze at it too long, and even the wide
mirror of the ocean will shatter.
~ ~
My Willem,
between us, God has descended in all His atoms.
We have not yet learned to hold Him."
The Year Before I Left For Mars,"That night the moon’s song was
Cupped by the edge of the plane’s hum.
The beginning soundtrack for our last meeting.
Throughout it all, your breathing slighted the mourning.
We lay, as the loose sand soon hooked
Into the concave of our backs. The ocean waves
Undulating, marking between us, my fast breath.
There is another line here, but I’m not sure
Where to locate it. I could have
Looked at the moon, asked for forgiveness,
But like you, I searched for meteors instead.
You taught me what they look like,
By verbal description, by whispers, and pointing but
Characteristically, I kept missing them.
Because I’m not so good with language,
Nor instructions, and saying goodbye
Where the ground, sea, and sky meet and depart.
Listen: I’m clumsy with my hands and feet.
I also don’t know how to clean a microwave.
And I’m not sure what to say to you anymore.
But that night, before I left, I learned on my own,
Without telling you: This is how you find meteors.
You have to take in the entire dark sky, (like viewing a landscape painting or
A movie screen), but let the frame blanket over our bodies until nothing is left.
Watch carefully, because meteors
Disappear in a glimpse, into the slender cock of your neck,
In my short eyelash flutter.
One by one, then another.
By the end, we are greedy.
We stop counting
As we clasp our hands,
Gulp in the disappearing us, then
Suffocated, strayed."

Stand in rage as wind and current clash

fire surge and boulder crash
         Let the ocean eat and scrape away these walls
Let the sand swallow their fences whole
                       Let the air between us split the atmosphere
We have no land             No country
             But we have these bodies              these stories
this language of rage                    left 
                 This resistance is bitter
and tastes like medicine                 Our lands 
               replanted in the dark and warm             there

    Delicate flowers of sin,
Lilies, arrayed in glory,

Here lies a man whose ships were wrecked

His little credence strained at gnats—

I took of life all it could give:

The Easter Flower,"Far from this foreign Easter damp and chilly
         My soul steals to a pear-shaped plot of ground,
Where gleamed the lilac-tinted Easter lily
         Soft-scented in the air for yards around;
Alone, without a hint of guardian leaf!
         Just like a fragile bell of silver rime,
It burst the tomb for freedom sweet and brief
         In the young pregnant year at Eastertime;
And many thought it was a sacred sign,
         And some called it the resurrection flower;
And I, a pagan, worshiped at its shrine,
         Yielding my heart unto its perfumed power."
"Beat, Old Heart","Beat, old heart, these are the old bars
All stragglers have beat against.
Beat on these bars like the old sea
Beats on the rocks and beaches.
Beat here like the old winter winds
Beat on the prairies and timbers.
Old grizzlies, eagles, buffalo,
Their paws and beaks register this.
Their hides and heads say it with scars."
Fins,"Plow over bars of sea plowing,
the moon by moon work of the sea,
the plowing, sand and rock, must
be done.
Ride over, ride over bars of sea riding,
the sun and the blue riding of the sea—
sit in the saddles and say it, sea riders.
Slant up and go, silver breakers; mix
the high howls of your dancing; shoot
your laugh of rainbow foam tops.
Foam wings, fly; pick the comers, the fin pink,
the belly green, the blue rain sparks, the
white wave spit—fly, you foam wings.
The men of the sea are gone to work; the women
of the sea are off buying new hats, combs, clocks;
it is rust and gold on the roofs of the sea."
Four Steichen Prints,"The earth, the rock and the oil of the earth, the
slippery frozen places of the earth, these are for homes

curves of the arcs of the rainbow prisms—between sun
and rock they lift to the sun their foam feather and go.
. .
Throw your neck back, throw it back till the neck
muscles shine at the sun, till the falling hair at the
scalp is a black cry, till limbs and knee bones form
an altar, and a girl's torso over the fire-rock torso shouts
hi yi, hi yee, hallelujah.
. .
Goat girl caught in the brambles, deerfoot or fox-head,
ankles and hair of feeders of the wind, let all the covering
burn, let all stopping a naked plunger from plunging
naked, let it all burn in this wind fire, let the fire have
it in a fast crunch and a flash.
. .
They threw you into a pot of thorns with a wreath in
your hair and bunches of grapes over your head—your
hard little buttocks in the thorn—then the black eyes,
the white teeth, the nameless muscular flair of you,
rippled and twisted in sliding rising scales of laughter;
the earth never had a gladder friend; pigs, goats, deer,
tawny tough-haired jaguars might understand you."
Wind Rising in the Alleys,"Wind rising in the alleys
My spirit lifts in you like a banner
  Streaming free of hot walls.
You are full of unspent dreams . . .
You are laden with beginnings . . .
There is hope in you . . . not sweet . . .
    acrid as blood in the mouth.
Come into my tossing dust
Scattering the peace of old deaths,
Wind rising in the alleys
Carrying stuff of flame."
In Summer Twilight,"Just a dash of lambent carmine
  Shading into sky of gold;
Just a twitter of a song-bird
  Ere the wings its head enfold;
Just a rustling sigh of parting
  From the moon-kissed hill to breeze;
And a cheerful gentle, nodding
  Adieu waving from the trees;
Just a friendly sunbeam’s flutter
  Wishing all a night’s repose,
Ere the stars swing back the curtain
  Bringing twilight’s dewy close."
Rememory,"           is the sound of me thinking
in a language stolen from my
ancestors. I can’t tell you who the
first slave in my family was, but we
are the last. Descendants
of the sun. Rye skinned
and vibrant, wailing to
a sailing tomb. We twist
creoled tongues. Make English
a song worth singing. You erase
our history and call it freedom.
Take our flesh and call it fashion.
Swallow nations and call it
humanity. We so savage
we let you live. 
           I can’t tell you who the first slave
in my family was, but we remember
the bodies.   Our bodies remember.
We are their favorite melody. Beat
into bucket. Broken
into cardboard covered
concrete. Shaken
into Harlem. The getting over
never begins, but there
is always the get down. Our DNA
sheet music humming
at the bottom
of the ocean."
Once upon a Black Imagination ...,"The space of Blackness represents safety because this is where everyone can finally belong. The clumsy fantasy of Whiteness has finally been moved off the stage and back into the audience after being muted for taking up too much space.
People who previously believed they weren’t Black because they never believed Black to be synonymous with “human’’ unlearn their antiblackness, upend the clumsy possum of their proxy privilege, back away from the hot trash of color-blind rhetoric and stop talking about the impossibility of walking a mile in the shoes of others. No one apologizes for being Black because Being Black is more of a “you’re welcome” situation.
We are finally allowed to make mistakes and express our emotions and be as mediocre as we can allow ourselves to be. After 8 generations, we have forgotten the ways we now call “dominant” and make space for loving ourselves for no reason."
window on my part-time employer in the one building that was once two,"i’m writing to the building of writing that is continually giving us the boot. writing alone can’t hold it up. i want to say writing created it, but it might have just assisted. and yet writing is its own building. writing extends the building. i’m from a long line of building extenders, a line that was broken. that line can be broken. it can be outlawed and driven out of town, the word finding refuge in the mountain, the mouth, the memory. it can be fired and replaced, a thread erased. it can’t all be put down. it rises up an ancestor told me. a few ancestors told me that. i will be an ancestor telling you to rise up. but as a present-day person I tend to lay there. i’ve been thrust from the building of letters, syllables, characters. they’re scattered and i lack the will to gather them. it is fine to lay among them. let them scramble. eventually i will get up and put them together again. it won’t be like i imagined. it will be.
immediate post-script
 
for a minute there, my keyboard stopped working. i was talking about letters and they wouldn’t come. i did not lay calmly. it was not a calm, it was a panic. i am wrong to say i could be so calm. i would fight for a while. i would fight to get back to the letter, to get back to the building, fight to make a new one.

And like any creature that has its hood up, you

preface to a traffic stop: sound,"i always thought sound was meant to indicate a kinda genuine, authentic, absolute individuation, which struck me as A: undesirable—& B: damn near impossible. whereas sound was reality in the midst of this intense engagement with all the sound you ever heard. sound shaped within a climate inciting performance as black matter .or. anti matter, as in against. sound a central body of “sonic” whereas you struggle to make a difference, so to speak, within that sound—& that difference isn’t necessarily about you as an individual but more simply trying to augment & differentiate the sound around you getting closer & closer to a never-ending where you are the proletariat in somebody else’s melodrama as both spectacle and spectator—as the drama unfolds—hold—hold on."

They go down shot, hanged, sick, broken.

Call hallelujah, call amen, call deep thanks.

Black horizons, kiss me.
That is all; so many lies; killing so cheap;
babies so cheap; blood, people, so cheap; and
land high, land dear; a speck of the earth
costs; a suck at the tit of Mother Dirt so
clean and strong, it costs; fences, papers,
sheriffs; fences, laws, guns; and so many
stars and so few hours to dream; such a big
song and so little a footing to stand and
sing; take a look; wars to come; red rivers
to cross.
Black horizons, come up.
Black horizons, kiss me."
Sea Slant,"On up the sea slant,
On up the horizon,
This ship limps.
The bone of her nose fog-gray,
The heart of her sea-strong,
She came a long way,
She goes a long way.
On up the horizon,
On up the sea-slant,
She limps sea-strong, fog-gray.
She is a green-lit night gray.
She comes and goes in sea fog.
Up the horizon slant she limps."
July,"Sunshine and shadow play amid the trees
In bosky groves, while from the vivid sky
The sun’s gold arrows fleck the fields at noon,
      Where weary cattle to their slumber hie.
How sweet the music of the purling rill,
Trickling adown the grassy hill!
While dreamy fancies come to give repose
When the first star of evening glows."
The Cottonwood People,"Faint. Uncombed. Awash in rain.
They share the kind of beauty shared by older women.
Rhapsody in wind. Buds,
not leaves: the small greens crowding up behind them.
Music, if one could see it, its wicker, its cursive strain.
Spruce, which has the heavier sails, flapping.
You are everything you feel beside the river.
Through the silver-paned bark, the diamond pores of
sloughed off skin. If I saw my soul, she would be this tree,
and I would love her.
Placing stops between the strings, a composer
warps the score though making noise is never the intention.
One can draw anything on paper and ask a musician to play it.
For instance, a violinist known for her sheer nerves.

Good Night,"Many ways to spell good night.
Fireworks at a pier on the Fourth of July
        spell it with red wheels and yellow spokes.
They fizz in the air, touch the water and quit.
Rockets make a trajectory of gold-and-blue
        and then go out.
Railroad trains at night spell with a smokestack
        mushrooming a white pillar.
Steamboats turn a curve in the Mississippi crying
        in a baritone that crosses lowland cottonfields
        to a razorback hill.
It is easy to spell good night.
                                     Many ways to spell good night."
remedies I,"what can I know of this life but what it cost me? pretending to
love these patterns of negotiation, pretending the Doubleworld
was acceptable—the Skin beneath the Skin made Hell of our Hell,
the Source from which the Source draws rectifies its embellishment,
reifies its abandon. Another way: in a room filled w/ overturned
bottles, the ceiling fan turns, knowing not the relief it provides,
but damns w/ its clicking; we lie awake at night wondering would
it be better to sweat out our sheets, turn the thing off. we remember
stillness as we enact it, hoping to quiet our body as to cool it.

I recall how slowly Granny eat, I see her in her dining room chair."
"What he thought belly down, when I was 8 years old","What he thought belly down, face down on the beige speckled tile floor, new wax, drill holes where desks had been anchored. Of the shield-thick hovering air. He could be a ribbon of wax, a thin trail of caulk. Something left over above his breath and heart sounds he could hear waiting like a hymn and pipe organs’ stop just before release.
What he thought belly down, face down on the ice sliding between cars toward the gutter. Of the rifle smug and steady at his forehead and jittery sawed-off rushing his wife for her wedding rings. Of the streetlight shadow. The hydrant hunched in the snow-crusted grass. The salted walk. His little girl mid-step on the porch and the wrought iron storm door and front door ajar.
When I was 8 years old I thought my father was a monster.
When I was 8 years old I thought my father could fly.
When I was 8 years old I thought my father was a dark room
In a dark house with walls of eyes and teeth and banisters of thick rough skin.
The rooms around him were also monsters and they were tall
As telephone poles with flesh of kerosene and black fire.
Their arms were always open and they surrounded my father,
Keeping him warm for as long as he chose to stand on the earth
Watching me."
Born. Living. Will. Die.,"for my favorite auntie, Jeanette
Sometimes I think I’m never going to write a poem again
and then there’s a full moon.
I miss being in love but I miss
myself most when I’m gone.
In the salty wet air of my ancestry
my auntie peels a mango with her teeth
and I’m no longer
writing political poems; because there are
mangoes and my favorite memory is still alive.
I’m digging for meaning but haunted by purpose
and it’s an insufficient approach.
What’s the margin of loss on words not spent today?

Everything Needs Fixing,"in your thirties everything needs fixing. i bought a toolbox
for this. filled it with equipment my father once owned
to keep our home from crumbling. i purchased tools with
names & functions unknown to me. how they sat there
on their shelf in plastic packaging with price tags screaming:
hey lady, you need this!  like one day i could give my home
& everything living inside it the gift of immortality, to be
a historical monument the neighbors would line up
to visit even after i’m gone & shout: damn that’s a nice house!
i own a drill now, with hundreds & hundreds of metal pieces
i probably won’t use or use in the wrong ways but what
i’m certain of, is still, the uncertainty of which tools repair
the aging dog, the wilting snake plant, the crow’s feet
under my eyes, the stiff knee or bad back.
& maybe this is how it is—how parts of our small universe
dissolve like sugar cubes in water—a calling to ask us
to slow our busy breathing so we can marvel
at its magic. because even the best box of nails are capable
of rust. because when i was a child i dropped
a cookie jar in the shape of noah’s ark,
a family heirloom that shattered to pieces.
the animals broke free, zebras ran under
the kitchen table, the fractured lion roared by
the front door & out of the tool cabinet
i snagged duck tape & ceramic glue. pieced each beast
back to their intended journey.  because that afternoon
when my father returned from work i confessed
& he sat the jar on the counter only to fill it with
pastries. how the cracks of imperfection mended by
my hands laid jagged. chipped paint sliced across a rhino’s neck.

Summit And Vale,"The light hangs over the mountain top,

On the mountains far, while the rain’s below."

Oh, clasp me close, with your lips on mine,
        And it’s hey for love, for I love you so!
The sea lies violet, deep, and wide,
My heart beats high with the rushing tide;
Was it fancy, beloved, the seagulls cried:
        “Sing loud for love, for I love him so”?
Oh, little boat for tossing wave,
        Sing loud for love, for I love him so!
Oh, y’all pine tree in the shadows grave,
        Sing loud for love, for I love him so!
The little waves kiss the gleaming sand,
I laugh in the sun on the joyful land;
Beloved, one clasp of your strong young hand;
        The world is fair, for I love you so!"
A Common Plaint,"If I could write a tale to-night,
A tale of thrilling things;
A spice of love, a bit of fight,
The clink of wedding rings,
The villain’s death, and all end right,
If I could write a tale to-night.
My pot is on the fire to-night,
Alas, it needs to boil;
I gaze with would-be seeress sight,
And burn the midnight oil,
Alack, again, I cannot write,
My pot is on the fire to-night.
A check looms large into my sight,
And here, I scribble rhymes;
No editor will heed my plight,
I’ve proved that scores of times:
Oh, hero, gallant, come bedight,
A check looms large into my sight.
I gaze into the fire to-night,
And build my castles there;
Great mansions, tall, and all alight,
Alas, they turn to air.
Then vainly, I for ideas fight,
And gaze into the fire to-night.
It is no use, I cannot write,
I’d rather dream than work;
Then what’s the use, let’s take to-night
For luxury of shirk.
Those editors would send it back,
I cannot write, ah, well, alack!"
Rainy Day,"What though the rain be falling chill and gray,
A ceaseless dripping from the sad, brown caves?
A tiny bird is singing cross the way.
        Beneath the friendly shelter of the leaves.
The mountain top is sheathed in vapors white,
And o’er the valley hands a chilly path.
But through the mists are riding into night.
The robin sounds his loving, little call.
I hear the foaming torrent in its rush.
        And o’er the rocks “It rests in full-grown pride”;
Through gray and green of earth, there is one flush.
        A tiger-lily on the grim rock’s side,
Life may be drear, and hope seem far away.
But ever through the mist some bird will sing;
And through the dullest, rainy world of gray,
Some bright-hued flower, its flash of promising bring."

Searching for a Palestinian Necropastoral (Eve),"& I found it at the bottom of an american river—& in
the leaves which gathered at its surface’s semblance
of stillness, appearing & not so, as if endless
though counted for, & I found it not in the beams
of light, but how, electric & frantic, they danced beneath 
the water, like a choreography preceding any notion of
body, or unknowable twins returning to the half-self 
they could have never imagined & I found it in that half
-liminal light, divined into fractal’s endless—before split 
& risen, before splay & tempt, before 
womblessness became an american sadness & I found it
in my mother’s breath, her reek of rivers still
enough to pass as reflection & in the smogged 
aftermath of filter & filter &, I found it—there,
yes, there: in the wilderness rotting 
at the center of me—crater of me, tender cesspool 
unaccounted for, unnameable aside from the complacency 
of latex & in the tempt of men I will 
not fable, not legend, or border between. Because I cannot
taint this dark with all the names
they could not give me, the only crown I reach for 
is felled kingdom—this is how I fawn 
the toxic, flora. But is this not the first 
motion, of arriving at a pastoral: to have 
a past to run from? Though the Anthropocene of me
is memoryless as a pathing wind, as prayer’s
barter. Gethsemane of me, I beg of you a fruit
half-bitten & worm writhed—first language, bitter 
prosody of me. This is the only fall my body 
can muster: eclipse of. Lone, knowable 
nightfall. I cannot return to a weightless less american 
than this, the pulled into: body 
                                                    of me. Poisoning eucharist 
of. Take me into the canon’s night & may it be a good, 
good night—& may that night be anything, anything but

With the Lark,"Night is for sorrow and dawn is for joy,
Chasing the troubles that fret and annoy;
Darkness for sighing and daylight for song,—
Cheery and chaste the strain, heartfelt and strong.
All the night through, though I moan in the dark,
I wake in the morning to sing with the lark.

Deep in the midnight the rain whips the leaves,
Softly and sadly the wood-spirit grieves.
But when the first hue of dawn tints the sky,
I shall shake out my wings like the birds and be dry;
And though, like the rain-drops, I grieved through the dark,
I shall wake in the morning to sing with the lark.
On the high hills of heaven, some morning to be,
Where the rain shall not grieve thro’ the leaves of the tree,
There my heart will be glad for the pain I have known,
For my hand will be clasped in the hand of mine own;
And though life has been hard and death’s pathway been dark,
I shall wake in the morning to sing with the lark."
After the Music,"Praise the Zoom call.
You’re on mute, love!
Can’t hear you —
(secretly) Praise (the bad) connection.
Praise our home offices, our home schools,
our home gyms, our closed bars, our kitchen dances,
our cooking fails, our odd jobs. Our rented
U-Hauls. Our promises to stay.
In a workshop (online, duh), my friend Dorsay,
a resplendent seventy five, crowned in Diana Ross curls,
shares her poem: butterflies, a lover’s caress
and then — Why should I not want to just die?
She seeded concerts across the city for decades.
Now, it’s impossible to sing together. Everyone is slightly
out of time. What happens after the music?
We gape and stammer, but Dorsay —
she booms laughter, claps her hands.
We’re here aren’t we? However we gather,
it’s a party. Our face parade, through lag and crash, and latency,
logging on against erasure. I’ll be there
next week, writes Dorsay. A late night promise.
The next morning, bougainvillea shocks pink
across the sidewalk. I leave the Russian bakery
with a loaf of black Borodinsky rye.
Praise the long walk, with no end. The right now.
Our newly fragiled bodies.
That awkward, grateful way we hold each other
at any distance."
The Comfort Ghosts,"They are all here,
generations of elder queers with crooked hands
like trees. I shake my whole self at the giant’s trunk.
The forest glistens. A world built on invisible
shimmers suddenly in the light.
If only the roots could see the budding sky.
If only I could garden my history so deep.
This is strength.
This is pride.
To be burned, emptied.
To stand tall, anyway, play host to new branches, fresh green,
a forest with a single
root system.
Whatever they say of us, let them say,
we didn’t do this alone."
Heirloom,"Dad always grew tomatoes
They were his pride and joy
So when the lady outside Home Depot
Offered me the box and said,
‘Do you have a garden?’
I didn’t say no, though I should have
I said, ‘We have a theatre…’
And somehow that was just as good.
It grows like a weed in Hollywood
In the cracks between Film and Industry
It was a grease monkey’s garage, then a shooting range
But only now
Can we call the people who run it clowns.
We put the tomatoes out
On the air conditioning supply unit
To try to add some poetry to that phrase.
Today is tomatoes in the parking lot
Tomorrow is white roof, filtered water, solar
panels, cycle racks, urban garden, green
building, public plaza, artist’s village
To build a cultural heritage for the city
I once heard described as ‘Hell’s parking lot’
Tomato by tomato
Because nobody dreams as hard as poets
And nobody works as hard as clowns."
Ocean Water,"The ocean pushes back
Alive and vigorous
The heritage of habitat
Leans against expectation
Muscles its due respect
Without regard
Without warning
Without reorienting the ones
With swimming pool perspectives
Limitations of consistent temperatures
and painted cement walls
The ocean rumbles its sovereignty
Full weight of freedom on my
skin"
All the Lives We Are,"The dairy farmer replied, “Stop
Calling things that aren’t milk
Milk. The newspaper series
was compelling, even
to a city chick like me
I add oat milk to the grocery list
I think of the dairy farmer
The journalist earned awards
Delivery person trades texts, exchanging
broccoli sprouts for bunches or
Did I order that by mistake?
I tipped him fifteen percent, sometimes
I tip twenty. Every time is a goal
To not hesitate or have to calculate,
Project out for 30 days
The same way he, surely, will
I wonder if he does his own shopping
In between or other days
I thank him, wave through the screen
A woman sits in his passenger seat
Winter coat open, attention on her phone
I wonder if she rides often, all the time
After a fight
Could be his best friend, like my daughter’s best guy
friends from high school, their small colony of peers
Crossing over the gritty sands into maturity
The cicadas are coming this year
Billions, according to the news
I am intent to obsess over both groups of new adults
I shuttle the groceries from porch to kitchen"
The Library,"Bend pages at the corner
Folding into the stories
We tell about ourselves
About each other
About days dissolved
and seasons yet to come
Circulate riches to every spirit and spine
Stack rhyme schemes and prophecy
Humanity and hypotheses
Guard our stories, stretching from soil to sky
Common and crown, ground level to grand heights
And all of our mass in the middle
Mass, in the middle
The accumulated weight of all our question marks
Our catalog of anxious cells and eager breaths
Warm the hallways, the portals and platforms
Ignite hope along dim landscapes
Archive the shine of our collective living.
Our electric resistance to darkness"
INTO THE THICKET,"We go looking for tea cedar, crow feather, and first snow
to stick, but find the mud still warm under our feet, the Earth's
moist breath still fogging the looking glass this late into fall.
Deep in our bones, we know we'll waltz on over the Frost Moon
before the first big freeze cracks Ironwood, and the hunkered
Sun, low in her cross-quarter nest, fades into dim Solstice.
The Wind Hag is just now beginning her November dance,
pirouetting north, Superior throbbing her meter
deep into the basalt below and beyond simple ken.
Deep in our bones, we feel the forest vibrate in omen,
but as we’ve no one near to confide in, we must worry
our best wishes, casting spells against the coming darkness."

euthanized on cool metal, scraps

WAVE AFTER WAVE,"Dawn, a lit fuse. The radioman says
“bombogenesis,” like agates tumbling
from a jar—system as meteorite
off Whitefish Point. In other words, water
lynx, Mishipeshu, lathered up in red.
In a heartbeat, rollers mass two stories
trough to insatiate tempest, unquelled
by prayer nor cigarette, careless, mean,
a cold-blooded indifference so pure,
a strong swimmer won't last ten wet minutes.
At the Keweenaw, surf pummels the stamp
sands with ochre fists, ore boats stack up lee
of the stone, and entire beaches stand up
to walk away. At Marquette, two lovers
walk onto Black Rocks, sacrificial lambs—
their bodies will never be recovered."
"LAND ACKNOWLEDGEMENT, 1842 TERRITORY","Deep time and song, these infinite nations
under cathedral woodland dome, boundless,
long as memory, tall as a story
spun summer from spring, winter from autumn,
sugar bush from trout stream from wolf hymn, moon
to the sun, salt to sweet sea, all fire,
all the branches swaying, leaf and needle,
soul seed dirt to green to gold, queued to choir.
Then snake, the booze hag jig, the winking eye.
Mowed down to cord and plow, built mine and rail,
burnt bar and blade—give an inch, give a mile,
give a swollen river of blood. Gut shot,
       call it by name. Gone to ground and held on
       mother tongue, lost, but come again in word:
Maananoons. “No such thing as a trash tree.”
Just white washed hands. Patience is a weapon
is a sign is a wheel is medicine.
But poison, too—relearn the tell. Wiigwaas.
Giizhik. Biisaandago-zhingwaak. Can’t duck
and dodge the unlearned thing, can’t eat a poem,
can’t dance atop a land acknowledgement.
A gravestone by any other name is.
Less than a prayer. Still, we could turn east
to an island thick bearded, burl and boll.
Our choices could kindle to gossamer
green, quick between crow’s return and chorus
      frog. Together, zagaakwaa ezhaayin—
      the forest is dense where you are going."
In Flight,"A big, hefty guy next to me, an even bigger guy
already squeezed into the window seat. Big, pleasant
fellows. Strangers before this three-hour non-stop
domestic flight. But they’ve been talking away non-stop
since before take-off. Talking business. Talking sports.
China. India (my next-seat neighbor might have been
from India). Talking Cubs and Red Sox (they both love
them both). Google. The Euro. Leverage. Banks. Bailouts.
Masters of Money (“It will change the way you think”).
Great deals and missed opportunities. Exxon. Fracking.
Megabus. Amtrak. Breakdowns. Lost luggage and
missed connections. A good place to stay in Detroit.
Neither Cheez-Its nor Diet Cokes inhibit the juggernaut.
So much experience, so many theories, so much
friendly advice. The urgent need to tell each other
everything they know before the flight is over—
the Indian fellow occasionally bumping my left arm
in his enthusiasm. “Exactly!” “Absolutely!”
All they’ve learned and thought, pouring out.
Pouring out, yet steering clear of delicate subjects: politics
(they know better than that), or home (an hour into the flight,
“my wife” has become “ex-wife”). No names.
Nothing about movies or television. No mention of
any other book. No music. But thoroughly tuned in
to each other (“Exactly!” “Absolutely!”),
handing over and taking in
whatever they can in 195 minutes—
like old friends.
Except not.
As we begin our rough descent, a startling
silence fills the cabin. One of them has drifted
into sleep. Stretching to look out the window
I can make out farmland, roads, then tractors,
and cars. Some bumps, and the sleeper awakes.
But the conversation is over. Shutting down.
Touching down. Each of us left with our own thoughts
of arrival or another departure. Then the busy powering up
of phones, the clumsy lowering of overhead bags.
Jamming the aisle, eager to get off and on
with our lives. No handshakes. No goodbyes. But
separated in the crowd, and each with a little wave,
they call out. “Sam.” “Andy.”"
Renato's Dream,"Brazil, 1991
Such a sweet dream. I dreamed
I was having a conversation
with the great poets—Manuel
Bandeira and Carlos Drummond
de Andrade. “I was born
tired, hungry, and cold,” I said.
And Drummond answered, “I too.”"

Pieces of a puzzle."
Dyer Died In Silence,"She went from a shutter to silence
Eyes glazed over with the void of stillness.
As if illness suffocated the sight right out of her sockets.
A pocket of air emptied out of her wrinkled throat
One last hallowed gasp before she passed
and the cloak of death covered over her frigid soul.
Sheol opened its’ gluttonous grasp to swallow her whole.
Boney hands reaching around the rope noose
that choked her esophagus and
asphyxiated her malevolent being.
She felt the slow collapse of her lungs.
Life was expunged from her sturdy tyrannical body.
She swayed oddly in the gallows like a broken wind chime.
She wavered awkwardly like a kite string entangled amongst tree twigs.
She died with her heart darkened scorched by wickedness.
Her soul was as pitch, as the bottomless abyss.
Fittingly, Amelia Dyer died, in the same manner in which she had
murderously slain hundreds of innocent infants,
stricken with unfortunate circumstances.
She died unwillingly, yielding only to the restriction of air.
She died suspended in midair.
Even in her death, no one is truly aware of how many children she
carelessly killed for profit and gain.
Only the Thames River will stream confessions of her infamous name.
Its’ waters quivering from the deserted bodies she buried there,
Countless babies forever enslaved in this liquid grave.
Many going unclaimed and some were never recovered.
Their grief stricken mothers went howling, like La Llorona, to the grave
tortured with uncertainty. Amelia took no pity.
Legions of greedy spawns feasted through her intentions.
Amelia killed as many as six children in one day.
Her stern thin lipped scowl will haunt the annals of history.
No darkness can hold a candle to her flame of vile infamy.
Cruelty was personified through her sick twisted mind. She filled 5 books
with her confessions line for line. ‘Baby farming’ and murders were her
crimes. She died on June 10, 1896,
Hanging from the scaffold, she shuttered into silence."
A Reason to be Angry,"I made mosaics
laid my heart’s tiles on display.
Now, you walk on them."
Nigra Sum,"Nigra sum, nigra sum sed Formosa
I am that opal colored onyx stone. Black bone soul
jones in the midnight dreary.
My soul is a weary kind of blues; and you know me
for my ebony hues. Nigra sum.
Like Solomon, the wisest king, with a pigment from
the descent of a chocolate crescent beam. I am the depth of Africa’s dream do
you see me gleam shining a fluid monsoon. Nigra sum.
I am bellowing coal smoky soul. Young and old,
just depending on the century you first got a glimpse of me. The obscured
regions of earth foretold my destiny. I grew from the continent of Mahogany in
full bloom. Nigra sum.
Just mention me to Cairo sands. Echo the song of the
motherland, walking hand in hand with Pharaohs and Abraham. I stand by Cush and
push the seeds of Noah in the land. Water them with the words from my lips. I
am the darkness of every solar eclipse from January ‘til June. Nigra sum.
Do you presume to know my fable? Sit with me at
the Passover table. I was able to break bread with the unleavened. I kissed the
lamb of heaven just before he was betrayed in Gethsemane that day. When the sky
turned pitch from gray, I was the one who sprayed the firmament with my tears.
It was the color of fears and doom. Nigra sum.
Like the daughters of Jerusalem gathering to be
concubines, veiling brown eyes for the wise one, scorched by the sun, double
coated in sable with prose sweeter than molasses and rum maple. I am hune like
their groom. Nigra sum.
Like the inside of tombs, like iron and fumes,
like licorice perfume, like the bottom of a lagoon, I am black, but comely.
Nigra sum.
My skin is baked and burnt melanin versed with the
ink of my pen. I am in the abyss of every woman, waiting to be birthed as life
from her womb. From the den of each uterus I am exhumed, consumed in the
richness of raven shades. Vamp clay made the frame of my being. I am the
blanket overseeing the night as it dances across the expanses of the
hemisphere. It is clear that I too have been touched by the sun so much that I
can absorb the breath of the moon. Nigra sum.
For we must learn to love the skin God put us in
even when the world would condition us to hate it."
"Médée Furieuse, 1838","Furious Medea, Delacroix called her,
but I can see no rage, unless we count
her breasts, twin weapons pointing fiercely
at us, or the hand clenching a dagger,
its shadow slicing her nearest child’s leg.
There is disorder in her hair and robes,
but her face, caught in profile, reveals what we
might read as sadness, a jaw too soft for anger.
The painting’s tension lies in the lack of fury,
in the illusion that she might be guarding
the boys, in our knowledge that she is not.
And the children in her arms—they know it, too.
The one half-hugged, half-throttled squirms away.
The other is folded in a pose so close
to the surrender of nursing he seems at peace
almost, but for his eye, open wide—
and looking directly at us.
                                              How many times
have I seen that look, the flash of fear
on my young daughter’s face when I have raged
at her or some small thing? It passes, the fury
and the terror—my daughter puts on socks;
the driver yields—but I’m left shaken, a stranger.
Maybe all mothers murder their children’s
innocence. In the painting, Medea holds
her boys so close they’re one body again,
two cords she must cut. The children have no choice
but to love the hand that holds the knife."
Shocks and Changes,"Summoned at three, I soothe my daughter’s cries
and, turning back toward bed, turn off her light.
Out of the dark, a galaxy appears,
pale stars scattered across the plaster skies
by some other child who thought this room at night
would be his always. The moons, the meteors—
all his hours spent peeling and arranging—
for two years now have hung above my head
entirely unnoticed. The old wives’ tale
says all the stars whose light we see are dead,
but that’s not true. We fail to see them changing
as they change. And on this closer, human scale
and present tense, this room, this child I’ve kissed,
this night will always and never quite exist."
A Raft of Grief,"“The raft that means ‘a great number’ is not related at all to the raft that carries people or their possessions in the water. The two words are homonyms…” —Morris Dictionary of Word and Phrase Origins
If only there were a boat,
low and long and loaded
with all we’d brought or built:
the fatal inattentions,
anxieties and tics
that time had sanctified,
our good and bad intentions,
rages, lapses, and aches.
If only it were that easy,
to stand only ankle-
deep in the sullied water
hoisting our shared cargo,
sinking no further beneath
its weight. If only the boat
did not need a rower;
we’d push it off together
then wade to opposite banks
absolved at last, forever,
buoyant, watching it go."
Sock Hop,"I was following the little dog through the skinny trees.
I was just collecting water glasses.
I was filling them at the well and carrying them back, one by one,
trying not to drop a single drop.
I was wearing the same shirt as the day before and the day before that
And the day before that.
Asking all my ghosts to join me on the dance floor.
Let’s Twist, let’s shimmy.
While the room waltzes, I will Watusi.
I was Jimmy Switchblade.
I was the Three Cherries Gang.
I was the tallest cigarette in the pack
I was black jacket black collared collar up. I was actually yellow shirt lost.
I was laying in the dirt and piling it on. I believed if I kept trying to bury myself
then maybe I could talk to some other world.
  I just got dirty.
My belly was heavy.
For months, I barely moved.
After she left I barely moved.
I watched the sun go down, and while waiting for it to return I slept
–dreaming of the bicycle but I did not know what the bicycle was.
I thought, What a strange horse that fish is—do I kill it or ride it?
How do I do either of those?
Instead, I baptized myself with bath water, rode the airplanes like they were church.
Hoped the chains could not climb this high.
Staring out the windows, I made a list of my body parts that no longer worked,
folded it into an envelope,
hoping my mother or a former lover would one day come across it.
That list is a poem not a list.
So is this one.
I rode the airplanes
until they brought me 530 miles from the room I was born inside of.
My fists back then were not so much smaller than they are now, simply tighter.
I have been shrinking more and more with every month.
The South it is my beautiful bed.
One day bury me in it.
Till then I will touch it from time to time.
Carry me inside its wet wet heat–
I sweat when I walk.
When I walk I see my dreams come closer.
What I thought was a horse or a fish was really a girl on a bicycle.
She had small fingers but reached them towards me.
I neither killed nor rode her.
All I did was make a hand.
All I did was get wet.
All I did was shake my body like a library in an earthquake.
I spilled books like holy water.
My rooms were a mess.
  The ceiling came in closer to read all that I was–a thousand years of spines,
a pale suit stitched from a riverbank. Bags of the heaviest dust. Splinters
on my tongue from licking the roofs of so many cathedrals–
  I had worked so hard for my sorrow.
So I asked my boss for the night off.
Caught another plane.
Rode it to a dance in Chicago.
  I combed my hair, slicked down with pomade. Put my shiniest belt buckle on.
I saw Suzie on the dance floor.
She put a quarter in the jukebox and grabbed me like a police man
asked What you do Ace?
I told her I work at a malt shop. And sometimes I bury things.
But I ain’t too good at that. I ain’t always too good at that I told her.
She looked at me like we had prayed on the same cliff.
She told me she didn’t believe in God anymore.
I told her I still did.
Her and I, we have prayed on the same cliff.
She held me like a handcuff.
I swallowed keys.
I danced with Suzie all night long.
I’m still waiting for the sun to come up.
I don’t care if it never does.
I am warm enough."
4 stars,"there was a wasp nest on the back porch
it looked like dead honeycomb
outside was a hornet’s hive
I stuck my hand out there
the sun buzzed loudly
nothing could bite me
a caterpillar did
I climbed its tree
it kissed me with its back
its hair was sharp
enough to leave four stars
spinning in my palm
the world spun through my arms
and crashed onto our street
so I picked it up
at the back of the backyard
was a rusty shed falling apart
inside it I swear there was a giant sleeping
I woke him told him my dreams
and led him humming
back into our yellow kitchen
the countertops were always covered in top soil
my mother loved to garden
and to collect marbles inside of mason jars
we were never allowed to touch them
I loved the smell of the air conditioner
there was one in the dining room
and one in my parents’ bedroom
putting my face in front of the vents
made me feel like Sunday
I could bike the whole square of the block in two minutes flat
my friends Jalal, Put, and Rue lived around the corner from us
there was a tree in front of their house
too big to be a birch
my friend Samandar lived two fence hops away
his mother showed mine what God looked like
God He smelled like my father
both their beards were black bears
me and Mom went fishing in the park
I caught two catfish
and waited for them to die
they swam in circles inside of our refrigerator
because I had never learned how to kill anything
in Mississippi we ate every single perch that I caught
the grasshoppers there?
they are the size of an Almond Joy
my sister she had a pet rat
part of his ear was gone
his name was Pierre
I named my mouse after a favorite book
Charlotte’s Web
she is buried under a white rock in the backyard
the day our dog died
Pops found him hanging on the clothesline
I cried into my pillow
I was ten years old
I could fit under the house
my knees didn’t care
neither did the dark
after the tub
the hallway from the bath’s room to mine
was a dark tunnel
breathing only to swallow me whole
I shivered
and was more afraid of that walk
than anything ever since
even now there are moments
where it still shakes me
but there were times when the night
sat beside me on my bed quietly
like it was a big man
who had to do what I told him to do
he was too dumb
or he loved me too much
either way he had the same smile
I ain’t never been stung by a bee before
not my whole life"
Leda,"In the beginning there was only the moonlight
and the rain
and the mud that was left once the rain had stopped
and the footprints left in the mud
made by my boots from when
outside in the rain I had stood
beside the gate through the whole storm
watching out into the nothing that was on the other side of the fence
and once the rain had passed and I had trudged indoors
dredging the mud across my floors and it was
only the moonlight and an inch of rainwater
collecting in my footprints in the yard and also
upon the thin bodies of the night blooming flowers
from out in the distance
the animals began
talking with the world
and I lay in my bed by the open window listening
to that world being born out there
and I watched the swans drop
from the dark air
to fold the lights of the night sky
into the down of their once soaring backs
and that’s when you came home to find me upstairs
asleep
having tried so hard to stay awake but failing
and you woke me with what I know not
the harshest softness
or the most careful of violence
and your face was the first thing that I saw
in the familiar light of this new place"
Letter to my sister,"I have turned our childhood into a few dozen verses;
there are places for dramatic pause,
and where memory failed,
I embellished a bit.
You’ve grown impatient with me
and my so-called poetic license;
I don’t remember that
has become your weary mantra.
D,
I am learning to excavate the good times too.
Can’t you see where I’ve colored some words?
Inserted those tender moments?
A famous writer once said that eventually
I will tire of myself and will be compelled
to tell the I-less stories….I anxiously await that moment.
But for now, I want to tell them about our war with mama’s illness
and how at school we were maimed for being foreign.
Remember D?
When they chased us up Tioga Street
and accused us of having voodoo and
scanned our dark bodies for tribal scars
and discovered the cayenne pepper we had hidden;
to throw in their faces,
to sting them,
to make them fear us,
to be left alone,
to be African.
D,
I have managed to poem all my pain;
tell me,
what do you do with yours?"
An invitation to travel,"In North Philly, we were ambushed by a rogue visitor;
one that clutched our throats and threatened to choke us
out of our budding Americana.
That March, someone reported us to immigration.
And after an investigation,
we were sent a decision.
Arriving in a letter, neat and succinct, was our invitation to travel.
The Mayson family is ordered to depart from the United States of America
at your own expense on or before April 2, 1979.
And we were guilty of the worst crime.
We had no papers.
Dirty immigrants.
Huddled masses.
Illegal aliens.
Pretending to be Americans,
hiding in plain sight among the good people of Philadelphia.
Frenzied lot of Liberians we were,
not even living high off the fat of the land.
We didn’t even sip their milk or their honey.
A shrinking life we had.
So hushed in fact,
that night I strained to hear my father cry—
my mother’s whimpers, barely audible.
And even I learned to tuck this voice
under my tongue
and didn’t release it for years."
But there is still life here,"1.
Someone tagged the shiny new bus stop shelter
just days after the glass got busted out.
Fat nasty letters graffitied on the boarded up frame
commanded, Don’t Gentrify Us!
We spy small movements here and there.
The man who bought the old firehouse and sat
on it for 7 years is making “artist share spaces”
with luxury apartments above. He makes sure the doors
and windows, fences and barriers are hood proof for now.
He doesn’t speak to neighbors while he works.
He and one of his golden hair boys hunch over
this new project, loose limbed and unbothered,
with a palpable air of ownership—like when a dog
runs up on a new spot, sniffs it out, claims it and sprays.
2.
The entire avenue has gone to crap,
said one long time resident as she
shakes her silver rod set in my direction.
That’s how you know it’s changing she says—
when it’s allowed to sit and rot with no interventions,
just endless meetings to distract and defeat.
She tells me that the vultures will swoop in and collect
shells and reimagine relics; then defiantly confides to me,
but they won’t collect these old bones!
I know that’s right, I say back at her as we
pass one empty storefront after another—
display windows barren, riot gates shuttered.
3.
On one of the neighborhood’s social media pages,
the newcomers are a particularly crafty bunch,
holding full court virtual councils on our hood.
It starts with an assertion or accusation of an eyesore;
sometimes a photo branded “bad renovations” is posted;
or someone doesn’t like another’s siding or
choice of windows or painted brick facade.
The overseers have an aesthetic and they’re
ticked that the masses don’t follow.
Remember your 8th grade bullies?
Remember senseless playground rumbles?
Remember getting jacked up after school, just because?
It’s like that except the bullies are all grown now
and they tow their elitism, classism and racism
across Zuckerberg’s virtual stage and puff chests
and huff and heave with each click and post.
4.
The “SELL US YOUR HOME” leaflets invade our mailboxes.
Gaudy loud colored flyers and bandit signs are stapled
on telephone poles. Robocalls and personalized text
messages urge us to Sell, Sell, Sell our piece of property.
Brad or Mike or Jason want to take our burden of a home
off our hands and into his to bulldoze or to pile on two
extra stories of boxy condos; and then suddenly, the streets
will be cleaned and garages will replace basements and faces
too will be replaced. Some have taken the cash and exited,
others hold out, but patient speculators watch the block,
and we watch them; each side driving stakes deep into the concrete.
And then just like that,
the world hurled its magnificent body against us all,
Rammed the pandemic right into our lives and routines and ugliness.
And just for a moment, we were all raw, all scathed, all gutted.
And just for a moment, we raised our white flags and paused.
5.
So now we’re here.
After 365 harrowing days,
after we’ve lost and mourned and isolated;
we are here now. We are here now.
2020 made the mice and pigeons anxious too.
They thieved the breadcrumbs right off those old trails
we once refused to abandon and now we can’t go back.
And now we must resist the urge
to wound, to pierce one another.
Even if we falter or fault or fail
and think all has dissolved,
even if in our blue blue moments
we think we too may disappear
and we hang our heads so low
that it shadows our new paths
even then, we have to point ourselves forward.
6.
There is still life here
and this is where we will pick up from.
A neighbor clears the trash with her lone broom,
her 80 decade old fingers grip the handle
her stooped back bends just at the right angle
to spy me moving toward her to grab her haul—
bottles and cans and plastic bags and bits of stupid
stuff that littering people drop along streets when
they think no one cares. We stand there together,
nearly two generations apart and grin at our progress.
Here on this forgotten block, we are pointing ourselves forward.
7.
There is still life here people.
If we try a little tenderness, we will nurture it.
Even with warning signs of
what’s to come tagged on bus stops,
even with elders clutching their bones on the avenue
and abandoned store fronts pleading
and new construction notices and moving trucks,
and leaflets that offend with promises to devour us,
there is still life.
We are still a beautiful people.
We are still breaking through.
We are still holding steady.
We are still pointing ourselves forward."

Kablooey is the Sound You'll Hear,"then plaster falling and the billow of gypsum
after your sister blows a hole in the ceiling
of your brother’s bedroom with the shotgun
he left loaded and resting on his dresser.
It’s Saturday, and the men are in the fields.
You and your sister are cleaning house
with your mother. Maybe your sister hates
cleaning that much, or maybe she’s just
that thorough, but somehow she has lifted
the gun to dust it or dust under it (you are busy
mopping the stairs) and from the top landing
where you stand, you turn toward the sound
to see your sister cradling the smoking shotgun
in her surprised arms, like a beauty queen
clutching a bouquet of long-stemmed roses
after being pronounced the official winner.
Then the smell of burnt gunpowder
reaches you, dirty orange and sulfurous,
like spent fireworks, and through the veil
of smoke you see a hole smoldering
above her head, a halo of perforations
in the ceiling—the drywall blown clean
through insulation to naked joists, that dark
constellation where the buckshot spread.
The look on your sister’s face is pure
shitfaced shock. You’d like to stop and
photograph it for blackmail or future
family stories but now you must focus
on the face of your mother, frozen at the base
of the stairs where she has rushed from
vacuuming or waxing, her frantic eyes
searching your face for some clue
about the extent of the catastrophe.
But it’s like that heavy quicksand dream
where you can’t move or speak,
so your mother scrambles up the steps
on all fours, rushes past you, to the room
where your sister has just now found her voice,
already screaming her story—it just went off!
it just went off! —as if a shotgun left to rest
on safety would rise and fire itself.
All this will be hashed and re-hashed around
the supper table, but what stays with you
all these years later, what you cannot forget,
is that moment when your mother
waited at the bottom of the steps
for a word from you, one word,
and all you could offer her was silence."
Pre-Existing Conditions,"""I am my sister’s keeper.""
             —Sister Simone Campbell, addressing the Assembly 
             of the Democratic National Convention, Sept. 5, 2012.
Three weeks ago, my sister went on her lunch break
and turned right, for home, rather than left, for the clinic
where she might have been forced to admit to the doctor
that the pain in her left arm was something more than
the chronic ache in her left shoulder from the ladder fall
while cleaning last year. Instead, she went home for soup
which is where my brother found her the next morning
seated at the kitchen counter with her head resting
in her arms, as if she’d only fallen asleep, after her boss
reported that she hadn’t come to work. She rose
each day at 5 A.M to bake muffins and fresh bread
to make the potato salad and rotisserie chickens
that stock the coolers and shelves for the convenience
of others. Too young for Medicare, at 58, she earned
an hourly wage that held her just above the poverty line,
just enough to disqualify her for Medicaid. I see now
how she fell between the cracks. Sure, she tempted fate,
cooked with too many eggs, too much salt, sugar, butter,
and cream. And didn’t we gobble up every rich thing
she put before us? Did she calculate the cost of the new
health care coverage and think, Four hundred dollars
a month. That’s a car payment, that’s forty hours of labor,
a full week of wages. How I wish she’d been forced
to buy it. Did she turn right for home instead of left
for the clinic because she knew a trip to the doctor
would mean a quadruple by-pass, loss of a job,
bankruptcy, and the forced foreclosure of a house
almost paid for. ($700 left on the mortgage at the time
of her death.) So she decided to take the pain
and risk it, believing she was too tough to die.
Well, she wasn’t. To be human is to walk around
with pre-existing conditions—always some muscle
or valve poised to fail, some cell ready to grow wild.
Never before have I wanted to speak to my president
and say, please, hurry up with this. She was my sister,
do you understand? As children, we shared a bathtub,
in those years of once-a-week Saturday night washings.
I can still feel her soapy back against mine. As teenagers,
we shared a bedroom, whispering late into the dark
between our twin beds, until one of us would grow tired
and say, little red school house on the hill, our private code
for “shut up now, so that I can get some sleep.”"
As dogs,"I try a new way of imagining people 
as dogs
as dogs it makes sense 
why anyone would be drawn to do anything 
just as dogs rub themselves 
in patches of grass
or suddenly lick a face
as dogs you can surely forgive
your mother
because she makes a funny dog
with frilly fur and worried eyes
and as a dog, is it so bad 
you spend so much time
recalling a certain smell
or staring too long and too intently
at a torn leaf in a hot tub 
a dog falls ill and says nothing
over time, they destroy the things they love
picture whoever is giving you trouble 
or whatever part of you desires more than it has
then see a dog 
pulling against the chain gripping his neck
or barely moving under a bench
watch the dog run away from everything it knows
do you blame them?"
Mementos of a Summer Day,"Escort
           your lady friend
Gather
           your kids. This
Is an family friendly
Event;
           of a life time.
Arrive early
           to secure good seating.
Up front is where you want to be.
Pack a picnic
           basket with cold sandwiches, coleslaw and iced
tea. Save
room for the barbecue
that will come later.
Lay out on your blanket.
Pose
for the photograph.
Grin.
Capture
personal mementos.
Indicators that you were here.
Pieces of a torn shirt.
A finger.
An ear.
           Put
it in a jar.
Seal
it.
           Pack
it in your pocket."
Summer and the City,"Summer nights cool came down
blotting heat like a kiss for colored children.
Heat surged
as we danced jagged up and down the street,
played hide and seek.
Last night, night before
Twenty-four robbers
at my door.
I got up
let em in
Hit em in the head
with a rollin pin.
All hid? Among the leaves
of church hedges
we smelled
something slow and splendid
in our sweat.
Our fathers we knew worked good
jobs that required muscle.
Our mothers in day work
used elbow grease and unwritten receipts
for smothered chicken and gravy,
caused white women to envy and delight.
Outside mothers waited for aid checks
and a long gone man; large women
on folding chairs
ate chunks of Argo starch.
Lean days, sugar sandwiches,
ketchup, or mayonnaise.
Missing meat a vague notion.
Love, manna.
Twilight, blessed the block,
poured from a dark man’s mouth
like a spout of Joe Louis milk,
our champion toast
heralding the greatest’s arrival
however long the getting there.
Slow rocking grandmothers
spit out words into small cans
held in their hands.
Their eyes trained on us
from Deep South porches
we never left behind.
Never left us.
Even after Exodus.
Mouths wide open, we drank
the evening’s pleasures.
Men, women who loved us more
than we could have known.
We were their quick, flashing hope-
                                              treasures.
The memory of us
Their milk.     Their honey."
Angelhair,"In the redcoat she (who is I) was
an angel, dark and bright.
Mama chose the drama:
pretty scarlet to subdue the white
walk, a world dumb with snow,
patentleather shoes to shine
the path over ice. My
father paid the way.
His teeth salt inside the grin.
I (who’s she) had a manner
of leaping toward a light
suddenly running into ecstasy
or heat, exquisitely blind
in the body racing inside it-
self. A little fit of imagining.
Thin arms, cropped wings,
to hold the bristly branches of fir, and sing-
ing, sisters and brothers itching,
happy from angelhair fine as a strand of cat
hair split six ways and brushed into the skin
to itch and itch again.
We were wild and giddy with gifts.
It was then and always as all souls itch and spin
in lit-red coats that float down this narrow vein,
so we spin in O, to someone who loves us
and suffers the world for each turn before a mirror,
quiet as ice, we fall all through at last
here in memory’s tiny Paradise."
The Love of Travelers,"At the rest stop on the way to Mississippi
We found the butterfly mired in the oil slick;
its wings thick and blunted. One of us, tender in the fingertips,
smoothed with a tissue the oil
that came off only a little;
the oil-smeared wings like lips colored with lipstick
blotted before a kiss.
So delicate the cleansing of the wings I thought the color soft as
      watercolors
would wash off under the method of her mercy for something so slight
and graceful, injured, beyond the love of travelers.
It was torn then, even after her kindest work,
the almost-moth, exquisite charity could not mend
what weighted the wing, melded with it,
then ruptured it in release.
The body of the thing lifted out of its place
between the washed wings.
Imagine the agony of a self separated by gentlest repair.
“Should we kill it?” one of us said. And I said yes.
But none of us had the nerve.
We walked away, the last of the oil welding the butterfly
to the wood of the picnic table.
The wings stuck out and quivered when wind went by.
Whoever found it must have marveled at this.
And loved it for what it was and
had been.
I think, meticulous mercy is the work of travelers,
and leaving things as they are
punishment or reward.
I have died for the smallest things.
Nothing washes off."
Orchard,"It’s fall, season of the apple—iconic
fruit of this America, mounds of excess
littering the grounds of orchards
from want of migrant hands to pick
the harvest clean: their red the banner
of every girl or woman who tips her head up
to the knowledge of her power—which means
she can see the way things work in the world,
and chooses not to be shamed any longer
for calling it. For what did the hissing
in the leaves tell her that she didn’t
already know, or the laughter behind
closed doors when she ran, groping
her way out? Don’t pretend you don’t
know what I want, said every snake
in the grass. Survival means no one
dies, but someone is forced to take
the fall: the smallest bird, the lowest
fruit—though the fruit isn’t to blame
for its sheen, nor the star for marking
the place where its light was last seen."
Why appropriation is not necessarily the same as mastery,"The child wants to know the names of all the herbs and spices on the shelf: those
roots floating in a jar like a stunted man treading water, those dried leaves
twisted carelessly with twine and left in the kitchen drawer.
Sounds made in a different tongue are often so enchanting— at the start, they are
like rain falling, plinking over looped chains in the garden.
Remember that things have names. It is important to know that one thing will
not always substitute for another. The beautiful berry leaves a dark stain on the
tongue, a body lifeless in its bed.
Remember that a syllable can be slighter than an eyelash. The way it flicks up or
down can mean a question, or your chin.
The violinist recounts a fairy tale of a boy kept years with others like him in
captivity. They buff the witch’s floors to the sheen of glass, gather the fine amber
dust in the air to bake into bread, the dewdrops in the hearts of roses to feed her
unslakable thirst.
Later, trying to remember, the one bewitched says phrases over and over. But
there is no one there to catch his mistakes, to help him put the pieces back
together.
And you, you’ve been such a good student of that epistemology, of thinking-into-
being: don’t you know that spells are made of words?
Remember too: not all saying is true.
I have heard another story: how the Pont de l’Archevêché groans with the weight
of hundreds of padlocks, etched with promises made to eternity. What happens
when the language of the promise is wrong, when the word for “expensive” is
used instead of “love?”
Do you glimpse my original shape beneath this overlay of form? The rain falls
and falls over the village. The tailor sews in his shop, the fiddler plays a tune by
the fire.
Arrival is recognition, which brings a catch in the throat. We weep when words
break through a surface. We weep when we have seen ourselves."
To unravel a torment you must begin somewhere,"—after Louise Bourgeois, “What is the shape of this problem” (1999)
Anything can be a thread: fossil
of a seahorse entombed in an earring
box, safety pin festooned
with four wrinkled cords.
A friend tells me
her daughter once confided:
I want a life
different from yours.
I’ve been there,
and also been that wish.
What could one do
with the moon’s floodlights
burning a hole in the sky?
I wanted to stand
in the aperture and be
seen—
and what I’ve wanted
may have come true
or not. I lay down
and let a body
press into mine, undo
the chaste buttons of red silk.
Afterwards, even the rain
could feel oracular. But what if
it’s part of our nature
to want to leave
more than a trace?
Even the moon doesn’t want to return
the comb stuck in its cheek.
The metal teeth bend
toward the river swells. Small
white wings paper the sides of a lamp—
Beautiful and unerring, whatever fate
singes with fire.
Out of the cold current I lift
and stack stones. I rub sticks together.
There are some things I can do.
There are some things I can’t take back."
Bethal Ridge Cemetary,"On the edge that time thins, I stood
with aching arms, in a wrinkled dress.
Among the stones a holier-than-thou,
dark-robed and flailing,
recited psalms by the shovelful.
It’s the body that feels pain,
but the brain delivers it.
To this day, sometimes driving
I see black wings flapping between
bare branches and overreact.
Someone once told me we make
everyone in our dreams into another
version of ourselves, that rage isn’t rage
but sorrow turned back on itself,
the shape made of regret.
There must have been birds,
the noon-time smell of grass.
I can’t say. Feathered arias
and earthy balms are not meant for
a woman with a fist in each pocket."
The Weeds In This Garden,"Long ago, I built a self outside myself.
I ate what my family ate, answered
to my name, but when they said let us pray,
I kept my eyes open. There is a price
to be paid for resistance. Whatever
you call me, I have called myself
worse, invented words made up
of letters from my own name.
Now the backs of my hands, all bone
and strain, I think cannot be mine.
Who hasn’t killed herself at least once,
only to grow into someone needier?
Who hasn’t bent with her wounds
to a mutinous patch, weeds
shooting up like false rhubarb,
every wisp, stem, and sodden pith
a testament? Who hasn’t scratched
at the question of what it means to be here?"
The Day I Learn Her Diagnosis,"I walk to clear my head.
There are no angels living under
the freeway overpass, no colors
where you are from, your brain
a jumble of neurons,
stretched and hiccupping.
Soon snow will come, fill
the negative space of your body’s
landing, erase all evidence
that once you painted a blank
canvas with your fear
unbuttoned. I have carried you
like a stone inside hope-emptied
pockets, like shame, like a word
I could not say out loud.
Now a voice, less heard than felt,
hallows my deepest parts,
opens me like a Bible.
Oh, Mama, can you picture it?
Me on my knees, the moon
in a mad orange flare."
Bones for Everyone,"when I wake up
violet rays burn down their warmth
on my arms
I feel it staggering—
beads of heat on skin
slight burns on flesh
the temperature dwindles down
to this
to me
I am not the beautiful
they want me to be
reach your hands inside
and find what you will:
maybe geraniums and thick thighs
I'll leave the windows open for you
what else am I?
a tongue made up of suns
another form of heat
dig deeper and you'll find
exoskeleton of a dictionary
cartilage of the verbose
I am all bones.
white bones
oleander bones
toxic bones
mint bones
red bones
bones from me to you
for me AND you
still bones
broken bones
what is in my bones
isn't just empathy and the obvious shattering
it's something the foxes like to bite down on
and run away with
and throw into the pyre
of granite rocks and bloodstones
make a bone stew and you'll taste longing
you'll taste the lonely
you'll taste the red threads
at the bottom of the pot
that tie my wrists down
to the ground
where eventually
I will become it."
Words Growing on Trees,"In observance of summer drought
the emerald trees look to me
as if I have a silver pail with an
endless bottom
             the source of answering thirst
Perhaps the silver pail
has been buried at the bottom
of the river
filled with weighted buttons
           life answers
We’re both thirsty
and have no answers
Only a question of how
a tree can birth a poem
and how a poet
never stops thirsting
Pull the buttons of
branches of
time well spent
never reach the bottom
             of words"
Cold Gin and a Pandemic,"A swig of fresh lime squeezed over ice
San Francisco’s Junipero gin with a garnish
soothes the overwhelm of more bad news
and sudden heat
What I learned at home today:
           the length of estrangement becomes short
           in comparison to the weight of regret
          100 more days of solitude—a poet’s irony
          bare white walls wait with open-hearts
          to catch our sighs
          how much I miss my father now that he is dead.
Toss back tonic water with an extra kick
catch the sun warming the side of my face
through the glass door into the dining room
now a reflection
of how many years have passed
          how the idea of a father became a ghost
          how a ghost haunted me into adulthood
          how adulthood became a poem always in the works
          how poems became home
          how hard it is to live inside this one"
"I, Lover","I shall never have any fear of love, 
Not of its depth nor its uttermost height,
Its exquisite pain and its terrible delight.
I shall never have any fear of love.

I shall never hesitate to go down
Into the fastness of its abyss
Nor shrink from the cruelty of its awful kiss.
I shall never have any fear of love.

Never shall I dread love’s strength
Nor any pain it might give.
Through all the years I may live
I shall never have any fear of love.

I shall never draw back from love
Through fear of its vast pain
But build joy of it and count it again.
I shall never have any fear of love.

I shall never tremble nor flinch
From love’s moulding touch:
I have loved too terribly and too much
Ever to have any fear of love."

"Diary from an AIDS Ward,1984","Never knew a thing about the Saint
Vincent, hearty name
a comforting stew
in a violent December
the first ward to welcome
the men who would become
my children until mothers
chose God over religion
love over blame
woke up from the stupor of shame
that worst of all AIDS complications
Jealous mothers
returned afraid
awake that I might take their place
after one found me in bed
putting love into lesions
fields of killer berries blue
heralds of final breaths
our bodies gently threaded in tenderness
word got around
the best doctors looked away
nurses never saw a thing
as we snuggled, giggled
careful not to unplug anything
the joy of Popsicles
the birthday cakes
the friends who came
the ones who didn’t
hard conversations
thinking about the daddy
you wish you had
made you mad
so many orphans of the living
be the daddy, don’t dream the daddy
daddy’s not coming
be the daddy you wish you had
don’t get jealous
get alive and live to the bone
of all the love you have to give
send your neighbor a prayer, a chocolate, a kiss
don’t miss the daddy, be the daddy
tell the bedtime story
we can all tuck each other in
be the daddy to the boy dying
days before you
become the breath you barely have
be the orchestra section of another’s life
the days endless with machines, medications
necessary interrogations
interruptions of sleep by front line miracle dreams
I wear my Reverend Mother disguise
so I can stay through the night
You make me promise
they’ll honor the DNR
no matter how you beg
whatever look of despair
comes into your eyes
You know what you want
while you still own your mind
When mama finally arrives
you’re still alive
I kiss you every time
always the chance of good-bye
The AIDS wards
Where lifetimes were lived
in moments.
Where Death wrapped us in the mercy
of seeing life for the very first time
the immortality
of Love threading body to soul
with tenderness.
Never gone too far."
La Biblioteca is a Doula,"When my saddle shoes were too big
so they might last beyond the year
I ran away from home
where yelling to be heard by the unheard
rattled in my skull; burial ground of secrets.
One foot met the other
like long lost friends
awkwardly skipping their way
into Saturdays, towards stacked
protective fortresses from
childhood’s dark labyrinths;
where underestimated
eyes of innocence
found immortal truths
understood more deeply
than the tall ones
with sour faces
who had dropped their smiles
on brutal roads of hunger,
on endless days of
earning just enough
from tightened fists
that grabbed too much.
The library door
where I found my Narnia.
Where I fell in love with Emerson.
Where I read Chinese women poets
and wrapped myself
in the silk of words,
of punctuation strung like pearls
stitching together the stops, the starts,
the questions, the breaths,
the echoes and exclamations unleashed
from a soul so new to the world,
so old to life.
Where I stood on tippy toes
to find the vast longings
of human history;
to find myself
gathering lost smiles
into dreamscapes of resilience.
Musty books perfumed my imagination.
Crisp new books fell open
in my tiny hands
like tomorrow’s gold that promised
there would always be enough
in the temple where anything
is possible.
Where now, pressing into
Winter’s whim I am consoled
by the Velveteen Rabbit."
Little Grey Dreams,"Little grey dreams,
I sit at the ocean’s edge,
At the grey ocean’s edge, 
With you in my lap.
I launch you, one by one,
    And one by one,
      Little grey dreams,
Under the grey, grey, clouds,
Out on the grey, grey, sea, 
You go sailing away, 
From my empty lap,
      Little grey dreams.
Sailing! Sailing!
Into the black,
At the horizon’s edge."
A Body’s Universe of Big Bangs,"A body must remind itself
to keep living, continually,
throughout the day.
Even at night while sleeping,
proteins, either messenger, builder,
or destroyer, keeps busy
transforming itself or other substances.
Scientists call these reactions
—to change their innate structure,
dictated by DNA—cellular frustration,
a cotton-cloud nomenclature for crusade,
combat, warfare, aid, unification,
scaffold, or sustain.
Even while the body sleeps, a jaw slackened
into an open dream, inside is the drama
of the body’s own substances meeting
one another, stealing elements,
being changed elementally,
altered by a new story
called chemical reaction.
A building and demolishment,
creating or undoing,
the body can find movement,
functioning organs, resists illness—
or doesn’t. Look inside every living being
and find this narrative of resistance,
the live feed of being resisted.
The infant clasping her fist
or the 98-year-old releasing
hers. This is how it should be,
we think, a long story carried out
to a soft conclusion. In reality,
little deaths hover and nibble,
little births opening mouths
and bodies the site of stories
and the tales given to us, and retold, retold,
never altered, and the ones forgotten,
changed, unremembered
until this place is made of only
ourselves. Our own small dictators,
peacemakers, architects, artists.
A derelict cottage,
a monumental church
struck in gold, an artist’s studio
layered with paints and cut paper,
knives and large canvas—
the site the only place
containing our best holy song:
I will live. I will live. I will keep living."
Cathedral,"Enter under the ribbed
vaulting, holding up
the pointed arch
girded by rigid piers
and those brave half-fallen buttresses.
I’m not there. No Gothic cathedral
in my heart.
Inside, not in the nave, the grand
rounded apse, or the light
coming through fractured glass
into the aisle, its pattern hungry for the sacred.
Not the broken pattern of sun
set on the floor.
Instead, I’m in the accident of wings—
look up, in the tower, black shudder and flight
and the light disturbed,
shifting on the faces of saints and martyrs
that darkening in the stone laid by the hands of slaves
and laborers, in the blessed display
made by their sun-deepened
palms, sweat. Poverty in their bodies
which did not keep them from making,
building, carrying one large rock onto another.
Each stone a high chorus of voices
that cannot die: Hoc est corpus meum.
—
The cashier hands me a sack of food—
black curl around her temple.
The woman and her brow
in the restaurant kitchen—
the back of her hand
wiping forehead.
No need to insert hungry
repetitions and pursuit of godliness
in the carving of men’s faces.
—
Which is the house
to which I direct prayer
and give thanks? Faces
in the turret that have never
been drawn, the relief
of their likeness carved inside
stone’s voice.
Am I there? Under your feet?"
The Bell,"The lights in the bedroom flickered off and on.
I lay in our bed listening to a heavy thumping
coming from somewhere, quickening.
In a half-dream, I created the idea of walking to the door
and shouting, Who’s doing that?
Even the thought of it was tiring, and I rolled over with eyes half-closed,
lucid enough to be afraid to sleep but longing for it
with the same urgency I longed to take a deep breath
without pain, or to be able to sit up
without my lungs feeling crushed.
I tried to fill my thoughts with something other
than the every-second-of-half-breathing, the crushing and stupor.
Was the sound growing near?
Was it a foot banging a door, my daughter running circles in the living
room, feet pounding in a rhythmic pattern?
Was it the neighbor at some task again that required loud repetitive
pounding and screeching?
The questions were something to latch onto in my mind. I entertained them.
A slit of light broke from the bedroom door and my son crawled in
beside me, wrapping his small limbs around mine
underneath the coat of blankets. He was whispering but I could not
hear because of the thumping.
Who is doing that, I said. I slept.
My husband woke me to feed me soup, water from a straw.
I sat up in bed, the room bluing. Our five-year-old
jumping on the bed, adding a beat to the drumming
that started again when I opened my eyes (though I was sure
I heard it in my sleep).
It had been weeks since I’d left either the bed, or the couch,
laying, blinking, and when awake, staring through the window,
at a wall, at one of the children’s faces.
Breath came as if through a tiny sieve, which I gulped in small pockets.
You’re here, the doctor said one morning on the phone.
Be grateful. So the air like fish eggs, like the meager rationing
in the form of pills.
Sucking, coughing, my chest strained and ready to snap.
Nebulizer hush and burr. Inhaler sip. Eight more times.
Times seven. Again. Times sixty days.
The world shimmered in blue, the faces of my son, my husband
and our girls, cast in that same blue.
One morning or one night, or the next day, or the night that was yesterday
and before, tomorrow, I dreamt of running at full speed
down our street, past the school, toward the bayou ten blocks away.
The banks were filling with rain, ready to break over the edge
of the concrete embarkment, and I ran so hard every part of me
ached and I knew that this feeling, familiar, happened yesterday,
today, and tomorrow. I woke up wheezing and choking.
The thumping in my ears, my own heart racing,
like I was running, every second running.
At the insistence of my husband, I sat outside wrapped in a blanket,
feeling shorn. I watched my children play in the front yard
while the light flickered through the leaves of the tree on the lawn.
Underneath the world—or was it beside it, along it, between it?
(There was no relative space to pin it)—I saw the pulsing of blue,
an under-color to the kaleidoscope of reality’s rough imagery—
my son’s kid sneakers of black and red and white, flashing lights
when he jumped, my-eight-year-old’s plastic sandals, both of the children
dangling off the edge of a spider swing, their small hands flayed out
and waving. The laughter, her sigh.
Underneath it all was this color, not an earthly blue, blue of ocean,
precious stone or gem cut into rock, a sky flanking a horizon. No.
This blue which was not blue was the color of sacred, deep,
with a center to it, blood of childbirth, the whitened lips of the dead,
the infant’s purple wail—
all of it mixed together, long and unraveling, a cruel silence
with a terrifying bell inside.
I rested my head back on the chair and stared at the sky
that was no longer the sky.
I blinked and felt close to that color—this underwater, the blue eggs,
blue veins on an infant’s foot, the black feather of a blue jay that feigned
blue, the blue mouth of a glacier.
Was this what ran parallel and twinned to our lives,
a universe linked with a battered rope to this one,
where I had died, and hanging by a thread
to the universe where I lived.
The giant bell in its cruel silence behind the blue,
and my rollercoaster heartbeat readying me for the terrifying drop
to the ground. I longed to hear the bell.
I would not share it, only save it inside my body,
and never, even to my worst enemies, (but is that true?)
tell anyone the sound it made that killed small parts
all at once with a blow.
I opened my eyes, heavy pinned.
I had already heard the bell.
I had already imagined my children without me.
I sat feeling the holes of it,
growing cold.
Light overhead grew brighter
until wind threw the branches together,
a dark shadow enveloping our family.
Spin faster, I said to my children.
Do it again."

A Short History of Journey,"The fault, dear Arcturus, is not in your star.
I’m afraid we misread the swells
like explorers mistaking one continent for another.
“Columbus stretched out Asia eastward until Japan almost kissed the Azores.”1
“The Chinese treasure fleet had been mothballed long before Magellan set to sea.”2
In other words, they were imprecise, and they perished.
(Behold the flight of birds on rarefied air,
from breeding ground to wintering ground.
Behold intention, and its kin, precision.)
Be that as it may, we were always meant for motion.
See how the Silk Road was paved with horses’ bones.
And more than smuggled silkworm, it brought sugar, silver,
paper—utter world changer.
See how the Spice Trade flourished,
shoring up an empire, its galleons—implacable bearers of a slave
trade from Manila to Acapulco.
The world got its cinnamon, its cocoa, its cassia and cardamom,
its lapis lazuli, and its Balas Ruby—ancient and sapphire-veined.
We got wanderlust.
And the bravest of us looked up and remembered everything—
the fixed star, the dippers, the king, the queen, the bear-keeper—
rubescent and fourth brightest in all the night sky, dearest,
remembered also the cardinal of old fields and every roadside—
brilliantly blue and sometimes true—in the same night sky,
roaming its way home.

Haint Blue,"To free yourself of the haint,
you need to vanquish it.
Paint your porch
the color of water
which is power,
with the might to scatter
blue light to the green
of seawater. But remember
how heavy color can be.
How shades of blue
came from true indigo,
which needed an abundance
of water and limestone
above the bedrock before
it became a cash crop,
which needed to be pounded
and crushed, and dusted
with wood ash to make
blue cakes, which was the currency
of slavery: a bolt of cloth
dyed indigo for one human body.
But mixed with lime and some
white mineral, it resembled water
which haints could not cross over."
Legacy,"To tell her story, you must know when
to put courage in a matchbox and conceal
it in a loaf of bread. You must learn how
a message betokened deliverance
when courage is simply a word someone
wrote on a slip of paper and the sweet
scent of bread could no longer sustain you.
You must grasp your other hand with what
grit remains, growing and unyielding.
To tell her story, you must walk in her shoes.
If forced out of your leased farmland,
don’t forget to bring rice if you can pack
only what you can carry. And if
your mother did not speak inside the bus
with the windows covered with brown paper
on the way to the barracks, it was only
because she was praying that you would not be
housed in the horse stall with the manure
whitewashed over. And if you were, she was
deciding what to do about the smell.
To tell her story, you must remember
the landscape from behind barbed
wire fences. You must gaze at your body
and know its history, look beneath
the tender, ridged scars and see the bone
protruding out of your right arm
and hole the size of a football
on your right thigh, wondering how
the lights never went out. You must
look at the image of your grandmother
with the weight of rammed earth against
what you survived. To tell her story,
you must say a prayer, not of sorrow,
but of grace. You must loosen the earth,
pick daffodils to the base of the stem,
remember your roots and ordinary days,
and the grit under your fingernails,
the way your grandmother taught you."
Almost Majnun,"  Dedicated to the missing children of war, 911, United Nations Day, 2002. The word majnun means mad or crazy in many languages.
I am almost majnun—majnun
searching for you in the cinders of cement

Rat fowl of urban rot

Are you pecking her remains from hardened asphalt?
I am lost without her.

She disintegrated into a sky burial of trade.

He was renamed the falling man.
He has joined the blood river of twisted carcass.

She was tortured by a regime that looks like you
Lacerated in the spin of piano wire,

a lily pad sinking in the Mediterranean.

You did see him, your brother.
You swallowed him in the gasp of television.
He is branded to the inside of your eyelids.
Descending in the blink of horror, he lives in you.
He is a tear gland squatter
a perpetual spiral down a landscape of eye.

over hallucinations of me falling
beyond the debris of ethnic sterilization
I am skinless and blue—almost majnun.

I am lost without her.
Her picture hangs from my neck like a stethoscope.
Her eyes are of Christ, jeweled mocha orbs.
I am looking for her in the dusk flake of air,
in the incidental pauses between words.
A morphine drip pats time silent.
I am looking for her in the dehydration of African bush
in the diarrhea of Zanzibar
in a vial of Pedialyte.
She died the death of a sanctioned Iraqi girl
no boundaries in sand dug outs
no penicillin on Acacia trees
no united way for a sickled tarnished penny.
She has joined the blood river of twisted carcass.
My eyelids are screens to
the backdrop of his tumbling tomb.
The fallen man is falling.
Some anonymous cadaver is falling.
He is the rain of descending graves
prostituted bird droppings
falling vertical assembly line
stock falling into a Korean labor of child heap
falling into the noise of majnun
crowd space crashing skulls of shattered mosaics
into the open cave of zero
falling down into the urban scrotum of Harlem
into the closed palate of chocolate slavery
into decapitated Taser breath
into forgotten blankets of small pox
you know those forgotten blankets of small pox
Trail of Tears—Trail of Tears
heart falling heat fixed into the stain of microbes
into an anthrax wail of crows
falling up the vertebrae of post-modernist architecture
Have you seen Mary, Maryam, Malaika, Marta?
Ah, Marta
Her hair is rain forests, each strand a disciple of its own.
She is almost majnun.
The plague of chemical lake pumps her veins.
Her nipples are a leaky dioxin faucet.
Her baby is a dowry traded to the North Star.
It is a unicorn born deformed in the raw sewage
of Guatemala.
I am almost majnun.

Have you seen?"
Remember Re mem ber ing,"Before the beginning
before the rising sun
before the thought of future
before the prayer of separation
world torn from worlds
before sea crept from earth by moon beam
before moon
before desert
when all was a black dot.
Before the beginning
when motion was the only religion
lonely then too
I evoked a cover folded you into a womb and
beckoned beckoned
for you to form me from under an ignited sky
of ocean.
And in the rich exchange of cyclic respiration
and in the deep marbling of spirit
we created the air and spilled our progeny into
the soundless flight of flickering novae.
Before the beginning
before I became aware of myself you were there
my beloved my projection my constant.
You were the light floating a walk across
a montage of darkness.
Before my brain could see
you were the humble mind of space
my betrothed. You are the fourth dimension
time in a feminine envelope the clock of my spirit
my germ dormant is the tick of your memory
theology of heart.
For 66 trillion eons I searched the unseen for you
exiled from my center.
Oh my core, do you not recognize your living ancestor?
I am the broth of your tears.
You look to me through the glazed fever of forget
Alzheimer’s of the soul!
Even when you were sightless you
were yet a bed of vision.
Spiritual amnesia is surely my sorrow."
A Doctor Tells Us It’s Not a Life or Death Situation,"Before my daughter’s lungs
found a consistent rhythm,
they were off beat. Coming in
on the one, one, three, two. Unsteady
and unsettled. Too fast, and not
finishing the notes. The nurses
are worried. Concerned
with her cadence. My mother was
once scared for mine because
she found Live Through This
on my nightstand. It was a threat.
A kind of music she didn’t
understand. A specialist comes
and gives us the notes my daughter
should be playing. He sounds like
sheet music of worry. I tell myself she
is already a fan of Ornette Coleman.
Or Autechre. Imagine that: A baby
who’ll skip lullabies for bebop and
experimental electronic music. Instead,
they hook her up like a drum machine,
wires everywhere. Measuring her
beats. One, one, three, two eventually becomes
one, two, three, four. I don’t remember
what it was like when my lungs
arrived under water, already expert
swimmers. More fish than flesh. I just
know what it feels like to be a new
parent. In and out of emotional control,
drowning in panic before everything
finds its steady pulse."
The America I Know Could Use a Good Cry,"I met America at a neighborhood bar.
He offered me a shot of rum and I reminded him
that Captain Morgan was a slave owner,
so the bartender awkwardly slipped another
liquid lie down my throat. I ordered another drink
and was channeled by dark spirits. The courage of
black ghosts who haunt American dreams.
I told him I loved him and I wanted him to sleep well.
“But I know I’ve been in your nightmares,”
I said. “I want to be your friend, but only if it’s a deep
relationship. Only if you show me that you are not scared
of your baggage. Bring your whole history to the table.”
America cracked open another beer as a tear
ran down his face. He said,
“I was born in a house not my own, and my fathers demanded
that their portraits hang on every wall. White paint covers each
brown brick and our backyard is a museum of unmarked graves.”
“Despite this, a garden grows,” I said. “And every home
can be torn down and rebuilt again.”
“But I’ve been told I shouldn’t completely let you in,” he said.
“Some people in my family stand in the doorway,
blocking the entrance.”
He left before I could tell him that my people have a history
of finding ways inside broken spaces and making them whole again."
Remote Disjunctions,"I didn’t mind ferns enough, I thought, the last time I hiked
up to Lookout Point. They’re so unassuming. I’d be looking up
to the tops of third-generation redwoods, or beyond, toward
Googleplex, in Mountain View, which later Google confirmed
was the complex off in the distance. And I’d be picturing,
those last days, cages and tents. Sorry to make you feel judged,
I almost texted. Stopped myself. Truth is I judge, and if judges
were capable of feeling sorry, they wouldn’t. I welcomed noise
instead of trying to block it out with the folk musician’s songs,
Scottish, coming from my laptop. If you don’t remember a name,
does it mean you don’t care to remember. You’d taken yourself
to places whose specifics you’d chosen to forget. You said you
weren’t there to keep track, but to experience. Which, when
I’m feeling negative, I translate as ditching the thing as soon as
you’re done with it onto the heap of junk you’re not accumulating.
Those who get the backend know what detailed tagging can lead to:
a map so precise it’s the territory’s size. We’re drifting apart
again, spore-like. I’m done completing your sentences.
A version of the signs along the trail anticipating the hikers’ ups
and downs. “It begins with feeling,” was the first, spotted
at the same time I noticed the pet waste bags someone had left
behind. “Here you leave your worries,” seen after I passed a guy
whose grin was such, he did seem to have just dumped them.
This one got me thinking about our tendency to ruin things:
“This is a beautiful moment.” The last wasn’t part of the art:
“Please keep out of area under renovation.” That resonated. "
Commas,"Came home and found my typewriter
case a little crushed it’s my fault
probably for leaving it looking like
a stepping stone for someone not tall
enough to climb onto the toy chest
but who very much likes to clamber
up there my father built the toy chest
for me and now the result is my comma
key sticks won’t fly up to make its mark
so no more clauses of that tender
kind or just imagine them there or figure
out how to use a semicolon or type the word
comma when I need one lots of things
are called commas not just punctuation
a certain butterfly a bacillus responsible for cholera
the chest’s nails are slowly withdrawing I notice
pulling themselves out in the invisible
hammerclaw of time or else the wood itself’s
ejecting them feeling maybe hey it’s been long
enough let me just be planks again or it could
be the climbing itself did I also climb
and all that climbing’s worked
against those nails a little each time after
my father held one in his hand one in his
mouth and with his hammer made a box"
Disintegrating Calculus Problem,"A dramatic clue lodged in a rockface. Set in a shimmering sound belt slung around the grasses. Collections of numbers signify a large sum, a fatness that cannot be touched. Numbers are heart weight in script. Calculus means a small pebble pushed around maniacally. Binding affection, instead of fear, to largeness.
Ideas are peeled into fours and pinned on the warm corners of earth to flap in a wind. Wind, the product of a swinging axe that splits the sums. This math flowers on the tender back of the knee. An operatic leaf in the tree uses a secret algebra to perforate dense void. The void behaves as a porous slice of rye bread spread thick with salted butter.
Food is braided into the body. On the watchface of the lake, a felled tree trunk keeps protracted time. Circling vaguely like the day does. The circle is dented by the dense tear of a woman without the thing she needs. A loudness about need has a reverse effect. The loud need loses mass. This new thinned need is braided into a story archived in a dark library inaccessible to the public.
The tear weighs the same as a loaf of rye bread. The circle is made of birthday wishes glued together with morning sun mucus. Whatever is hidden is pluckable in time, even sound and meaning. Wind deserves a trophy for revealing this elegantly."
Mourning,"5 AM—the world is silent save for the heater 
in the hallway, the cars wooshing
down the main road, the vibrato of
every single driver. Every creak of a settling
house. Lay my head down, press it into pillow.
On the window sill a jar of coins,
sunlight crawling through the
water in an empty spaghetti jar.
A spider settles itself into the warmth
of my house. Inside the body: ghosts
of IVs, needles, feeling
breathless in a hospital bed. 
Somewhere inside my brain aware 
of the machine pumping oxygen,
beeping, attached by wires to the chest.
In the chest, an animal. The animal
forgetting how: to howl, to crawl, 
to find the words."

Voice Clear As,"When my mom discovers heaven’s just a noise festival
the godchoir of all her loves breathing
unsnagged by asthma or Newport-dragged lung
the true song life makes untethered from a body
tugged at last from the men who hold its reins
will she blame her pastors (like I did)
for Sunday portraits of pooled white gold?
Will she miss the wooden flute of her body
mourn the days corner-propped, cloaked in dust
too pious to disturb a room’s skin cells
and stray hair with her sound
snapped awake at the nightmare of a slip fringe
the private note sung aloud?
Or, unburdened by hell
will she exhale
and hear the bells?"

A note on this poem, an invitation:
Oh noon, the letter ن, intoning the -n- sound, pronounced noon. 
A Semitic letter, really, in Arabic, Aramaic, Hebrew, and through some 
starcrossed lineage, it has a cousin in Sanskrit, maybe even the same DNA. 
Some say the letter got its shape from an Egyptian hieroglyph of a snake. 
Some say the snake morphed into a whale, a fish, a dolphin. In the Qur’an, 
the Surah of The Pen begins by saying that the ن and the pen are in the act of 
writing, as if the ن were capable of script, were it not script itself. Were it not 
a snake, a whale, a palimpsest. What writes us as we write it. In Arabic class, 
Professor Hani drew a ن on the board and asked us what it looked like. 
He wanted us to say a cup. We saw an ark instead, a boat. And true, 
the ancients believed it might be a cup. And true, the scholars 
believe it to be a boat, holding a seed, the seed of the universe, 
awaiting rebirth after apocalypse. Birth, as in pregnant 
womb, though this isn’t in the scholarly texts. 
Some liken it to a setting sun. 
And Jonah, prophet who found God in the whale. 
The floating diacritical dot, Jonah escaping death. 
A noon as the beginning and end of existence. 
These days, in Iraq, in Syria, elsewhere 
being ravaged by death squads, 
a symbol is painted on people’s doors.

June Sunset,"Here shall my heart find its haven of calm,
By rush-fringed rivers and rain-fed streams
That glimmer thro’ meadows of lily and palm.
Here shall my soul find its true repose
Under a sunset sky of dreams
Diaphanous, amber and rose.
The air is aglow with the glint and whirl
Of swift wild wings in their homeward flight,
Sapphire, emerald, topaz, and pearl.
Afloat in the evening light.
A brown quail cries from the tamarisk bushes,
A bulbul calls from the cassia-plume,
And thro’ the wet earth the gentian pushes
Her spikes of silvery bloom.
Where’er the foot of the bright shower passes
Fragrant and fresh delights unfold;
The wild fawns feed on the scented grasses,
Wild bees on the cactus-gold.
An ox-cart stumbles upon the rocks,
And a wistful music pursues the breeze
From a shepherd’s pipe as he gathers his flocks
Under the pipal-trees.
And a young Banjara driving her cattle
Lifts up her voice as she glitters by
In an ancient ballad of love and battle
Set to the beat of a mystic tune,
And the faint stars gleam in the eastern sky
To herald a rising moon."
Seashells,"I picked up shells with ruby lips
  That spoke in whispers of the sea,
Upon a time, and watched the ships,
    On white wings, sail away to sea.
The ships I saw go out that day
    Live misty—dim in memory;
But still I hear, from far away,
    The blue waves breaking ceaselessly. "
The Two Horses (A Memory),"You said you had lunch in Pittsfield, was it on North Street?
That reminds me of when we lived on the farm.
It must be eighty years ago.
We went to a one-room schoolhouse, didn’t you drive past it once?
Each row was a different grade.
I sat in the first seat of the first row.
The teacher’s name was Miss Brown.
She was so pretty.
I wonder if she’s still alive.
The day before we left the farm our cat disappeared.
We couldn’t find her anywhere.
I was sad for weeks.
Three months later she showed up at our new house in Pittsfield.
Robbins Avenue.
I can’t think of the number now.
My sister was in New York.
She didn’t like the people she was living with so she’d visit us.
She fell in love with the young man who lived next door.
Maurice.
Your uncle Maurice.
They got married and moved to Cleveland.
They’re both gone now, aren’t they?
You know, I can’t picture her.
A few years later we moved to New York.
This just jumped into my mind: I must have been three years old.
We were still in Russia.
Mir.
A small town, but famous for its yeshiva.
My oldest brother—Joe—took our horses down to the river.
They were the two best horses in the town.
My father had a phaeton.
A beautiful old buggy.
He was like a taxi driver, he took people to Minsk.
Or Vilna.
That day he was at the station.
The passenger station, waiting for customers.
My brother was still just a kid.
He must have been washing the horses in the river.
I can remember—it was a hot day.
Maybe he was giving them a drink.
And while I was watching the reins got caught around a pole in the river.
The horses kept twisting the reins around that pole.
It was slippery, the reins kept sliding down under the water and they were pulling the horses down with them.
I ran into town and got my father who came running back with a knife in his teeth.
He jumped into the river with all his clothes on.
He took the knife and sawed away at the reins until he finally cut through.
He saved the horses.
I haven’t thought about this in a thousand years.
It’s like a dream: you get up it’s forgotten.
Then it all comes back.
Didn’t I ever tell you?
Look at me, I’m starting to cry.
What’s there to cry about?
Such an old, old memory, why should it make me cry?"

I mean, my life is wasted on my life
requirement is simple

Interrogation of an Alternate Timeline,"On a dusty rooftop in Giza, I tell Imam,
in another life, he and Hugh would have been
the best of friends. I picture Hugh, taking him
by the arm down the corniche
or the Cape, the cool night air refusing
silence. I hear their strings and tubes cutting through
beaming crowds in Imbaba and Soweto. Miriam
is serenading an open sea, clicking to the wind
by El Montaza. I see Biko
and Negm, side by side, in a crowded auditorium,
a whole generation huddled
around their voices. This is to say, in another
life revolution would be but
abstract. Biko would be a doctor,
perhaps in Durban. There would be no trains
for Hugh to sing of, save for those
that would bring him back to his loved
ones, safely. Negm would only be known
for love poems. What more
could one ask for? Let us not cheer
for those who would rather die
as soldiers when there is no
war. My whole life I have envied
the kind of thirst for music
that can be quenched by
Elvis and Sinatra. I have prayed
nightly for those I have idolized
to find a good night’s sleep
before deadly fame. What good is poetry
if it kills the poet? In another life, what must be said
here is but fairytale, ghost stories
for the rowdy children. Kanafani would live
in Acre, Baldwin would die
in Harlem, neither knowing the taste
of exile. I would write of bees
and clocks. I would not need men’s solemn
crooning to put me
to sleep. I would not mourn
the dead."
Pastoral,"I watched my old life go by like television.
Slopes of grass whipping against bright blue skies,
Objects some called tools 
And others, totems.
A woodpile, a sheepskin, 
Garlic curing from the rafters;
A river’s loose slaps upon slabs of warm rock.
“Secret spot” read the caption disseminated 
Online. Coy copy. Cool 
Said the flatlanders 
Whose ranks I’d effectively joined.
While those I left drifted closer to one another 
Or God, to the sources 
Of life itself: children and dirt. Unkept
By the present tense, I was distant 
In my watching,
An existence I too tendered stagily 
As free. Like television, 
I was buying
Whatever was for sale
As the appraisers said You don’t seem like you’re from there. 
But I simmered in the grid
Of there’s off-the-grid life: the flowing virtue 
Of verdant surfaces, 
The cemented-down conclusion 
That meaning must be near.
The siren song soft focus of my own 
Slushy memories reenacted 
By someone else.
Good enough I brushed their expiration from my view.
I watched the endless plot 
Of daily benedictions over the land.
The land—
O—
Any of you could feel 
You were alive in its popular image."

Ode to the Sun,"How many scenes, O sun,
Hast thou not shone upon!
How many tears, O light,
Have dropped before thy sight!
How many heart-felt sighs,
How many piercing cries,
How many deeds of woe,
Dost thy bright light not know!
How many broken hearts,
That are pierced by sorrow’s darts
How many maddened brains,
That are wild with passion’s rains;
How many soul-sick lives,
Stabbed with despair’s sharp knives,
Hast thou above the skies,
Not seen with thy radiant eyes!
Shine on, majestic one!
Shine on, O glorious sun!
And never fail to cheer
My life so dark and drear.
Whene’er thou shinest bright,
And show thy brilliant light,
The cares I know each day
Silently steal away."

Last Best Niche,"found language from Brideshead Revisited
When I was seventeen,
ecstasy disguised itself as vice:
juicy, offensive, and easy—
pretty things want to get rough.
an impertinent affair of the heart & more than the heart,
when I was seventeen. 
Tipsy virgins viced their pimples
when I was seventeen,
and transformed pretty things to indecisive cornsilk. 
When I was seventeen I said
I give up, finding no keener pleasure than a dear
or unnatural boys in ecstasy.
My partner, the obscure other,
was very naughty and kind
insatiable as our affairs, 
so I gave up and let myself be offensive—
a juicy piece of impertinence 
when I was seventeen,
wearing coloured tails obscured
by poppies, hearts, and deers:
no thing could give me keener pleasure.
Come back! I’ll be keenly offensive!
whispered, when I was seventeen
and transformed the popping juice of pleasure.
With meaty boys, a juicy little piece 
of vice, when I was seventeen.
And with others? Pleasure. Hullabaloo. Ecstasy. 
The heart’s juicy poppy,
its rough pimples, its kindness—blasphemous.
I gave up more than my heart."
Sonnet—Baugmaree,"A sea of foliage girds our garden round,
        But not a sea of dull unvaried green,
        Sharp contrasts of all colours here are seen;
The light-green graceful tamarinds abound
Amid the mangoe clumps of green profound,
        And palms arise, like pillars gray, between;
        And o'er the quiet pools the seemuls lean,
Red,—red, and startling like a trumpet's sound.
But nothing can be lovelier than the ranges
        Of bamboos to the eastward, when the moon
Looks through their gaps, and the white lotus changes
        Into a cup of silver. One might swoon
               Drunken with beauty then, or gaze and gaze
               On a primeval Eden, in amaze."
Ways to Disappear,"In the dark
Down a stairwell
Through the doorway
Gone west
With a new wish
In daylight
Down the sidewalk
In a wool coat
In a white dress
Without a name
Without asking
On your knees
On your stomach
Gone silent
In the backseat
In the courtroom
In a cage
In the desert
In the park
Gone swimming
On the shortest night
At the bottom of the lake
In pieces
In pictures
Without meaning
Without a face
Seeking refuge
In a new land
Gone still
In the heart
With your head bowed
In deference
In sickness
In surrender 
With your hands up
On the sidewalk
In the daylight
In the dark"
"All Along, I Laid, Halved","The lake was (all along) a reservoir.        
                                My third grade trip was to a dam. 
All along, I wore nothing but hand me down sweaters.
                               I grow at the mercy of my mother. 
Everytime. I height. At the mercy. Of someone. Else.
                                When I put my forehead on the floor fives times a day.
It will be game over.
                               My third grade self played squash.
My third grade self could have continued playing squash.
                               A child is an investment to a future.
Because now. 26. Fat. Drenched dreaming. Of figure skating. 
                               I can’t even sit straight. I look out of windows.
Do you know what a country smells like?
                               Not home. Never home. (All along) Not me.
Smells like teen spirit.
                                Smells like sweat moustache.
Smells like mercy lighting up a dam.
                                Every sleep I was consumed by a bonfire. No music. No dance. 
I don’t hate it here.
                                I don’t hate it anywhere.
But it’s hard hearing my mother cry on the toilet.
                                It’s hard hearing the winter knock up New York.
It’s hard breathing in smog and realizing (all along) it was Lahore.
                                All along, it was just me.
But did I even know?
                               In third grade, I ate a whole box of chalk.
In third grade, I witnessed a freed pigeon return to where it was homed.
                               In third grade, they found me. Without proof. At the squash court. Hustled.
I only know ill.
                               I only know mercy.
God.
                               Have mercy.
I spend my day shifting light bulbs to create company with my shadow.
                               I spend my day resting halved in warmth and shade.
I know what it will take to not burn me.
                               But I do not step out of the house.
And the house never steps out of me."

Looking at the Moon After Rain,"Translated by Florence Ayscough and Amy Lowell
The heavy clouds are broken and blowing,
And once more I can see the wide common stretching beyond the four sides of the city.
Open the door. Half of the moon-toad is already up,
The glimmer of it is like smooth hoar-frost spreading over ten thousand li.
The river is a flat, shining chain. 
The moon, rising, is a white eye to the hills;
After it has risen, it is the bright heart of the sea.
Because I love it—so—round as a fan,
I hum songs until the dawn."
Felt Flowers,"The play room’s alphabet pattern padding could be pulled apart, then
repositioned; after snack, the older, all-day boys—who tore off,
one by one, the turtles’ shells, a hippo’s quiet heft, and fed
the bashful ones their heads—huddled around their stockpile of
letters and laid out a dirty word that made the other kids
giggle or gasp and Miss Margaret tap the backs of their hands with
the yellow wooden yardstick. I couldn’t read yet.
I wouldn’t talk, either;
                              my language was the felt
flowers in the clear plastic tub, at the back table by the window, which
looked out at the slide, glistening like a tongue in
the brash noon light. An older boy stole
my poppy, so I assembled a pansy, pre-cut
by Miss Margaret at her house after school. I imagined her
pouring over a private abundance 
of patterned scissors for the jaggedness of a lily’s leaf, then the sturdy
kitchen shears for a pile of rose petals. Years later, she’d return beneath
the tangled top sheet of dreams, and before I could smooth
the intrusion in me, a muscle-drenched arm—veins like a textbook’s
anatomical orchid, dense hair
like my father had—guided her two fingers farther
into the scissor’s doubled gape—
                                                  Blistering then in the fully-bloomed heat,
the swings seemed to rock, but within themselves, the way
a lightbulb, untouched for years, holds a spasm
in its tungsten, a self-possessed momentum, awaiting fingers
on the switch. A group of girls, that day, trudged over, 
at Miss Margaret’s insistence, barrettes wincing above their ears, 
the button I’d cut from my best Sunday dress a makeshift bud 
atop a glue glob smear. They asked me if I wanted
to play house. I set my pink felt down.
                                              I didn’t know I could be the father, so
I said I’d be the dog. They named me Princess. One girl put on
an apron, white plastic pearls. Two others, fabric dolls in hand,
the daughters. One adhered
                                    a costume mustache and a voice
absurdly low. We arranged the mats by color for the rooms in our
make-believe home. I played my part; I laid in the yard, 
on the green pieces, the letters, an F, an A. My job, I’d decided, was not
to bound into the room, pretend-panting at my family’s feet,
with the whimper
                         dogs give when they want to be loved, but—
watching Miss Margaret tend to the bullies, our tiny table set, 
the family complete, curled up in
my own constant obstinate heat—to guard my made-up post,
on the bladeless lawn, alone, even if anyone called my name."
"September 23, 2016","When did you first know you were bisexual?
I will never know how the pleasure I give feels as a body receives it. 
I fear strangers, Naomi, even the ones I love. I count their turned backs on the subway.
Some nights I fear even the subway itself—or is it my reflection in the yellowed glass, how I cannot see the city moving beyond me?
I want each round mirror to open as a window might.
Perhaps I always knew, but I mistrusted my knowing. I once stacked my journals to the height of a beloved and embraced them.
Every poem I’ve read to you has been written in this direction. Each word a line on the map I haven’t yet finished that leads me to you.
In college, I got ready for a party with two women I loved who loved each other.
I watched Diana flip Jean’s hair from her freckled shoulders before zipping her into her dress: 
the same gesture I’d made in the mirror, alone, before I arrived at their apartment.
I watched them pass Jean’s mascara wand fluently between them, one’s licked fingers curling the other’s lashes, and a question split me at my spine—
like a hand gently cracking a new book’s cover, ready to understand."
The Blue-Green Stream,"Translated by Florence Ayscough and Amy Lowell
Every time I have started for the Yellow Flower River,
I have gone down the Blue-Green Stream, 
Following the hills, making ten thousand turnings,
We go along rapidly, but advance scarcely one hundred li.
We are in the midst of a noise of water,
Of the confused and mingled sounds of water broken by stones,
And in the deep darkness of pine trees.
Rocked, rocked,
Moving on and on, 
We float past water-chestnuts
Into a still clearness reflecting reeds and rushes.
My heart is clean and white as silk; it has already achieved Peace;
It is smooth as the placid river.
I love to stay here, curled up on the rocks, 
Dropping my fish-line forever."
Kumulipo,"Hawaiian creation chant 
At the time that turned the heat of the earth,
At the time when the heavens turned and changed,
At the time when the light of the sun was subdued
To cause light to break forth,
At the time of the night of Makalii (winter)
Then began the slime which established the earth,
The source of deepest darkness.
Of the depth of darkness, of the depth of darkness,
Of the darkness of the sun, in the depth of night,
                                It is night,

When Struck by Night,"For our new apartment, which my mother may never see
since slugging into that old person’s disease—I won’t bring myself
to say it in writing—I bought a cactus and it’s beautiful,
its soldier-green skin and feline-whiskered dress howls
beneath the den light which encourages me to keep my big-boy jeans on.
I know I look for answers everywhere. Everywhere there you are
with your eyes a war-less country, a privilege we sometimes share.
But tonight, there isn’t a country. Just a sky fussing. Anxious music.
The classic duty of breath as we binge another episode of
What Should I Do When You Want to Die. Sometimes, you fail
to love me, I think I say, the math ain’t mathing—but what could you do?
You’ve researched plants, I know, to find which could live
without much gusto from its human. You pour yourself
another glass of vodka, a shot of tequila for me. Who am I
to think I’m too good for your anger—you were right…
Come, let’s sour our swords together. Come, let morning waltz
into our bedroom all cocky-like like it landlords the place. Come,
let’s plunge forward, drunkenly in love, grab hold the darkness we become."
In the Beginning,"In the beginning, there was your mouth:
soft rose, rose murmur, murmured breath, a warm
cardinal wind that drew my needle north.
Magnetic flux, the press of form to form. 
In the beginning, there was your mouth—
the trailhead, the pathhead faintly opened,
the canyon, river-carved, farther south,
and ahead: the field, the direction chosen.
In the beginning, there was your mouth,
a sky full of stars, raked or raking, clock-
wise or west, and in the close or mammoth 
matter, my heart’s red muscle, knocked and knocked.
In the beginning, there was your mouth,
And nothing since but what the earth bears out."
Muscular Fantasy,"For October
I was thinking about that museum 
with just the one painted stamp people 
pay big money to stare at minimum 
an hour at a time by a painter of people
who have been old for a very long time. 
Sarah Beth Bess of Peducah, Old Walter Thom
outside Paris Island, the most senior clients
of most of the low country senior homes.   
There used to be a country where no sad
songs were allowed out loud because 
making the king blue was outlawed. 
The girl falling down the well sang without pause 
as she fell. People described it as gospel.
The boy in the well sang as well as a small bell 
& the people said it sounded like babble.
Rising in life-like detail from the middle 
of the stamp sized painting is an ornate mountain. 
My people moved further south to the beaches 
instead of moving north after reconstruction. 
“Blessed,” my father said when I asked if he’d 
rather be blessed or lucky. Soda in a can taste better 
than soda in a bottle but beer in a bottle 
taste better than beer in a can. It’s better
plus less stressful to think the best of people.
The worst thing about scared people 
is they go around scaring other people. 
Who you are with your mamma, People, 
is not who you are with other people.
The color of my mother’s thumbs up emoji 
is unchanged either because she’s not estranged 
by such things or because she doesn’t know 
the shade of her thumb can be changed. 
The painter can be seen painting a small 
painting through the window of a modestly
decorated cabin on the mountain. With all 
the people who clap when some mostly 
vengeful violence happens in the movie, 
those who do not clap may feel no other people 
are not clapping. I hear you. It seems  
reasonable to stare at a painting for at least 
as long as it takes the painter to make it 
& also reasonable to stare for approximately 
as long as it takes the sun to rise & set.
I told my father being blessed was vaguely 
more dependent on the whims of God. 
I’d rather be lucky. The girl in the well 
was put there in the name of god
by farming people. The boy fell."
"I Don't Say Goodbye, I Only Say Ciao—","What bloody lense holds firm between this mystery & us? Two shiny crows 
tapping intelligently on the glass of a dream.
              Please! Do not make me do the human things—
I must tend to my many plankton realities, 
                          must be off with my better self:
                                                                            One million faces lined 
                          along a mirrored tunnel & in each that same tricky knot begging.
You couldn’t know how long I suffered over it, my long waiting at the end of the maze.
I can only guess what you think I’m after,             stretching in the mirror 
while you rattle on about sabotage,
                                                       an old tension springing in the body."
Hypothesis,"Whether it’s true
that the moth mistakes the candle’s flame 
for the moon or the bioluminescent 
pheromones of another moth,
I can’t say.
I was the candle. 
I was the flame
conceived in and by reason of 
darkness, nibbling on a darkening wick. 
When moth after moth after moth 
swarmed me with their powdery wings,
I asked why. 
I asked how. 
I asked if
I could survive knowing
that not everything has a reason, 
that not everything is capable
of or interested in reason.
Nothing answered. 
Nothing spoke
my language of smoke."
Grace Among the Ferns,"The ferns—sharp lime green, lean over 
the concrete like a woman over a boardwalk 
on a bright spring day like this, though maybe it is better 
with Grace’s curious nose assessing the damp earth
while ignoring its copious lizards. 
There is joy in the soft butt
of a dog disappearing into its daily necessities.
I am not sure I have ever had such a joy, 
either in discovery or expectation. Looking out
over the side of a boat
with a hat as wide as this fern 
is Grace, of the delicate paws.
I have never liked it: The Spring. But this is the 
end of Spring! First yellow of summer. They say a poet 
can never write a purely happy poem about a dog 
greeting the sun and what it has done to rain.
I don’t know about that. 
I am light like a canine’s memory; 
a minute, a world. Where one of the greatest 
and most daring feats is to enjoy 
the breeze’s slow boat of fertilization
made by other dogs of other years—the scent of
living in and of itself. Grace among the ferns
likes to place her body right over the pulpit 
of the last dog, so they know. I am here, too. Living.
Lime green ribbons touch her soft, wet nose."
Looking for the Beautiful Things,"I live in Texas now. & in the next lane over on I-10
BIG JEFF is soaring at twin-speed toward the dusk-pending horizon 
& something base & graceful has taken us over
like, if I took my hands off the wheel, we could lift into the air & become 
part of the indistinguishable wave of laughing gulls above. 
BIG JEFF says his license plate, which I first checked when I let him pass 
10 miles back because his lights behind me
were the Second Coming (or the First Coming, in his case, if we’re making 
the usual jokes about men with big trucks). 
But I don’t want to make unbecoming jokes about BIG JEFF, who is 
right now, accompanying me down this interstate 
of solitude, not leaving me behind or riding my bumper, just gliding 
beside me as if he needs someone too, as if he trusts me 
& said to himself in his blue-lit interior, Hey, I’m gonna hang on her wing.
She seems to know how to get where we’re going.
She’s probably a hellcat. No balls hanging from his tow bar, just BIG JEFF 
on his pearlescent Ford Super Duty, which has a row of three 
headlights on each side & which, I admit, I was more than annoyed by 
when he came up behind me like an astrodome 
on wheels. But Texas is home now & this is the way of things—BIG JEFF 
& NASA, tacos & trucks. The only state with more guns 
than Kentucky, the expert at the range told me before I left. I am an expert 
at beginnings, a Lone Star once again, as I have been 
in every state I’ve lived—the Bluegrass, the Garden, the Palmetto, the Bay—
each time hoping I’m closer to the beautiful things."
"Logically, I Know the Circus","exists to keep audiences
unsatisfied with
their mundane homelives, yet here
I am pacing my bedroom
and having serious
thoughts about trapeze
artistry—greasy
eyeliner, powdered
hands—and can you even
apply to be in a traveling act,
or do you need to be
discovered? I don’t want to be
famous, just remembered.
In high school I was
voted most likely to
ignore the demands
of men and gravity,
but it’s a difficult feat
when the two work together.
Like here, or
like in the flying trapeze:
man secures his hold,
gravity improves the swing."
[Has Spring passed away?],"Translated by Yone Noguchi
Has Spring passed away?
Did Summer already come?
Lo, Kagu Yama! There 
The white gowns are seen being dried."
warm water,"The narrative that I do not belong in the spindle of my spine,
in a biorhythm part NaeNae and Wop, as a translation generations
removed from meaning—these are my crying thirties.
Where I’m caught, between past and ASAP, you are the representative
of all who could not risk an act of love. Waking the dream is hard.
Hard to object you. Hard to know there is no more than what, here, is.
I’m fatigued by the going. People say, “You are young, you don’t crack.”
And they laugh a murder. I read them, they read me, they stare. I cry
privately. My sorrow means they’ve found amending.
We are in clouds, on ice and horses and smoking our way
to the morning’s edge. We sip life neat. Medicate so not to feel the root.
I go there, too, to sulk, to touch again what you deny. Key “Coward”
on the driver’s side, “Cunt” for anyone who takes passage with you.
For the consequences of my desire, I cry. For those times in my youth
when I was free and unaware and could turn a woman into a monsoon.
Could strip my skin, step inside out, leave my bones for looking.
We give up so much not to be seen. In all these “nevers” and “I won’t,”
I made a home in places where I didn’t. There is no one familiar here.
Not you to love me, not a one.
Make a body out of my sobs and the greenest grass grows.
In the cemetery, the tombs were petrified by their loneliness.
Bring me deep blues, bring me to my violets.
I bring up femurs and think in triangles, and I’m holy. I am canyon
and echo of curious voices, aren’t you moved? Their chatter, cherry
blossoms and hail; their longing, cicadas.
Hoping it will come back to welcome, I drag our placenta behind me.
Together can be restored with a blink. My thread, where are you?
I have no more needles to spare.
I am at your doorstep. Each tear opens us up to our promise—
bring the wake of your hand to my cheek. What I need today is
your sunshine that pulls me from earth."
Will know nothing,"Deep inside the quiet deep parting of private seas
to leagues of muscular chants, there is a love
to be lost and broken    rearranged like blocks—
whose name we spell is not the issue—it is us not willing
to pay attention to architecture, its integrity, whether
it will last the shake    we go story after story
thinking the roof will know nothing of the ground."
The Vault,"Little wave
in thought. 
Blank architecture 
that holds me. 
This is a little psalm 
in the moon-
struck snow. 
Thank you,
for I haven’t been 
patient as promised. 
Thank you,
for the desperate
Hopper-esque light. 
There is so little
to hold, I said
as I held it. Each 
bloom 
of strength 
that entered
my hands."
The Waiting,"I was waiting for something
to arrive. I didn’t know what.
Something buoyed, something
sun knocked. I placed my palms
up, little pads of butter, expecting.
All day, nothing. Longer than
that. My hair grew, fell out,
grew. Outside my window, I felt
the flick of a tail in September
wind. A bobcat sauntered across
the grass before me, the black tip
of its tail a pencil I’d like to sharpen.
I immediately hushed, crouched,
became a crumpled shock of
joy to see something this wild,
not myself. It turned to look
at me, its body muscular in
the turning. In its mouth was
the tail of a mouse drained of
blood, dangling diorama of death.
Sharp eyes looking at me and then,
not. Its lack of fear, its slow stroll
across the stream’s bridge, fur
lacquering its teeth. Sometimes
what comes to us, we never called
for. How long had I been crouched
like that? I stood up, blood rush
trumpeting. My arms wrapped
themselves around myself, lifted.
It was as if a bank vault had
opened and I was just standing
there, stealing nothing."
How Near to Fairyland,"The spring warmth steals into me, drying up all the tears of my soul,
And gives me a flight into the vastness,—into a floorless, unroofed reverie-hall.
Lo, such greenness, such velvety greenness, such a heaven without heaven above!
Lo, again, such grayness, such velvety grayness, such an earth without earth below!
My soul sails through the waveless mirror-seas.
Oh, how near to Fairyland!
Blow, blow, gust of wind!
Sweep away my soul-boat against that very shore!"
It was easier to manage,"I started kindergarten that fall you went off to Guyana.
Granny cut off my dreadlocks. She knew how to press
and curl, ponytail, and cornrow but palm roll
locks till the roots stiffened with beeswax,
glistens like licorice, she didn’t know.
For that matter, no one in the Projects knew
what to do with hair left natural, left
unparted and wild—they were afraid to touch
that unmothered part of themselves. Each snip
made each one alive and each one dead.
And if you said goodbye, it was an honest whisper,
short and fine in your throat.
She cut my hair like a boy’s
who hadn’t been to the barber for a month,
and I sat at the cafeteria table alone for weeks.
They couldn’t make sense of me, my classmates
with their gender-proper hairstyles. I didn’t
want anything to do with franks & beans,
those pucks of grilled meat. I waited at lunchtime
for peanut butter and jelly and was hesitant to eat
bread that wasn’t our color. It was hard
not hearing your voice each morning,
throughout the day. And unwilling to correct them
when they said my name wrong, I gave into
the Sizzlean; the fried chicken crunched
between my teeth, I could’ve bitten both of your hands
for leaving me here, each finger for the gunshots that rang
the night, the footsteps running on the roof, the gravel mashed
deeper and deeper into my sleep. Flocks of butterflies
broke my skin and I was shatter where I stood,
a whole constellation of wondering if I could throw
myself to the sky, coat it with urgent wishes
you’d see that I missed you, that the barter was unfair,
that you mistook me for sheep."

I would not know you. This steady scrape
against paper to transport fecund lament, never.
If in your hands the pearl-handled gun
my stepfather kept in the broom closet—
I'd give you the aim I practiced at twelve.
“Home is where the heart is” marks an
average man’s forehead and the trashcan
is somewhere near his jewels.
If you brought me roses in high school,
wrapped in newspaper to protect me from thorns,
I would take them, and wash ink from my fingers
in the jeans and jersey flood of your girlboy body.
Let me be your girl.
4-evah 2 eternity onto my back.
Your finger's ballpoint end, again and again
practices the heart over i, and into the morning
we stash whispers where over thread, thread crosses.
I promise
I have impeccable aim.
Pulling a trigger loosens mustangs
in your veins. Piss into my mortar—an old war
recipe makes bullets complete. Let your shower
wash an asshole from the streets.
If blood quickly betrays its avenues
for Newark's sidewalks, his shirt tires of its thirst....
If his buddy drives him to the hospital
or leaves him to watch the night unspool—
what a Jacob's Ladder he makes...
If you're shocked your life requires this exchange,
come into my arms, Sakia. Come into my arms."
I Take Notes,"… on my iPhone as if it were a reporter’s notebook, efficient and cool.
Detached, my voice raises itself to inquire to questions I already know the answers to, skull-filed 
so many decades ago for future reference.
Reams of notes record incidents: calls to 911, a tossed chair, hunger strikes, “behavioral” issues 
they call them, I surmise when he can no longer tolerate
Mp>The cinderblock walls, the fenced-in windows, the odors of bleach and Pine Sol
and alcohol, the wails and wants of other residents looking for a way home.
This time I even suggest sedation, but before that, attention.
In this pandemic his thwarted life has shrunk to Lilliputian size—no socializing
in the  halls, no dance or music classes or current events discussions—no smoking
on the deck on cool nights.
Just this: a metal-framed cot-like bed with his poppy-printed gleeful sheets
he received for Christmas to remind him he is special after all.
Apart from the rest, for he gets company and kisses and snacks and cigars, jeans
and peanuts, Irish Spring soap and coconut shampoo.
He smells like a tropical breeze, is clean and fresh all day long.
He withdraws from the halls to the sounds of the Greek language as his blind fingers make love 
to Alexa and he mouths the words of a country he dreams of but will never see."
Almost Buried,"When my twin brother tells me stories about hanging out
With his cholo gangster friends from high school, part of me
Doesn’t want to hear it. It’s not that I’m afraid: I’m afraid to admit
That I’m afraid and I play along. He doesn’t tell me to show off,
That’s for sure. He’s not necessarily trying to scare me.
I think he’s just remembering his time with his friends;
The few that he had. They all came from broken homes.
Their parents were drug addicts. Lived in low-rent apartments,
Like us. None of his friends ever brought their drama 
To our home. Didn’t say bad words in front of my parents.
They were boys hiding behind baggy shirts and pants,
Because the world didn’t think much of them to ever
Give them a chance. I guess the reason I don’t like to hear 
His stories, even though it’s good for him to remember and release,
Is because I’m afraid to know he was ever so vulnerable;
Almost locked-up. Almost thrown away. Almost buried, forever."
from “Đổi Mới”,"Each of them described the brother's death in different terms, though the fact of his absence interrupted them indiscriminately. Do they know how he found his life, if from inside it looked like a cage shaped exactly like his body, except two sizes too big, growing as he grew, condensing when he made himself small, and no matter what he did, he couldn't dissolve its borders, not even while he slept. I don't think it let him sleep. At night, fighting sleep, I stay up as if hoping I'll catch wind of something. Tonight, or years ago, a wolf chased a deer past the cabin's front door and out onto lake ice where fate met each discriminately. Borders dissolved, but which one, between predator and prey, or stage and props? Anywhere there is a hole there are traces of arrival and departure. The wind becomes a palimpsest of the creature no longer here, and a song, or is it a cry, emerging from nowhere, on its way to nowhere, passes through until the textures of the earth absorb it entirely. Sound: a body's way of making itself known. Silence: a way of knowing."
Ballad,"Oh dream, why do you do me this way? 
Again, with the digging, again with the digging up.
Once more with the shovels.
Once more, the shovels full of dirt.
The vault lid. The prying. The damp boards.
Mother beside me.
Like she’s an old hat at this. 
Like all she’s got left is curiosity.
Like curiosity didn’t kill the red cat.
Such a sweet, gentle cat it was.
Here we go again, dream.
Mother, wearing her take-out-the-garbage coat.
I haven’t seen that coat in years.
The coat she wore to pick me up from school early.
She appeared at the back of the classroom, early.
Go with your mother, teacher said.
Diane, you are excused.
I was a little girl. Already a famous actress.
I looked at the other kids. I acted lucky.
Though everyone knows what an early pick-up means.
An early pick-up, dream.
What’s wrong, I asked my mother. It is early spring.
Bright sunlight. The usual birds. 
Air, teetering between bearable and unbearable.
Cold, but not cold enough to shiver.
Still, dream, I shiver. 
You know, my mother said. 
Her long garbage coat flying.
There was a wind, that day. 
A wind like a scurrying grandmother, dusting.
Look inside yourself, my mother said. 
You know why I have come for you.
And still I acted lucky. Lucky to be out.
Lucky to be out in the cold world with my mother.
I’m innocent, I wanted to say. 
A little white girl, trying out her innocence.
A white lamb, born into a cold field.
Frozen almost solid. Brought into the house. 
Warmed all night with hair dryers.
Death? I said. Smiling. Lucky.
We’re barely to the parking lot.
Barely to the car ride home.
But the classroom already feels like the distant past.
Long ago, my classmates pitying me.
Arriving at this car full of uncles.
Were they wearing suits? Death such a formal occasion.
My sister, angry-crying next to me.
Me, encountering a fragment of evil in myself.
Evilly wanting my mother to say it.
What? I asked, smiling. My lamb on full display at the fair.
He’s dead! my sister said. Hit me in the gut with her flute.
Her flute case. Her rental flute. He’s dead!
Our father.
Our father, who we were not supposed to know had been dying.
He’s dead! The flute gleaming in its red case.
Here, my mother said at home.
She’d poured us each a small glass of Pepsi
We normally couldn’t afford Pepsi.
Lucky, I acted.
He’s no longer suffering, my mother said.
Here, she said. Drink this.
The little bubbles flew. They bit my tongue.
My evil persisted. What is death? I asked.
And now, dream, once more you bring me my answer.
Dig, my mother says. Pry, she says.
I don’t want to see, dream.
The lid so damp it crumbles under my hands.
The casket just a drawerful of bones.
A drawerful. Just bones and teeth.
That one tooth he had. Crooked like mine."
Gitanjali 83,"Mother, I shall weave a chain of pearls for thy neck with my tears of sorrow.
       The stars have wrought their anklets of light to deck thy feet, but mine will hang upon thy breast.
       Wealth and fame come from thee and it is for thee to give or to withhold them. But this my sorrow is absolutely mine own, and when I bring it to thee as my offering thou rewardest me with thy grace."
Moving the Bones,"There are too many ancestors, so we are gathering their bones.
The poor ones, their graves broken by the roots of trees. The ones whose headstones have been weathered as blank as snow-drifts.
We have bought the wide plot. We have built the mausoleum. And now we fill it with the bones.
The ones killed in the monsoon floods. The one buried in her wedding dress. The one buried with his medals.
Because there will be a time when we cannot keep track of them, scattered in the cemetery like prodigals, we collect the bones.
The ones whose faces I can still recall. The ones who have been dead for a hundred years. We collect their bones. 
At each opened grave, we think about the body taking its shape as father, sister, cousin, uncle. We hunger for the story of each figure.
We hold the bones, though we know memory is mostly forgetting. Or memory is the sweeper who clears the sidewalk each morning. Or memory is the broom.
The mausoleum is marble, white as certain roses, and shaped like a house. There is room for everyone we will put there.
The rich ones, their gravestones glowing with gold paint. The infants with sweet names.  
We open their graves. We move their bones.
Look back far enough and your family becomes unfamiliar, a circle of people with a fading circumference.  
When I think of it long enough, home becomes a confusion of birthplace, hometown, country, and nation.
We walk through the cemetery, we point to our own, and we gather their bones.
Maybe memory is the desperate pharaoh who commands that the things of this life go with him into the next.
I would take with me the books I loved best. A jar of the ocean spanning my two countries. A slip of my lover’s sunny hair.  
I would take with me a sack of rice. My mother’s orange shawl. The robe my father wears in the kitchen at night, drinking a glass of water.  
That we might go to just one place to worship them, to wonder at who they were, we are moving the bones.  
Our tribe of eros and vinegar. Our black hair, our ordinary minds.
Holding the bones, we say the names of the dead, the music of the syllables, conjuring the hearts they answered to.  We hold the bones. 
Each stern skull. Each proud sternum. Each elegant rib, curved like a horizon."
Our Land,"We should have a land of sun, 
Of gorgeous sun, 
And a land of fragrant water
Where the twilight is a soft bandanna handkerchief
Of rose and gold, 
And not this land
Where life is cold.

We should have a land of trees,
Of tall thick trees,
Bowed down with chattering parrots
Brilliant as the day,
And not this land where birds are gray.

Ah, we should have a land of joy, 
Of love and joy and wine and song, 
And not this land where joy is wrong."

Medicine Dance 
                        A body smiling with black beauty 
                        Leaping into the air 
                        Around a grotesque hyena-faced monster: 
                        The sorcerer—
                        A black body—dancing with beauty 
                        Clothed in African moonlight, 
                        Smiling more beauty into its body. 
                        The hyena-faced monster yelps! 
                        Echo! 
                        Silence—
                        The dance 
                        Leaps—
                        Twirls—
                        The twirling body comes to a fall
                        At the feet of the monster. 
                        Yelps—
                        Wild—
                        Terror-filled—
                        Echo—
                        The hyena-faced monster jumps 
                        starts, 
                        runs, 
                        chases his own yelps back to the wilderness. 
                        The black body clothed in moonlight 
                        Raises up its head, 
                        Holding a face dancing with delight. 
                        Terror reigns like a new crowned king. "
Parable of the Unclean Spirit,"You can’t remember what they did to you. Your loneliness isn’t welcome here, you know, but still you walk the dream-lit village, looking for someone gentle enough. There must be an animal trapped under your shirt, you think, because little claws scratch against your chest and you throb there, but you're afraid to look because looking means remembering. You ask a man passing on the road to lift your shirt and check and he retches at what he sees, says the flesh there overflows, as if grinding its own meat, that strips of skin curl away from the wound like rot mushrooms growing on a tree, and he can't help you, you make him sick, he says, he has to go now, so you wander some more until you reach the gate, which is the end of who you could have been, the end of the dream of your body made full with starmilk, propelled by a heart of sea anemone. You’ll be hungry forever if you stay here, trying to hide your secret mouth from all this light. Before you can cross the gate into that dark valley, you must look at yourself. You can think of other words for red: crimson, cherry, scarlet. But there's no other name for blood, no name for a shame like this, its hiss of pain when you press your finger to it, the sweet stain it leaves on your fingertip. You just have to taste it."

She Manifests Her Own Ineffable,"Other than the intricacies of the creak sky blackness that opens
against the horizon A horizon not imagined as any way to anything
Crouch in some ways recessing against a train of No a well of
intentions and cliché A well with a surface that you understand to be
water but reflects not me but you not her or him or him but you You
with your eyebrows crooked like night bending through a stairwell

Nothing not there or there either Here"
American Sonnet for Wanda C.,"Who I know knows why all those lush-boned worn-out girls are
Whooping at where the moon should be, an eyelid clamped
On its lightness. Nobody sees her without the hoops firing in her
Ears because nobody sees. Tattooed across her chest she claims
Is BRING ME TO WHERE MY BLOOD RUNS and I want that to be here
Where I am her son, pent in blackness and turning the night's calm
Loose and letting the same blood fire through me. In her bomb hair:
Shells full of thunder; in her mouth: the fingers of some calamity,
Somebody foolish enough to love her foolishly. Those who could hear
No music weren't listening—and when I say it, it's like claiming
She's an elegy. It rhymes, because of her, with effigy. Because of her,
If there is no smoke, there is no party. I think of you, Miss Calamity,
Every Sunday. I think of you on Monday. I think of you hurling hurt
Where the moon should be and stomping into our darkness calmly."
American Sonnet (95),"seized by wicked enchantment, i surrendered my song
as i fled for the stars, i saw an earthchild
in a distant hallway, crying out
to his mother, “please don’t go away
and leave us.” he was, i saw, my son. immediately,
i discontinued my flight
from here, i see the clocktower in a sweep of light,
framed by wild ivy. it pierces all nights to come
I haunt these chambers but they belong to cruel churchified insects.
among the books mine go unread, dust-covered.
i write about urban bleeders and breeders, but am
troubled because their tragedies echo mine.
at this moment I am sickened by the urge
to smash. my thighs present themselves
stillborn, misshapen wings within me"
Fall Term (V),"I promised my wife that I would call Dr. Song today. After putting Mira down for her nap and slipping outside for a smoke, I lifted the receiver. The sound it emitted, which I have heard without pause countless times before, seemed to me otherworldly now, like somebody’s finger playing on the wet rim of a crystal bowl in a derelict theater before the wars.
It’s hard to say how long I stood there listening. It may have been seconds or seasons. The rings of Saturn kept turning in their groove. For reasons beyond me—our seminar had already moved on from late medieval Europe to developing world underworlds—I dialed 1-800-INFERNO, and before the first ring, a woman’s voice answered in heavily accented English.
“Is it you?”
“I think so,” I replied. Outside, the honey locusts sprinkled their pale spinning leaves in real time. Focusing on one as it fell seemed to slow the general descent.
“Oh creature, gracious and good,” the faraway lady recited, as if reading, against her will, from a prepared text, “traversing the dusky element to visit us / who stained the world with blood.” I could hear rain trickling in a gutter spout on the other end of the line.
“Please,” I said into the receiver, “remove my name from your list.”"
Terrorem,"Every night, I go back to Mr. Jefferson’s place, searching still
his kitchens, behind staircases, in a patch of shade somewhere
beside his joinery & within his small ice house, till I get down
that pit, lined with straw, where Mr. Jefferson once stacked frozen slabs
of river water until summer. Then, visitors would come to him
to ask about a peculiar green star, or help him open up
his maps. They’d kneel together on the floor, among his books
lavish hunks of ice melting like the preserved tears
of some antique mammal who must have wept
to leave Ablemarle, just as I wept when I landed in Milan
for the first time, stone city where Mr. Jefferson began
to learn the science of ice houses, how you dig into the dark
flank of the land, how you seal the cavity. Leave open
just one small hatch through which I might lift, through gratings
Mr. Jefferson’s cold dressed victuals, his expensive butter & salads
the sealed jars sweating clear gems of condensation, white blood
appearing from warm air, as if air could break & slough, revealing
the curved arc of our shared Milan. There, I wore silver rings
on each thumb. I studied & spoke in fine houses 
of ice. I knew a kind of crying which sealed me to such realms
for good. Old magic weep, old throb-in-throat. How much
of my fondness for any place is water, stilled & bound
to darkness?"

It’s Important I Remember that the Moral Arc of the Universe Bends—,"but it doesn't break, and neither breaks toward justice
nor away from it. It simply bends, as the bow does
before propelling the arrow where it may, agnostic
to everything but flight. I don't mean to make morality
a weapon in this way, but it already is one and has been
for some time. The shackles, after all, were explained
as saving us from ourselves, our naked savagery,
though it was their whip that licked us and left a kind
of tactile text on our bodies. The Bible will have a man
beating on someone as easily as it will have another
taking one, turning the other cheek, civilly disobedient
even when the bombs blow up in their church, not to say
saying no to violence isn't commendable, just to say
a strong case can be made for cracking a skull or two
like an everyday egg in hopes whatever golden light
resides inside shines through, throughs the crimson tide
for the rest of time so the tide will, mercifully, recede."
Self-Portrait at 28,"I know it’s a bad title
but I’m giving it to myself as a gift
on a day nearly canceled by sunlight
when the entire hill is approaching
the ideal of Virginia
brochured with goldenrod and loblolly
and I think “at least I have not woken up
with a bloody knife in my hand”
by then having absently wandered
one hundred yards from the house
while still seated in this chair
with my eyes closed.
It is a certain hill.
The one I imagine when I hear the word “hill,”
and if the apocalypse turns out
to be a world-wide nervous breakdown,
if our five billion minds collapse at once,
well I’d call that a surprise ending
and this hill would still be beautiful,
a place I wouldn’t mind dying
alone or with you.
I am trying to get at something
and I want to talk very plainly to you
so that we are both comforted by the honesty.
You see, there is a window by my desk
I stare out when I’m stuck,
though the outdoors has rarely inspired me to write
and I don’t know why I keep staring at it.
My childhood hasn’t made good material either,
mostly being a mulch of white minutes
with a few stand out moments:
popping tar bubbles on the driveway in the summer,
a certain amount of pride at school
everytime they called it “our sun,”
and playing football when the only play
was “go out long” are what stand out now.
If squeezed for more information
I can remember old clock radios
with flipping metal numbers
and an entree called Surf and Turf.
As a way of getting in touch with my origins,
every night I set the alarm clock
for the time I was born, so that waking up
becomes a historical reenactment
and the first thing I do
is take a reading of the day
and try to flow with it,
like when you’re riding a mechanical bull
and you strain to learn the pattern quickly
so you don’t inadvertently resist it.
  II.
I can’t remember being born
and no one else can remember it either
even the doctor who I met years later
at a cocktail party.
It’s one of the little disappointments
that makes you think about getting away,
going to Holly Springs or Coral Gables
and taking a room on the square
with a landlady whose hands are scored
by disinfectant, telling the people you meet
that you are from Alaska, and listen
to what they have to say about Alaska
until you have learned much more about Alaska
than you ever will about Holly Springs or Coral Gables.
Sometimes I’m buying a newspaper
in a strange city and think
“I am about to learn what it’s like to live here.”
Oftentimes there’s a news item
about the complaints of homeowners
who live beside the airport
and I realize that I read an article
on this subject nearly once a year
and always receive the same image:
I am in bed late at night
in my house near the airport
listening to the jets fly overhead,
a strange wife sleeping beside me.
In my mind the bedroom is an amalgamation
of various cold medicine commercial sets
(there is always a box of tissue on the nightstand).
I know these recurring news articles are clues,
flaws in the design, though I haven’t figured out
how to string them together yet.
But I’m noticing that the same people
are dying over and over again,
for instance, Minnie Pearl
who died this year
for the fourth time in four years.
  III.
Today is the first day of Lent
and once again I’m not really sure what it is.
How many more years will I let pass
before I take the trouble to ask someone?
It reminds me of this morning
when you were getting ready for work.
I was sitting by the space heater,
numbly watching you dress,
and when you asked why I never wear a robe
I had so many good reasons
I didn’t know where to begin.
If you were cool in high school
you didn’t ask too many questions.
You could tell who’d been to last night’s
big metal concert by the new t-shirts in the hallways.
You didn’t have to ask
and that’s what cool was:
the ability to deduce,
to know without asking.
And the pressure to simulate coolness
means not asking when you don’t know,
which is why kids grow ever more stupid.
A yearbook’s endpages, filled with promises
to stay in touch, stand as proof of the uselessness
of a teenager’s promise. Not like I’m dying
for a letter from the class stoner
ten years on but…
Do you remember the way the girls
would call out “love you!”
conveniently leaving out the “I”
as if they didn’t want to commit
to their own declaration.
I agree that the “I” is a pretty heavy concept
and hope you won’t get uncomfortable
if I should go into some deeper stuff here.
  IV.
There are things I’ve given up on
like recording funny answering-machine messages.
It’s part of growing older
and the human race as a group
has matured along the same lines.
It seems our comedy dates the quickest.
If you laugh out loud at Shakespeare’s jokes
I hope you won’t be insulted
if I say you’re trying too hard.
Even sketches from the original Saturday Night Live
seem slow-witted and obvious now.
It’s just that our advances are irrepressible.
Nowadays little kids can’t even set up lemonade stands.
It makes people too self-conscious about the past,
though try explaining that to a kid.
I’m not saying it should be this way.
All this new technology
will eventually give us new feelings
that will never completely displace the old ones,
leaving everyone feeling quite nervous
and split in two.
We will travel to Mars
even as folks on Earth
are still ripping open potato chip
bags with their teeth.
Why? I don’t have the time or intelligence
to make all the connections,
like my friend Gordon
(this is a true story)
who, having grown up in Braintree, Massachusetts,
had never pictured a brain snagged in a tree
until I brought it up.
He’d never broken the name down to its parts.
By then it was too late.
He had moved to Coral Gables.
  V.
The hill out my window is still looking beautiful,
suffused in a kind of gold national park light,
and it seems to say,
I’m sorry the world could not possibly
use another poem about Orpheus
but I’m available if you’re not working
on a self-portrait or anything.
I’m watching my dog have nightmares,
twitching and whining on the office floor,
and I try to imagine what beast
has cornered him in the meadow
where his dreams are set.
I’m just letting the day be what it is:
a place for a large number of things
to gather and interact —
not even a place but an occasion,
a reality for real things.
Friends warned me not to get too psychedelic
or religious with this piece:
“they won’t accept it if it’s too psychedelic
or religious,” but these are valid topics
and I’m the one with the dog twitching on the floor,
possibly dreaming of me,
that part of me that would beat a dog
for no good reason,
no reason that a dog could see.
I am trying to get at something so simple
that I have to talk plainly
so the words don’t disfigure it,
and if it turns out that what I say is untrue,
then at least let it be harmless
like a leaky boat in the reeds
that is bothering no one.
  VI.
I can’t trust the accuracy of my own memories,
many of them having blended with sentimental
telephone and margarine commercials,
plainly ruined by Madison Avenue,
though no one seems to call the advertising world
“Madison Avenue” anymore. Have they moved?
I need an update on this.
But first I have some business to take care of.
I walked out to the hill behind our house
which looks positively Alaskan today,
and it would be easier to explain this
if I had a picture to show you,
but I was with our young dog
and he was running through the tall grass
like running through the tall grass
is all of life together,
until a bird calls or he finds a beer can
and that thing fills all the space in his head.
You see,
his mind can only hold one thought at a time
and when he finally hears me call his name
he looks up and cocks his head.
For a single moment
my voice is everything:
Self-portrait at 28."
The Moon,"A web of sewer, pipe, and wire connects each house to the others.
In 206 a dog sleeps by the stove where a small gas leak causes him
to have visions; visions that are rooted in nothing but gas.
Next door, a man who has decided to buy a car part by part
excitedly unpacks a wheel and an ashtray.
He arranges them every which way. It’s really beginning to take
shape.
Out the garage window he sees a group of ugly children
enter the forest. Their mouths look like coin slots.
  A neighbor plays keyboards in a local cover band.
Preparing for an engagement at the high school prom,
they pack their equipment in silence.
Last night they played the Police Academy Ball and all
the officers slow-danced with target range silhouettes.
  This year the theme for the prom is the Tetragrammaton.
A yellow Corsair sails through the disco parking lot
and swaying palms presage the lot of young libertines.
Inside the car a young lady wears a corsage of bullet-sized rodents.
Her date, the handsome cornerback, stretches his talons over the
molded steering wheel.
They park and walk into the lush starlit gardens behind the disco
just as the band is striking up.
Their keen eyes and ears twitch. The other couples
look beautiful tonight. They stroll around listening
to the brilliant conversation. The passionate speeches.
Clouds drift across the silverware. There is red larkspur,
blue gum, and ivy. A boy kneels before his date.
And the moon, I forgot to mention the moon."
The Charm of 5:30,"It’s too nice a day to read a novel set in England.
We’re within inches of the perfect distance from the sun,
the sky is blueberries and cream,
and the wind is as warm as air from a tire.
Even the headstones in the graveyard
           seem to stand up and say “Hello! My name is...”
It’s enough to be sitting here on my porch,
thinking about Kermit Roosevelt,
following the course of an ant,
or walking out into the yard with a cordless phone
           to find out she is going to be there tonight.
On a day like today, what looks like bad news in the distance
turns out to be something on my contact, carports and
white courtesy phones are spontaneously reappreciated
           and random “okay”s ring through the backyards.
This morning I discovered the red tints in cola
                     when I held a glass of it up to the light
and found an expensive flashlight in the pocket of a winter coat
                     I was packing away for summer.
It all reminds me of that moment when you take off your
sunglasses after a long drive and realize it’s earlier
and lighter out than you had accounted for.
You know what I’m talking about,
and that’s the kind of fellowship that’s taking place in town, out in
the public spaces. You won’t overhear anyone using the words
“dramaturgy” or “state inspection” today. We’re too busy getting along.
It occurs to me that the laws are in the regions and the regions are
in the laws, and it feels good to say this, something that I’m almost
sure is true, outside under the sun.
Then to say it again, around friends, in the resonant voice of a
nineteenth-century senator, just for a lark.
There’s a shy looking fellow on the courthouse steps, holding up
a placard that says “But, I kinda liked Clinton.” His head turns slowly
as a beautiful girl walks by, holding a refrigerated bottle up against
her flushed cheek.
She smiles at me and I allow myself to imagine her walking into
town to buy lotion at a brick pharmacy.
When she gets home she’ll apply it with great lingering care
before moving into her parlor to play 78 records and drink gin-and-tonics
beside her homemade altar to James Madison.
In a town of this size, it’s certainly possible that I’ll be invited over
one night.
In fact I’ll bet you something.
Somewhere in the future I am remembering today. I’ll bet you
I’m remembering how I walked into the park at five thirty,
my favorite time of day, and how I found two cold pitchers
of just poured beer, sitting there on the bench.
I am remembering how my friend Chip showed up
with a catcher’s mask hanging from his belt and how I said
great to see you, sit down, have a beer, how are you,
and how he turned to me with the sunset reflecting off his
contacts and said, wonderful, how are you."
Classic Water,"I remember Kitty saying we shared a deep longing for
the consolation prize, laughing as we rinsed the stagecoach.
I remember the night we camped out
           and I heard her whisper
“think of me as a place” from her sleeping bag
           with the centaur print.
I remember being in her father’s basement workshop
when we picked up an unknown man sobbing
over the shortwave radio
and the night we got so high we convinced ourselves
that the road was a hologram projected by the headlight beams.
I remember how she would always get everyone to vote
on what we should do next and the time she said
“all water is classic water” and shyly turned her face away.
At volleyball games her parents sat in the bleachers
like ambassadors from Indiana in all their midwestern schmaltz.
She was destroyed when they were busted for operating
a private judicial system within U.S. borders.
  Sometimes I’m awakened in the middle of the night
by the clatter of a room service cart and I think back on Kitty.
Those summer evenings by the government lake,
talking about the paradox of multiple Santas
or how it felt to have your heart broken.
I still get a hollow feeling on Labor Day when the summer ends
and I remember how I would always refer to her boyfriends
as what’s-his-face, which was wrong of me and I’d like
to apologize to those guys right now, wherever they are:
No one deserves to be called what’s-his-face."
The New Brain,"Consciousness travels, my sweet: don’t you remember?
One sends one’s thoughts to thee as on this footfall,
or in this poem. But, truly, remember how we left our old meat-
heads to enter the glyph and ride the crystal ark, un-
bodied but worded. My mother is a starred thought—
and, Don’t You Remember? the Mind from nowhere is everywhere,
not just under your skin. The first mind, not evolved but absolute
rainbow with me, you and me. Nothing depends on it either.
Someday I will remember this very future I am in, image in space.
I will at least see her, I say to myself, she will be someone
else than one ever thought and her eyes will be blue words on white.
Consciousness travels from Neptune the planet to Neptune the god of the sea.
I travel to your irony and perambulation, your decibels and vehement
budget: I perceive you for you. You don’t have time. I
have time, I am the goddess of the smooth doorway. Let me in,
so I can abolish your description."
In the Grove: The Poet at Ten,"She lay on her back in the timothy
and gazed past the doddering
auburn heads of sumac.
A cloud—huge, calm,
and dignified—covered the sun
but did not, could not, put it out.
The light surged back again.
Nothing could rouse her then
from that joy so violent
it was hard to distinguish from pain."
Reflections in a Pool of Hair,"You have been standing in a pool of your own hair.
You rub the hair into dirt and pick out crows 
       you’d like to lift it away.
You take off your socks.
Hand to eyes to block the sun, you look
       for someone who looks like you.
You see men in retro glasses, you see men behind 
       retrofitted glass and men
on black bikes and women with small
piercings in their sharp noses and you see their bad silver 
       nail polish, you’ve got
bad silver nail polish
and everyone wheezes. You wheeze
and the small gay men at the bar spend sunset
tuning American Idol onto two screens.
       They talk like bar glass. In their gravel, they vote singers.
There is a tingle at the back of your throat that holds 
       the phone on hold and thinks the words
                           Obama.
Obama wants to be a palindrome.
You catch yourself in a plate glass window, you catch yourself
      in the neighbor’s glass plate, you catch yourself
wondering if you look like your hair
in their windows. They put away things
as soon as you ask about them."
Still Life with Hemorrhage,"A wine crate for a nightstand, and on it, a rose
gone bad in a cup. Its water
a swallow of shadow, murk of rot
and sugar. Clothes sloughed, bodiless, and half-
eaten on a plate,
a plum in its juice. At the center
of the scene: a woman on a mattress
on the floor. Her arms cast out
as if preparing to fly
or as if pinned, savior
or specimen. Still asleep.
Day breaking through the window
a warm leak.
The woman in its spotlight
like a halo. As if something holy,
or at least chosen."
Fire-Flowers,"And only where the forest fires have sped, 
  Scorching relentlessly the cool north lands,
A sweet wild flower lifts its purple head, 
And, like some gentle spirit sorrow-fed,
  It hides the scars with almost human hands.
And only to the heart that knows of grief,
  Of desolating fire, of human pain,
There comes some purifying sweet belief, 
Some fellow-feeling beautiful, if brief.
  And life revives, and blossoms once again."
For a Lovely Lady,"A creature slender as a reed,
    And sad-eyed as a doe
Lies here (but take my word for it,
    And do not pry below)."
For a Lady I Know,"She even thinks that up in heaven
    Her class lies late and snores,
While poor black cherubs rise at seven
    To do celestial chores."
For a Virgin,"For forty years I shunned the lust
    Inherent in my clay;
Death only was so amorous
    I let him have his way."
For a Singer,"Death clogged this flute
    At its highest note;
Song sleeps here mute
    In this breathless throat."
Cassette County,"This is meant to be in praise of the interval called hangover,
a sadness not co-terminous with hopelessness,
and the North American doubling cascade
that (keep going) “this diamond lake is a photo lab”
and if predicates really do propel the plot
then you might see Jerusalem in a soap bubble
or the appliance failures on Olive Street
across these great instances,
because “the complex Italians versus the basic Italians”
because what does a mirror look like (when it’s not working)
but birds singing a full tone higher in the sunshine.
I’m going to call them Honest Eyes until I know if they are,
in the interval called slam-clicker, Realm of Pacific,
because the second language wouldn’t let me learn it
because I have heard of you for a long time occasionally
because diet cards may be the recovery evergreen
and there is a new benzodiazepene called Distance,
anti-showmanship, anti-showmanship, anti-showmanship.
I suppose a broken window is not symbolic
unless symbolic means broken, which I think it sorta does,
and when the phone jangles
what’s more radical, the snow or the tires,
and what does the Bible say about metal fatigue
and why do mothers carry big scratched-up sunglasses
in their purses.
Hello to the era of going to the store to buy more ice
because we are running out.
Hello to feelings that arrive unintroduced.
Hello to the nonfunctional sprig of parsley
and the game of finding meaning in coincidence.
Because there is a second mind in the margins of the used book
because Judas Priest (source: Firestone Library)
sang a song called Stained Class,
because this world is 66% Then and 33% Now,
and if you wake up thinking “feeling is a skill now”
or “even this glass of water seems complicated now”
and a phrase from a men’s magazine (like single-district cognac)
rings and rings in your neck,
then let the consequent misunderstandings
(let the changer love the changed)
wobble on heartbreakingly nu legs
into this street-legal nonfiction,
into this good world,
this warm place
that I love with all my heart,
anti-showmanship, anti-showmanship, anti-showmanship."
I Never Knew I Loved Dean Rader,"after Hikmet/O’Hara/Reeves/Vuong
Someday, I’ll love Dean Rader
                                                          the way the blue jay
loves the sparrow egg,
or perhaps the way the waves love the curve they give
themselves to when giving is no longer an option
like falling or dreaming
                                           or even being on this earth,
in this body.
                          Someday I’ll love my body, itself a form of silence,
which is not the same as being quiet, 
even though we are sentenced to this language with its strange letters,
their shapes like bowls, small sticks, the bellies of pregnant women, 
as though everything spelled 
                                                      must also be birthed and broken,
cracked open and spilled, 
                                                filled with the absence of what won’t do,
like waiting for the earth to tap out your name.
                                                                            I never knew I loved my name, 
can someone who has never believed his name love it? 
Once on a train to Serbia a soldier woke me from a dream I still remember
and pointed a gun at my right shoulder. 
                                                                                              I never knew 
I loved my shoulder until I placed my son’s head there 
our first night home from the hospital, 
                                                                      his chest lifting like an umbrella
in a storm. I don’t like comparing my son to an umbrella,
though he has known what it is to be folded, 
                                                                                to be wet and cold.
Someday I will love the cold,
                                                     not just as metaphor but as a means to clarity,
which is what I need this November night, 
the moon swinging in its black noose over the city,
the entire world hooded, 
                                             blindfolded perhaps,
lined up against a wall and waiting,
                                                                       the way a reader waits,
for a poem to get where it’s going. 
Someday I will love the poem, 
                                                         the way I will love being afraid,
but this is not what I want to say.
It is something more like this: 
                                                       the future is not what it used to be,
and even that is only part of it.
The other part has something to do with speculation, 
like what awaits us when we remove the hood. 
                                                                           I never knew I loved blindness. 
The punishment for sight is always forgiveness.
Someday I will love forgiveness, 
                                            but it is difficult to love what has not been earned.
My grandfather when he was tenderest would call me Dean Dean,
and I felt like a child 
                          in the body of a boy who believed he had the ideas of a man.
Every morning after breakfast he and my grandmother
would throw leftover toast into the backyard for the birds.
I just remembered the birds and the bread. 
                                                                                          I love them both. 
Someday I will love more things, 
                                                                   and I will not think of death,
and even if I do I will not feel saddened by the end
of the person who wears my name, 
                                                               even though it is always easy to mourn 
                            a stranger.

Gertrude: In the Rooms,"Sometimes I still think of Gertrude 
and all her privacies, of the tenuous
sheen of her thin gray hair,
and the sculptural, elegant way 
she piled it high up on her head. 
                                       Even now
typing these simple words, vividly
she returns, conjuring the images 
that made her real, transcending
the withered anonymities of elderly
citizens one passes in the street
without even noticing a whole life
is walking by…  
                           Gertrude’s 
agony seemed different from ours.
Older. Well-thumbed. Polite
And buckled to her person
Like a well-fitting garment. Ours?
Untamed, sharp-edged and shouting.
Hungry infant, railing in a crib. Not 
noiseless and ancient like hers.  
Nor glamorous as a hologram
Of anguish, flickering and glittering
with broken fragments of 
captured light which lit her up
inside her grief and made her
glow… 
              Surely she could not 
be as fragile as she looked,
carrying that weight. We craved
the object lesson of her tragedy 
thinking it would teach us how 
to transcend our sobbing, 
corporeal essences that grieved 
us so, and held us back as we 
kept on searching for the sure 
way out: the red door marked exit 
that Gertrude (we assumed) 
had passed through long before.
If you’re lucky, she once said
elliptically and apropos of nothing 
specific, It will bring you to your knees, 
speaking so softly we could barely 
even hear her, her legs crossed at the ankles
arranged off center, cotillion style 
of the debutante she once had been.  
Her vein-swollen, bony hand
gestured midpoint of her chest 
as if something still lodged there 
that had never broken free.
The rest of us felt shocked then—or I did
anyway—perceiving the torment 
still living inside her that we thought
she had conquered. The mystery was how
someone insignificant and ordinary
as Gertrude had redistributed 
that weight, and reoriented
the magnetic poles that for us
always defaulted to agony.  
She had been our hero,
icon of a victory that could
one day be ours if we learned
to live as Gertrude lived: elegant
and stoical, silencing our constant
clamoring for relief. But now 
here she was: testifying to victory 
or defeat? We could not tell, and that
Fucked us up. Oracular and  
Eternal was what we’d
thought she was. In possession 
of the answer. Instead,
her image and her words— 
It will bring you to your knees
turned us back into ourselves.
where the suffering was,
and the mystery, and offered 
no answer but the hard shock 
of our knees knocking against 
the earth, and the prickling burn 
of blood breaking its barrier of skin
and starting to flow."
In Memory of Colonel Charles Young,"Along the shore the tall, thin grass 
    That fringes that dark river, 
While sinuously soft feet pass, 
    Begins to bleed and quiver.
The great dark voice breaks with a sob
    Across the womb of night; 
Above your grave the tom-toms throb, 
    And the hills are weird with light. 
The great dark heart is like a well
    Drained bitter by the sky, 
And all the honeyed lies they tell 
    Come there to thirst and die. 
No lie is strong enough to kill
    The roots that work below; 
From your rich dust and slaughtered will
    A tree with tongues will grow. "
She of the Dancing Feet Sings,"And what would I do in heaven, pray, 
   Me with my dancing feet, 
And limbs like apple boughs that sway
   When the gusty rain winds beat? 
And how would I thrive in a perfect place
   Where dancing would be sin, 
With not a man to love my face, 
   Nor an arm to hold me in? 
The seraphs and the cherubim
   Would be too proud to bend 
To sing the feary tunes that brim
   My heart from end to end. 
The wistful angels down in hell
   Will smile to see my face,
And understand, because they fell
   From that all-perfect place. "
Baptism,"Into the furnace let me go alone;
Stay you without in terror of the heat. 
I will go naked in—for thus 'tis sweet—
Into the weird depths of the hottest zone. 
I will not quiver in the frailest bone, 
You will not note a flicker of defeat; 
My heart shall tremble not its fate to meet, 
Nor mouth give utterance to any moan.
The yawning oven spits forth fiery spears; 
Red aspish tongues shout wordlessly my name. 
Desire destroys, consumes my mortal fears, 
Transforming me into a shape of flame. 
I will come out, back to your world of tears, 
A stronger soul within a finer frame. "
For A Cynic,"Birth is a crime
All men commit;
Life gives them time
To atone for it;
Death ends the rhyme
As the price for it."
For My Grandmother,"This lovely flower fell to seed;
Work gently, sun and rain;
She held it as her dying creed
That she would grow again."
For A Poet,"I have wrapped my dreams in a silken
cloth,
And laid them away in a box of gold;
Where long will cling the lips of the moth,
I have wrapped my dreams in a silken cloth;
I hide no hate; I am not even wroth
Who found earth's breath so keen and cold;
I have wrapped my dreams in a silken cloth,
And laid them away in a box of gold."
Russian Cathedral,"Bow down my soul in worship very low
And in the holy silences be lost. 
Bow down before the marble man of woe, 
Bow down before the singing angel host. 
What jewelled glory fills my spirit's eye! 
What golden grandeur moves the depths of me! 
The soaring arches lift me up on high
Taking my breath with their rare symmetry. 
Bow down my soul and let the wondrous light
Of Beauty bathe thee from her lofty throne
Bow down before the wonder of man's might. 
Bow down in worship, humble and alone; 
Bow lowly down before the sacred sight 
Of man's divinity alive in stone. "
The Black Finger,"  I have just seen a most beautiful thing,
                     Slim and still,
              Against a gold, gold sky,
              A straight black cypress,
                     Sensitive,
                     Exquisite,
                     A black finger
                     Pointing upwards.
Why, beautiful still finger, are you black?
And why are you pointing upwards?"
"Lady, Lady","Lady, Lady, I saw your face, 
Dark as night withholding a star . . .
The chisel fell, or it might have been
You had borne so long the yoke of men. 
Lady, Lady, I saw your hands, 
Twisted, awry, like crumpled roots, 
Bleached poor white in a sudsy tub, 
Wrinkled and drawn from your rub-a-dub. 
Lady, Lady, I saw your heart, 
And altared there in its darksome place 
Were the tongues of flame the ancients knew, 
Where the good God sits to spangle through. "
Escape,"Shadows, shadows, 
Hug me round, 
So that I shall not be found
By sorrow: 
She pursues me
Everywhere, 
I can't lose her
Anywhere. 
Fold me in your black 
Abyss, 
She will never look
In this,—
Shadows, shadows, 
Hug me round 
In your solitude 
Profound. "
Vanishing,"Nearly one-third of the wild birds in the United States 
and Canada have vanished since 1970, a staggering 
loss that suggests the very fabric of North America’s 
ecosystem is unraveling.  
              –The New York Times (September 19, 2019)
As the world’s cities teem
with children—flooding 
our concrete terrains with shouts 
and signs—as the younglings balance 
scribbled Earths above their heads, 
stand in unseasonal rain 
or blistering sun,
the birds quietly lessen 
themselves among the grasslands. 
No longer a chorus but a lonely,
indicating trill: Eastern meadowlark,
wood thrush, indigo bunting—
their voices ghosts in the 
chemical landscape of crops.
Red-winged blackbirds veer
beyond the veil. Orioles 
and swallows, the horned lark
and the jay. Color drains from
our common home so gradually,
we convince ourselves 
it has always been gray.
Little hollow-boned dinosaurs,
you who survived the last extinction, 
whose variety has obsessed 
scientific minds, whose bodies 
in the air compel our own bodies
to spread and yearn—
how we have failed you.
The grackles are right to scold us, 
as they feast on our garbage 
and genetically-modified corn. 
Our children flock into the streets 
with voices raised, their anger 
a grim substitute
for song."
Boletus,"Crickets are stitching the afternoon
together. What the squalling catbird rends,
crickets relentlessly repair. The maple shivers,
sends yellowed messages sailing down.
Too much has ripped: half the main branch cracked off
and hangs, teetering, across lower boughs
leaving, on the trunk, a blond wound.
We cross the brook on stepping stones and climb
west up the mountain flank through laurel thickets,
along the scooped-out valley of beeches, up
the stream bed to sit on a fallen tree. But there’s
no rest. We carry with us what we left
below—a country clawing its very idea
to shreds. The scarlet boletus mushroom
prongs from decaying wood. In its bishop’s
amaranth skull cap, it stands its ground. One kind
will nourish; the other sickens. But not,
like the white amanita, bringing on
liver failure, seizures, death."
Origin Story,"“What is dying is the willingness to be in denial.”
            —angel Kyodo williams
The heron flew away 
and I wanted to tell someone   
how long it stayed,  
how close I got, 
how much I missed it
even as it stood
to watch me, 
large-eyed animal
that I am, terrible 
at believing what I can’t see.
You see fire in the home
where we live: the world
in cardiac arrest.
A heart attack
is not the onset I want to say
to someone, it’s the flare.
It illuminates what’s already here:
the forests
illuminated, the earth
lit as an origin story.
Here you are, 
I say instead, 
aloud, surprised
at how close 
I’ve been holding you
in the dark.
Flame yields 
no new landscape.
It bares the contours 
like a map
so we can see
where we’ve been all along, 
can see one another 
as we walk, and say,
for once, nothing
at the fire’s steady flight,
like a heron 
lifting in loud beats,
our silent mouths open   
as if to give it a tunnel."
When Nothing But Tree,"can be seen in the tree though the dogs
unmistakably indicate, when clearly 
the canopy calls to them and days
have passed before you’ve even begun,
when nothing in the undergrowth has
prompted so much as a whimper, you
must turn your thoughts to the other bank.
Scent from a living body will be carried
on the wind. Scent from a corpse in the
river spreads like oil. But say 
the return-to-elements has started just
beyond that rise. The body is cold, 
the scent like a river seeks lowest ground
becoming part of the river itself which the
trees in turn imbibe and, drawing upward,
change to living green. 
The one you seek is now an exhalation.
As the dogs, intelligent beyond our wildest
reckoning, have told us. Have
been telling us.

In Basel, on a panel made of limewood,
emphatically unrisen, 
the body of Christ lies in its frame as in
a coffin. Thwarted verticals. And strung
along a fault line where the pigment-
in-egg-yolk old way meets the pigment-
in-linseed new, the flesh
breathes beauty as only
that-which-is-liable-to-perish can breathe.
The green-going-black of face, of feet,
of visible hand confirm: no going back to
what you were. How is it
the linen on which he lies so clearly
discloses a pallet of stone (and hence
the catalog title—entombed) which means
the coffin I’ve imagined (warmer
framewood) must be pity’s crafted after-
thought. Or argument. The wholly
this-world begging to differ
with all we’ve been taught to hope for.

1521: the heretic from Wittenberg
refuses to recant though the question
has not yet turned to presence or real.
Sit down at my table (my body my 
blood) and I on your behalf will paint
a picture. Note the gaping nostril, gaping
mouth, the other mouth of the wound in his
side, the cradle of the abdomen. You see 
how disproportionate I’ve made his length,
the better to seal credulity. It’s fifteen 
hundred twenty one. “It is known,”
writes my informant, “that the artist used 
a body retrieved from the Rhine (citation
needed).” And either
the fish had not eaten the open eye or
Holbein in his studio restored it. Never
elsewhere, says the limewood, never
blind. Behold
the nearer case for mystery. I’m here to praise."
Let Me Begin Again,"Let me begin again as a quiet thought
in the shape of a shell slowly examined
by a brown child on a beach at dawn
straining to see their future. Let me begin
this time knowing the drumming in my dreams
is me inheriting the earth, is morning
lighting up the rivers. Let me burn
my vanities: old music in the pines, sifters
of scotch, a day moon like a signature
of night. This time, let me circle
the island of my fears only once then
live like a raging waterfall and grow
a magnificent mustache. Let me not ever be
the birdcage or the serrated blade or
the empty season. Dear Glacier, Dear Sea
of Stars, Dear Leopards disintegrating
at the outer limits of our greed; soon we will
encounter you only in motivational tweets.
Reader, I should have married you sooner.
This time, let me not sleep like the prophet who
believes he’s seen infinity. Let me run
at break-neck speeds toward sceneries
of doubt. I have no more dress rehearsals
to attend. Look closer: I am licking my lips."

Life goes by moving,
Up and down a chain of moods
Wanting what’s nothing.

Falling broken on the ground:
Pity the sky once.

Tears of gratitude.

Song that is no song …

Between the earth and the sun
On the moon’s shadow.

Treading wearily
A unit of the parade
There is no escape.

Of a spider web.

Moans at the breast of the earth
Being too full to sing.

Springing from eternity
Flow not recklessly.

I will wrap the song
In the leaves of the lotus
And send it to you.

Close yours out of love.

"And That Fast, You’re Thinking About Their Bodies","At a rooftop party, you dance near every edge. 
Someone drops a ring in glass, in your head 
the clink of a used bullet, still hot, and that fast 
the rooftop is covered with wires, riflemen, 
and you’re thinking about mutiny, MK-47s, 
two cities clawing at each other’s bruised 
throats while boys try to hold your hips, 
keep dancing. The war is on your hips. 
Your hands. You wear it all over. You wrap 
your hair in it. Pluck it from your eyebrows. 
The rooftop is wide and caring, too rained 
or sometimes incensed, and you never once 
think to be afraid of what could arrow a cloud 
and kill it. You eat volcano rolls, pink pepper 
goat cheese, and the war enters you. You stare 
at Still Life with Flowers and Fruit 
and the glade of roses scream 
war. Here with a doctor and your pregnant 
aunt who hasn’t yet learned English, only speaks 
in war. Friends in Greensboro get picked up 
by bored police, get beat up for no reason, 
and those fists carry war. At a job interview, 
you carve yourself into a white-known shape
and that renaming is a kind of war. 
You take a passport photo, told to smile 
without teeth, the flash a bright war. 
You’re on the other side of mercy
with your meadows and fluffed spillage,
where nights are creamed with saviors. 
Here everyone rests on roofs graduated 
and sung, gazing at a sky that won’t 
bleed them. At the beach, you’re buried 
to the neck, practicing dead, snug in your 
chosen tomb, gulls flittering on all sides, 
waves fleshing closer, and that fast you’re thinking 
of a grubby desert girl who placed small stones 
in her scarf, shook it back and forth,
said, This is what the sea must sound like. "
A Dream Of Foxes,"in the dream of foxes
there is a field
and a procession of women
clean as good children
no hollow in the world
surrounded by dogs
no fur clumped bloody
on the ground
only a lovely time
of honest women stepping
without fear or guilt or shame
safe through the generous fields."
One Year Later,"what if,
then,
entering my room,
brushing against the shadows,
lapping them into rust,
her soft paw extended,
she had called me out?
what if,
then,
i had reared up baying,
and followed her off
into vixen country?
what then of the moon,
the room, the bed, the poetry
of regret?"
My Father’s Accent,"A boy, prettier than me, who loved me because
my vocabulary and because my orange pills, once asked me
to translate my father’s English.
This poem wants me to translate it too.
Idiot poem, idiot hands for writing it
an accent isn’t sound.
Only those to whom it seems alien
would flatten an accent to sound.

My poem grew up here, sitting in this American chair
staring out at this lifeless American snow. 
Black grass dying up out of this snow,
through a rabbit’s
long tracks, like a ghost
sitting upright
saying oh.
But even that’s a lie.
Just black grass, blue snow.
I can’t write this
without trying to make it
beautiful. Submission, resistance, surrender.
On first
inspecting Adam, the devil entered his lips,
Watch: the devil enters Adam’s lips
crawls through his throat through his guts
to finally emerge out his anus.
He’s all hollow! the devil giggles.
He knows his job will be easy, a human just one long desperation
to be filled.
My father’s white undershirt peeking out
through his collar. My father’s hand slicing skin, gristle,
from a chicken carcass I hold still against the cutting board.
Sometimes he bites his bottom lip to suppress
what must be
rage. It must be rage
because it makes no sound. My vast
terror at what I can’t hear,
at my ignorance, is untranslatable.
My father speaks in perfect English."
Leaving Fox,"so many fuckless days and nights
only the solitary fox
watching my window light
barks her compassion.
i move away from her eyes.
from the pitying brush
of her tail
to a new place and check
for signs. so far
i am the only animal.
i will keep the door unlocked
until something human comes."
Dear Fox,"it is not my habit
to squat in the hungry desert
fingering stones, begging them
to heal, not me but the dry mornings
and bitter nights.
it is not your habit
to watch, none of this
is ours, sister fox.
tell yourself that anytime now
we will rise and walk away
from somebody else's life.
any time."
The Coming Of Fox,"one evening i return
to a red fox
haunched by my door.
i am afraid
although she knows
no enemy comes here.
next night again
then next then next
she sits in her safe shadow
silent as my skin bleeds
into long bright flags
of fur."
Fox,"who
can blame her for hunkering
into the doorwells at night,
the only blaze in the dark
the brush of her hopeful tail,
the only starlight
her little bared teeth?
and when she is not satisfied
who can blame her for refusing to leave,
Master Of The Hunt, why am i
not feeding, not being fed?"
I Want the Wide American Earth,"Before the brave, before the proud builders and workers,
I say I want the wide American earth,
Its beautiful rivers and long valleys and fertile plains,
Its numberless hamlets and expanding towns and towering cities,
Its limitless frontiers, its probing intelligence,
For all the free.
                         Free men everywhere in my land—
This wide American earth—do not wander homeless,
And are not alone; friendship is our bread, love our air;
And we call each other comrade, each growing with the other,
Each a neighbor to the other, boundless in freedom.
I say I want the wide American earth....
I say to you defenders of  freedom, builders of peace,
I say to you democratic brothers, comrades of love:
Their judges lynch us, their police hunt us;
Their armies and navies and airmen terrorize us;
Their thugs and stoolies and murderers kill us;
They take away bread from our children;
They ravage our women;
They deny life to our elders.
                         But I say we have the truth
On our side, we have the future with us;
We are millions everywhere,
on seas and oceans and lands;
In air;
On water and all over this very earth.
We are millions working together.
We are building, creating, molding life.
We are shaping the shining structures of love.
We are everywhere, we are everywhere.
We are there when they sentence us to prison for telling the truth;
We are there when they conscript us to fight their wars;
We are there when they throw us in concentration camps;
We are there when they come at dawn with their guns.
We are there, we are there,
and we say to them:
“You cannot frighten us with your bombs and deaths;
You cannot drive us away from our land with your hate and disease;
You cannot starve us with your war programs and high prices;
You cannot command us with your nothing,
Because you are nothing but nothing;
You cannot put us all in your padded jails;
You cannot snatch the dawn of life from us!”
And we say to them:
“Remember, remember,
We shall no longer wear rags, eat stale bread, live in darkness;
We shall no longer kneel on our knees to your false gods;
We shall no longer beg you for a share of life.
Remember, remember,
O remember in the deepest midnight of your fear,
We shall emulate the wonder of our women,
The ringing laughter of our children,
The strength and manhood of our men
With a true and honest and powerful love!”
And we say to them:
“We are the creators of a flowering race!”
I say I want the wide American earth.
I say to you too, sharer of my delights and thoughts,
I say this deathless truth,
And more—
                         For look, watch, listen:
With a stroke of my hand I open the dawn of a new world,
Lift up the beautiful horizon of a new life;
All for you, comrade and my love.
                                                  See:
The magnificent towers of our future is afire with truth,
And growing with the fuel of the heart of my heart,
and unfolding and unfolding, and flowering and flowering
In the bright new sun of our world;
All for you, comrade and my wife.
                                                  And see:
I cry, I weep with joy,
And my tears are the tears of my people....
Before the brave, before the proud builders and workers,
I say I want the wide American earth
For all the free,
I want the wide American earth for my people,
I want my beautiful land.
I want it with my rippling strength and tenderness
Of love and light and truth
For all the free—"
The Little Book of Cheerful Thoughts,"Small enough to fit 
in your shirt pocket
so you could take it out
in a moment of distress
to ingest a happy 
maxim or just stare
a while at its orange
and yellow cover
(so cheerful in itself
you need go no further),
this little booklet
wouldn’t stop a bullet 
aimed at your heart

and seems a flimsy 
shield against despair,
whatever its contents.
But there it is
by the cash register,
so I pick it up
as I wait in line and
come to a sentence
saying there are few
things that can’t be 
cured by a hot bath
above the name 
Sylvia Plath.

I rest my case,
placing the booklet
back by its petite
companions Sweet Nothings
and Simple Wisdom…
but not The Book of Sorrows,
a multivolume set
like the old Britannica
that each of us receives
in installments
of unpredictable
heft and frequency
over a lifetime."
"In her mostly white town, an hour from Rocky Mountain National Park, a black poet considers centuries of protests against racialized violence","Two miles into
the sky, the snow
builds a mountain
unto itself.
Some drifts can be
thirty feet high.
Picture a house.
Then bury it.
Plows come from both
ends of the road,
foot by foot, month
by month. This year
they didn’t meet
in the middle
until mid-June.
Maybe I’m not
expressing this
well. Every year,
snow erases
the highest road.
We must start near
the bottom and
plow toward each
other again."
Like a Strong Tree,"Like a strong tree that in the virgin earth 
Sends far its roots through rock and loam and clay, 
And proudly thrives in rain or time of dearth, 
When the dry waves scare rainy sprites away; 
Like a strong tree that reaches down, deep, deep, 
For sunken water, fluid underground, 
Where the great-ringed unsightly blind worms creep, 
And queer things of the nether world abound:
So would I live in rich imperial growth, 
Touching the surface and the depth of things, 
Instinctively responsive unto both, 
Tasting the sweets of being and the stings, 
Sensing the subtle spell of changing forms, 
Like a strong tree against a thousand storms. "
Entonces Mi Hija/Then My Daughter,"translated from the Spanish by María José Giménez and Anna Rosenwong
Turned to her toys and said
the first to realize
will be those who watch over the air;
those who survive
will stay away from machines
and retreat to the few remaining forests,
they will never send another text message
or their children to school,
but they will sing and mourn
the way one sprouts avocado seeds
on toothpicks;
they will speak of heavy metals in the air,
they’ll remember the names of clouds,
they’ll read in the shade of tree trunks.
Entonces Mi Hija
Se viró hacia sus juguetes y dijo
los primeros que se darán
cuenta son los que velan el aire;
los que sobrevivan
se alejarán de las máquinas
y se meterán a los pocos bosques que queden,
no enviarán más nunca un mensaje de texto
ni a sus hijos a la escuela,
pero cantarán y harán duelo
como quien siembra semillas de aguacate
con palillos de diente;
hablarán de metales pesados en el aire,
se acordarán de los nombres de las nubes,
leerán el sol en la sombra de los troncos."
Los Bustos De Martí/ The Busts Of Martí,"translated from the Spanish by María José Giménez and Anna Rosenwong
One fine day all the busts of Martí
started talking,
all the beautiful busts of Martí
began to speak Martí.
From the Martí with the chacmool body in Vedado
to the one in Villa Lugano, in Argentina,
and the one in that park in downtown Shanghai,
the world was filled with talking Martís,
busts of Martí drawn
like apostles toward Popocatépetl
along zigzagging, resonating routes
until they lined up shoulder to shoulder,
all the Martís in América
all the Martís in the world,
all the busts of Martí.
There were those who thought
it was the end times.
There were those who wanted to send
amphibious troops
journalists to interview
one of the busts of Martí,
but the chattering was so immense, so strident,
that every Martí made it impossible to hear the rest,
and they became a harmless roar,
molten lead, tree ash.
Los Bustos De Martí
Un buen día todos los bustos de Martí
comenzaron a hablar,
todos los hermosos bustos de Martí
comenzaron a parlotear a Martí.
Desde el Martí con cuerpo de Chacmol en el Vedado
hasta el de Villa Lugano, en Argentina,
o el de aquel parque tan céntrico en Shangai,
El mundo estaba lleno de Martís hablantes,
bustos de Martí que se encaminaban
como apóstoles al Popocatépetl
en rutas zigzagueantes y sonoras
hasta colocarse uno junto al otro,
todos los Martí de América,
todos los Martí del mundo,
todos los bustos de Martí.
Hubo quien creyó
que era el fin de los tiempos.
Hubo quien quiso enviar
a sus tropas anfibias
a sus periodistas para entrevistar
a alguno de los bustos de Martí,
pero el parloteo era tan masivo, estridente,
que un Martí hacia imposible escuchar al otro,
y todos a su vez se hacían rugido inofensivo,
plomo fundido, ceniza de árbol."
Flora numérica/ Numeric Flora,"translated from the Spanish by María José Giménez
One hundred and seventy-three out of every thousand women
in Alabama were named Rosa
in nineteen fifty-five.
One of them sat in a bus
that carried all of us women to a future of jobs
and museums but with an idea of justice
that roamed around the seams of the car industry.
(Some Rosas were not counted in the census
because they had just crossed the border
or just germinated.)
A girl born by caesarean who wasn’t breastfed
was the last one named Rosa
in nineteen eighty-nine.
That same year Rosanas stopped being born.
In the eighties Rosarios went extinct.
In the year nineteen ninety
not one girl was named Rosemary.
In two thousand five, one out of every thousand women
in the United States was named Rosa.
There is residue of the Big Bang in roses,
residue of radiation, there are fewer bees
on the planet pollinating those roses, there are fewer Rosas.

(Hubo Rosas que no contaron en el censo

o habían germinado).
Una niña que nació por cesárea y no lactó
fue la última en llamarse Rosa
en el mil novecientos ochenta y nueve.
Ese mismo año dejaron de nacer Rosanas.
En la década del ochenta se extinguieron las Rosario.
En el mil novecientos noventa
ninguna niña se llamó Rosemary.
En el dos mil cinco, una de cada mil mujeres
en todos los Estados Unidos se llamó Rosa.
Hay residuos del Big Bang en las rosas,
residuos de radiación, hay menos abejas
en el planeta polinizándolas, hay menos Rosas."
Heritage,"(For Harold Jackman)
What is Africa to me:
Copper sun or scarlet sea,
Jungle star or jungle track,
Strong bronzed men, or regal black
Women from whose loins I sprang
When the birds of Eden sang?
One three centuries removed
From the scenes his fathers loved,
Spicy grove, cinnamon tree,
What is Africa to me?
So I lie, who all day long
Want no sound except the song
Sung by wild barbaric birds
Goading massive jungle herds,
Juggernauts of flesh that pass
Trampling tall defiant grass
Where young forest lovers lie,
Plighting troth beneath the sky.
So I lie, who always hear,
Though I cram against my ear
Both my thumbs, and keep them there,
Great drums throbbing through the air.
So I lie, whose fount of pride,
Dear distress, and joy allied,
Is my somber flesh and skin,
With the dark blood dammed within
Like great pulsing tides of wine
That, I fear, must burst the fine
Channels of the chafing net
Where they surge and foam and fret.
Africa? A book one thumbs
Listlessly, till slumber comes.
Unremembered are her bats
Circling through the night, her cats
Crouching in the river reeds,
Stalking gentle flesh that feeds
By the river brink; no more
Does the bugle-throated roar
Cry that monarch claws have leapt
From the scabbards where they slept.
Silver snakes that once a year
Doff the lovely coats you wear,
Seek no covert in your fear
Lest a mortal eye should see;
What's your nakedness to me?
Here no leprous flowers rear
Fierce corollas in the air;
Here no bodies sleek and wet,
Dripping mingled rain and sweat,
Tread the savage measures of
Jungle boys and girls in love.
What is last year’s snow to me,
Last year’s anything? The tree
Budding yearly must forget
How its past arose or set—
Bough and blossom, flower, fruit,
Even what shy bird with mute
Wonder at her travail there,
Meekly labored in its hair.
One three centuries removed
From the scenes his fathers loved,
Spicy grove, cinnamon tree,
What is Africa to me?
So I lie, who find no peace
Night or day, no slight release
From the unremittant beat
Made by cruel padded feet
Walking through my body's street.
Up and down they go, and back,
Treading out a jungle track.
So I lie, who never quite
Safely sleep from rain at night—
I can never rest at all
When the rain begins to fall;
Like a soul gone mad with pain
I must match its weird refrain;
Ever must I twist and squirm,
Writhing like a baited worm,
While its primal measures drip
Through my body, crying, “Strip!
Doff this new exuberance.
Come and dance the Lover’s Dance!”
In an old remembered way
Rain works on me night and day.
Quaint, outlandish heathen gods
Black men fashion out of rods,
Clay, and brittle bits of stone,
In a likeness like their own,
My conversion came high-priced;
I belong to Jesus Christ,
Preacher of humility;
Heathen gods are naught to me.
Father, Son, and Holy Ghost,
So I make an idle boast;
Jesus of the twice-turned cheek,
Lamb of God, although I speak
With my mouth thus, in my heart
Do I play a double part.
Ever at Thy glowing altar
Must my heart grow sick and falter,
Wishing He I served were black,
Thinking then it would not lack
Precedent of pain to guide it,
Let who would or might deride it;
Surely then this flesh would know
Yours had borne a kindred woe.
Lord, I fashion dark gods, too,
Daring even to give You
Dark despairing features where,
Crowned with dark rebellious hair,
Patience wavers just so much as
Mortal grief compels, while touches
Quick and hot, of anger, rise
To smitten cheek and weary eyes.
Lord, forgive me if my need
Sometimes shapes a human creed.
All day long and all night through,
One thing only must I do:
Quench my pride and cool my blood,
Lest I perish in the flood.
Lest a hidden ember set
Timber that I thought was wet
Burning like the dryest flan,
Melting like the merest wax,
Lest the grave restore its dead.
Not yet has my heart or head
In the least way realized
They and I are civilized."
Song,"Lovely, dark, and lonely one, 
Bare your bosom to the sun, 
Do not be afraid of light
You who are a child of night. 
Open wide your arms to life, 
Whirl in the wind of pain and strife, 
Face the wall with the dark closed gate, 
Beat with bare, brown fists
And wait. "
The Shroud of Color,"(For Llewellyn Ransom)
“Lord, being dark,” I said, “I cannot bear
The further touch of earth, the scented air;
Lord, being dark, forewilled to that despair
My color shrouds me in, I am as dirt
Beneath my brother's heel; there is a hurt
In all the simple joys which to a child
Are sweet; they are contaminate, defiled
By truths of wrongs the childish vision fails
To see; too great a cost this birth entails.
I strangle in this yoke drawn tighter than
The worth of bearing it, just to be man.
I am not brave enough to pay the price
In full; I lack the strength to sacrifice.
I who have burned my hands upon a star,
And climbed high hills at dawn to view the far
Illimitable wonderments of earth,
For whom all cups have dripped the wine of mirth,
For whom the sea has strained her honeyed throat
Till all the world was sea, and I a boat
Unmoored, on what strange quest I willed to float;
Who wore a many-colored coat of dreams,
Thy gift, O Lord—I whom sun-dabbled streams
Have washed, whose bare brown thighs have held the sun
Incarcerate until his course was run,
I who considered man a high-perfected
Glass where loveliness could lie reflected,
Now that I sway athwart Truth's deep abyss,
Denuding man for what he was and is,
Shall breath and being so inveigle me
That I can damn my dreams to hell, and be
Content, each new-born day, anew to see
The steaming crimson vintage of my youth
Incarnadine the altar-slab of Truth?
Or hast Thou, Lord, somewhere I cannot see,
A lamb imprisoned in a bush for me?
Not so? Then let me render one by one
Thy gifts, while still they shine; some little sun
Yet gilds these thighs; my coat, albeit worn,
Still holds its colors fast; albeit torn,
My heart will laugh a little yet, if I
May win of Thee this grace, Lord: on this high
And sacrificial hill 'twixt earth and sky,
To dream still pure all that I loved, and die.
There is no other way to keep secure
My wild chimeras; grave-locked against the lure
Of Truth, the small hard teeth of worms, yet less
Envenomed than the mouth of Truth, will bless
Them into dust and happy nothingness.
Lord, Thou art God; and I, Lord, what am I
But dust? With dust my place. Lord, let me die.""
Across the earth's warm, palpitating crust
I flung my body in embrace; I thrust
My mouth into the grass and sucked the dew,
Then gave it back in tears my anguish drew;
So hard I pressed against the ground, I felt
The smallest sandgrain like a knife, and smelt
The next year's flowering; all this to speed
My body's dissolution, fain to feed
The worms. And so I groaned, and spent my strength
Until, all passion spent, I lay full length
And quivered like a flayed and bleeding thing.
So lay till lifted on a great black wing
That had no mate nor flesh-apparent trunk
To hamper it; with me all time had sunk
Into oblivion; when I awoke
The wing hung poised above two cliffs that broke
The bowels of the earth in twain, and cleft
The seas apart. Below, above, to left,
To right, I saw what no man saw before:
Earth, hell, and heaven; sinew, vein, and core.
All things that swim or walk or creep or fly,
All things that live and hunger, faint and die,
Were made majestic then and magnified
By sight so clearly purged and deified.
The smallest bug that crawls was taller than
A tree, the mustard seed loomed like a man.
The earth that writhes eternally with pain
Of birth, and woe of taking back her slain,
Laid bare her teeming bosom to my sight,
And all was struggle, gasping breath, and fight.
A blind worm here dug tunnels to the light,
And there a seed, racked with heroic pain,
Thrust eager tentacles to sun and rain;
It climbed; it died; the old love conquered me
To weep the blossom it would never be.
But here a bud won light; it burst and flowered
Into a rose whose beauty challenged, ""Coward!""
There was no thing alive save only I
That held life in contempt and longed to die.
And still I writhed and moaned, ""The curse, the curse,
Than animated death, can death be worse?""
""Dark child of sorrow, mine no less, what art
Of mine can make thee see and play thy part?
The key to all strange things is in thy heart.”
What voice was this that coursed like liquid fire
Along my flesh, and turned my hair to wire?
I raised my burning eyes, beheld a field
All multitudinous with carnal yield,
A grim ensanguined mead whereon I saw
Evolve the ancient fundamental law
Of tooth and talon, fist and nail and claw.
There with the force of living, hostile hills
Whose clash the hemmed-in vale with clamor fills,
With greater din contended fierce majestic wills
Of beast with beast, of man with man, in strife
For love of what my heart despised, for life
That unto me at dawn was now a prayer
For night, at night a bloody heart-wrung tear
For day again; for this, these groans
From tangled flesh and interlocked bones.
And no thing died that did not give
A testimony that it longed to live.
Man, strange composite blend of brute and
Pushed on, nor backward glanced where last he trod.
He seemed to mount a misty ladder flung
Pendant from a cloud, yet never gained a rung
But at his feet another tugged and clung.
My heart was still a pool of bitterness,
Would yield nought else, nought else confess.
I spoke (although no form was there
To see, I knew an ear was there to hear),
""Well, let them fight; they can whose flesh is
Crisp lightning flashed; a wave of thunder shook
My wing; a pause, and then a speaking, ""Look.""
I scarce dared trust my ears or eyes for awe
Of what they heard, and dread of what they saw;
For, privileged beyond degree, this flesh
Beheld God and His heaven in the mesh
Of Lucifer's revolt, saw Lucifer
Glow like the sun, and like a dulcimer
I heard his sin-sweet voice break on the yell
Of God's great warriors: Gabriel,
Saint Clair and Michael, Israfel and Raphael.
And strange it was to see God with His back
Against a wall, to see Christ hew and hack
Till Lucifer, pressed by the mighty pair,
And losing inch by inch, clawed at the air
With fevered wings; then, lost beyond repair,
He tricked a mass of stars into his hair;
He filled his hands with stars, crying as he fell,
""A star's a star although it burns in hell.""
So God was left to His divinity,
Omnipotent at that most costly fee.
There was a lesson here, but still the clod
In me was sycophant unto the rod,
And cried, ""Why mock me thus? Am I a god?""
""One trial more: this failing, then I give
You leave to die; no further need to live.”
Now suddenly a strange wild music smote
A chord long impotent in me; a note
Of jungles, primitive and subtle, throbbed
Against my echoing breast, and tom-toms sobbed
In every pulse-beat of my frame. The din
A hollow log bound with a python's skin
Can make wrought every nerve to ecstasy,
And I was wind and sky again, and sea,
And all sweet things that flourish, being free.
Till all at once the music changed its key.
And now it was of bitterness and death,
The cry the lash extorts, the broken breath
Of liberty enchained ; and yet there ran
Through all a harmony of faith in man,
A knowledge all would end as it began.
All sights and sounds and aspects of my race
Accompanied this melody, kept pace
With it; with music all their hopes and hates
Were charged, not to be downed by all the
And somehow it was borne upon my brain
How being dark, and living through the pain
Of it, is courage more than angels have. I knew
What storms and tumults lashed the tree that grew
This body that I was, this cringing I
That feared to contemplate a changing sky,
This that I grovelled, whining, ""Let me die,""
While others struggled in Life's abattoir.
The cries of all dark people near or far
Were billowed over me, a mighty surge
Of suffering in which my puny grief must merge
And lose itself; I had no further claim to urge
For death; in shame I raised my dust-grimed head,
And though my lips moved not, God knew I said,
""Lord, not for what I saw in flesh or bone
Of fairer men; not raised on faith alone;
Lord, I will live persuaded by mine own.
I cannot play the recreant to these;
My spirit has come home, that sailed the doubtful seas.""
With the whiz of a sword that severs space,
The wing dropped down at a dizzy pace,
And flung me on my hill flat on my face;
Flat on my face I lay defying pain,
Glad of the blood in my smallest vein,
And in my hands I clutched a loyal dream,
Still spitting fire, bright twist and coil and gleam,
And chiselled like a hound's white tooth.
""Oh, I will match you yet,"" I cried, ""to truth.""
Right glad I was to stoop to what I once had
        spurned,
Glad even unto tears; I laughed aloud; I turned
Upon my back, and though the tears for joy would run,
My sight was clear; I looked and saw the rising sun."
Minstrel Man,"Because my mouth 
Is wide with laughter
And my throat
Is deep with song,
You do not think 
I suffer after 
I have held my pain 
So long. 
Because my mouth 
Is wide with laughter, 
You do not hear
My inner cry, 
Because my feet 
Are gay with dancing, 
You do not know 
I die. "
After Reading Kobayashi Issa’s The Spring of My Life On My 49th Birthday,"On a dull December day it’s never noon 
more briefly, though what a relief 
to look around and realize our lies, in the long run,
won’t last long. 
                       I feel like the nail 
holding up someone else’s painting.
My thoughts are the loose thing 
in the dishwasher only I can hear.
When I say, Snow, what will become of this world?
it says, I was not taught future tense.
                        Through the window, 
after the heavy storm, I can follow mysterious 
paw prints to the spot along the fence 
where, in summer, the neighbors like to whisper.
They’ve taken their secrets inside.
It’s left a silence so complete, so free 
of ambition, it feels possible to know forgiveness, 
which hammered thinner than memory
carries a brighter light."

Bobolink,"In a meadow  
as wide as a wound 
I thought to stop  
and study the lesser stitchwort’s  
white flowers lacing up  
boot-level grasses 
when I was scolded in song 
by a black and white bird  
whose wings sipped air, 
swallow-like, until he landed  
on the highest tip 
of yellow dock,  
still singing his beautiful warning, 
the brown female  
with him in fear.  
The warning was real: 
the anniversary of my husband’s suicide.  
What was the matter with life? Sometimes 
when wind blows, 
the meadow moves like an ocean, 
and on that day, 
I was in its wake— 
I mean the day in the meadow. 
I mean the day he died.  
This is not another suicide poem. 
This is a poem about a bird 
I wanted to know and so 
I spent that evening looking 
up his feathers and flight,  
spent most of the night 
searching for mating habits  
and how to describe the yellow 
nape of his neck like a bit  
of gothic stained glass, 
or the warm brown 
females with a dark eyeline.  
How could I have known  
like so many species  
they too are endangered? 
God must be exhausted: 
those who chose life; 
those who chose death.  
That day I braided a few 
strips of timothy hay  
as I waited for the pair 
to move again, to lift  
from the field and what,  
live? The dead can take 
a brother, a sister; not really.  
The dead have no one.  
Here in this field  
I worried the mowers 
like giant gorging mouths 
would soon begin again 
and everything would be  
as it will."
Venetian Siesta,"I know I’m getting away with a crime
stretched out on the couch
and listening to rain
making a hole in the afternoon
through which I can drift slowly away
for sleep is sometimes
just as delicious
as white polenta and grilled angle fish.
So I give up my hands,
my tears and my face,
the smells of tar,
damp rope and mud,
the late slanted light of November
rippling below on the gondola wood
and then I count backwards from 27
trying to pretend I’m Wallace Stevens
he of the freakish intellect
and the taste of a ruthless
wandering gourmet
who rummages in the mystical kitchen
in search of oranges and café espresso
or a blown glass peacock
or a Byzantine horse
cast in some delicate metal.
He speaks of the world,
how it’s changed by art
and bread you can’t eat
powdered with light
where someone is toasting
their mother’s health
and someone is writing a letter to death
which makes things beautiful
in its way
and also makes everyone the same
as laughter does
or the late autumn rain."
The Other Side of Nowhere,"Thirty feet above the ground, in a warehouse 
in the industrial outskirts 
of a city we’d never lived in,
I knelt inside the near-empty container
to contemplate our nomadic misery: 
mismatched chairs, kitchen appliances 
older than me, baby clothes, 
framed diplomas, books in a language 
my father never taught me (it would 
have stunted my assimilation) 
and in my head, an email from my mother 
that read, “we’re doomed, save what you can.”
So there I was, on the other 
side of nowhere in sunny Italy… Despite 
the technological changes around us, 
disasters still travel in telegrams: Bankrupt. STOP. 
Sorry. STOP. Homeless. STOP… 
Remember, brother, 
when our parents calling us 
‘global citizens’ inspired great hope?
But the world proved too tribal for us
and so your suitcase shall be your only friend 
while Shi Huang’s fantasy of a Godly Wall 
proliferates across the planet. 
Weeks ago, two cops in Catania 
stung a sixteen year old boy from Darfur
with cattle-prods to impart the following lesson, 
‘whatever the government says, 
you’re not welcome here.’ 
As if one needed the reminder… 
All across the boot, the green-
shirted faithful lift their pitchforks 
to chase the monster of Otherness, 
so don’t ask me why I love 
to leave and hate returning. 
(Is the answer somewhere inside this container?
It isn’t… but remember Cicero’s saying,
there’s no cure for exile except to love 
every city as you would your own, 
but the past is always easier… ) 
When I was young, I fancied 
myself Indiana Jones; later, 
with erudition, came realer idols: 
Petrie, Schliemann, Carter, Kenyon—
but you cannot rescue history from dust—
all you save one day will crumble 
in your hand. “Trash or burn the rest” 
I told the warehouse worker 
as we rode the forklift back to earth. 
Damn whoever said 
that hell was down below;
they clearly never went there.
  Florence"
Near the End of April,"Near the end of April
    On the verge of May—
And o my heart, the woods were dusk
    At the close of day.
Half a word was spoken
    Out of half a dream,
And God looked in my soul and saw
    A dawn rise and gleam.
Near the end of April
    Twenty Mays have met,
And half a word and half a dream
    Remember and forget."
I Never Wanted to Die,"It’s the best part of the day, morning light sliding
down rooftops, treetops, the birds pulling themselves
up out of whatever stupor darkened their wings,
night still in their throats.
I never wanted to die. Even when those I loved
died around me, away from me, beyond me. 
My life was never in question, if for no other reason
than I wanted to wake up and see what happened next. 
And I continue to want to open like that, like the flowers
who lift their heavy heads as the hills outside the window
flare gold for a moment before they turn
on their sides and bare their creased backs.
Even the cut flowers in a jar of water lift
their soon to be dead heads and open
their eyes, even they want a few more sips,
to dwell here, in paradise, a few days longer."
Llorona,"All the public places I’ve cried:
airports, beaches, parking lots—
so many—waiting rooms,
parks, train platforms,
benches. Whose loss
is shed? The bluish distillate
in Rilke’s saucerless cup
was watered down with tears
to be more bearable.
In this morning’s coffee
tears dissolved like comets
into darkness. If I need a good cry
I watch that astronaut singing
“Major Tom,” playing his guitar.
Astronaut tears are Jell-O.
Even this physics makes my heart
confetti. You’re too emotional,
you said, as my eyes irrigated
the flower beds. In India, Colombia,
Chile, Japan, and the Philippines,
you can still hire a professional
mourner. Crying in public
ought to be easier. Designated
trees or hilltops might help.
Or an hour of tears,
when we can howl in unison
and then return to our
diluteness. I mean dailiness.
Crying is inevitable
when headlines read
like requiems. When
Cihuacoatl prophesied
the conquest of Mexico
all she could do was cry.
  LLORONA
Todos los lugares públicos donde he llorado:
aeropuertos, playas, parqueaderos
—tantos— salas de espera,
parques, andenes de trenes,
bancos. ¿La pérdida de quién
se derrama? El destilado azul
en la taza sin platillo de Rilke
fue diluido con lágrimas
para ser más soportable.
En el café de esta mañana
mis lágrimas se disolvieron como cometas
en la oscuridad. Si necesito un buen llanto
miro a ese astronauta cantando
“Mayor Tom,” tocando su guitarra.
Las lágrimas de astronauta son gelatina.
Esta física hace de mi corazón
confeti. Eres demasiado emocional,
dijiste, mientras mis ojos irrigaban
las flores. En la India, Colombia,
Chile, Japón y Filipinas,
todavía puedes contratar a una plañidera
profesional. Llorar en público
debería ser más fácil. Designados
árboles o cimas de colinas podrían ayudar.
O una hora de lágrimas,
cuando podemos aullar al unísono
y luego volver a nuestra
diligencia, a lo diario.
El llanto es inevitable
cuando los titulares suenan
como réquiems. Cuando
Cihuacoatl profetizó
la conquista de México
lo único que podía hacer era llorar."
Overlooking the Cortile,"for T
Late winter yet we stood at the open window
Its green wood shutters pushed back like wings
Against the walls of the ancient building
We stood at the aperture of the narrow room
Looking down onto the fountain in the cortile
Her old room now mine & she said nothing
Of the year she’d slept here
Knowing the Russian painter she loved
Was out somewhere on the streets of Rome
Walking with his Contessa every evening at dusk
As the grief of a rossignol ran down the stones of
The faded wall just outside her window & along the ivy
Seeping slowly as water from the lips of Orpheus
& those liquid sobs of a Roman nightingale"
Narwhals Are Real,"a student announces—proclaims—
on a February Tuesday, leading to
a week-long deep dive
of researching you, Narwhal,
horned and mystical depth dweller
I haven’t thought much about
until now. One-toothed wonder,
you whirl open to devour prey whole.
I would expect nothing less.
On the Internet, you have a cult
following, unicorn of the sea—
crocheted into one-horned beanies,
printed on T-shirts and mugs
and phone cases, tattooed across backs.
There’s a plushie of you with a mustache
and a monocle, a beanbag chair,
an enamel pin, night slippers, and meme
after meme after meme. Your eyes
are always wide and kind. A blogger
I stumbled upon has I’m obsessed
with narwhals! as the first line
of her bio. And how couldn’t we be?
In this month of love, I’ll call this
a valentine, Narwhal. In Inuktitut
your name means “the one point
to the sky.” This month we launched
the heaviest rocket into outer space.
As I watched the slow burn
of the descending boosters, I thought
of you, Narwhal. How your horn
is a needle on a record, skipping
heartbeats. How your pulse plummets
as you swirl into the arctic dark.
    NARVALES EXISTEN
un estudiante anuncia —proclama—
un martes en febrero, mandándome
en una semana entera de inmersión
en investigación de tí, Narval, cornudo
y místico habitante de la profundidad
sobre el cuál hasta ahora no he pensado mucho.
Fenómeno monodentado
te devanas para devorar a tu presa entera.
Espero nada menos de ti.
En el Internet, tienes un seguimiento
de culto, unicornio del mar
—tejido en una gorra con cuerno
imprimido en camisetas, tazas
y estuches de teléfono, tatuado en espaldas.
Hay un peluche de tí con un bigote
y monóculo, una silla saco de semillas,
un alfiler de esmalte, zapatillas de noche y meme
después de meme después de meme de tí. Tus ojos
son siempre grandes y generosos. Una bloguera
que encontré tiene ¡estoy obsesionada
con narvales! como la primera frase
de su bio. ¿Y cómo no estarlo?
En este mes del amor, voy a llamar este poema
un valentine, Narval. En Inuktitut
tu nombre significa el punto
al cielo. Este mes lanzamos
la nave más pesada al espacio exterior.
Mientras veía el lento arder
de los impulsores descendiendo, pensé en ti,
Narval. Cómo tu cuerno es una aguja
en un disco, saltando latidos del corazón.
Cómo se desploma tu pulso
mientras arremolinas en el oscuro ártico."
Signals,"Every mother stitches her children
out of superstitions. We decide
this as we talk about pregnancy
under Walgreens’ incandescence.
That W—more balloon animal
than letter—loops up, embraces
itself, and presents its fullness:
a totem, stone fertility
goddess, headless
and full-bodied.
These signals catch me
more frequently these days.
The curve of a grapefruit,
the rev of an engine, peonies,
aquarium’s sea horses,
a quarter’s ridge, a quarter slot,
my neighbor’s wind chimes,
blue jay, a swollen tea bag,
morning shower steam, malachite
mound on my nightstand,
your guttural snoring,
anything in bloom. I am
collecting them, listening
closely, waiting for a voice
to reach through time
to say ready.
I grew up with a mother
who sought signals from everything.
This Thanksgiving again
my childlessness is on the table,
wedged between the canned beets
and empanadas. My molars
crush the butter and salt
from the Brussels sprouts. I add this
popping of leafy heads to my list.
I’ve known the names
of my unborn children
for years. Yet saying them aloud
feels elegiac. When I think
of having a child, I’m confronted
by the latest National Geographic
centerfold of ice floes detached
from an iceberg.
Lost in the continuously
dissolving world, I keep
collecting: the shape of tea leaves,
rain clouds, crease lines
my hand makes when its balled
into a fist. Meaning maybe
my body is only meant
to carry my ocean?"

Memory is Blood Soluble,"I am still the old man with the street organ and cat, turning the same crank and expecting moonlight. What I remember: smoke of houses on the riverbank. Storm on mute. Temple broken, lamb-entered. You loved my bones because they were white. In the gathering blindness, you bandaged my body, and in doing so made it my body. I can’t remember which chord heals visions or causes them. Which summons a cloud of b­­­ees from the stone, or conceals your shape behind a flame. It is every guitar I have found in the gutter. Every name on the edge of being gone."
Pastoral,"Together,
you
standing
before me before
the picture
window, my arms
around you, our
eyes pitched
beyond our
reflections into—
(“into,” I’d
written, as
though there
swung at the end
of a tunnel,
a passage dotted
with endless
points of
arrival, as
though our gaze
started just outside
our faces and
corkscrewed its way
toward the horizon,
processual, 
as if looking
took time to happen
and weren’t
instantaneous,
offered whole in
one gesture
before we
ask, before our
will, as if the far
Sonoma mountains
weren’t equally ready
to be beheld as
the dead
fly on the sill)—
the distance, a
broad hill of
bright mustard flowers
the morning light
coaxes open."
Youth,"We have tomorrow
Bright before us

Broad arch above the road we came.

Grief Dream,"When he appears, he looks into my eyes
With the gaze of a child missing a perfected
Will. Then, like a child, he moves suddenly—
Insisting on his own space, summoning up that
Odd power that makes us seem real to ourselves.
His life failed him. Fame, which he had in hand,
Failed him. He believed it was because he chose me.
When I catch or remember his ripped-from-pure-terror
Characters onscreen and off (murderer, father, diplomat)—
I get that he was always a version of the liability of “us.”
He comes to me alone in dreams, spinning into a glimpse
Of such blue-eyed hate it might have been love—O
I was never sure of that living kid on the lit stage,
Floating now into the twentieth year of his death."
Life and Death,"                                    Life
I saw the candle brightly burning in the room! 
The fringed curtains gracefully draped back, 
The windows, crystal clear! 
Upon the generous hearth
Quick Wit and bubbling Laughter
    Flashed and danced
    Sparkled and pranced,
And music to the glowing scene lent cheer.
It was a gracious sight, 
So full of life, of love, of light! 
                                    Death 
Then suddenly I saw a cloud of gloom
Take form within the room:
A blue-grey mist obscured the window-panes
And silent fell the rout!
Then from the shadows came the Dreaded Shape,—
The candle flickered out!"
Knowledge,"Now that I know
How passion warms little
Of flesh in the mould,
And treasure is brittle,—
I’ll lie here and learn
How, over their ground,
Trees make a long shadow
And a light sound."
Nothing Wants to Suffer,"after Linda Hogan
Nothing wants to suffer. Not the wind
as it scrapes itself against the cliff. Not the cliff
being eaten, slowly, by the sea. The earth does not want
to suffer the rough tread of those who do not notice it.
The trees do not want to suffer the axe, nor see
their sisters felled by root rot, mildew, rust. 
The coyote in its den. The puma stalking its prey.
These, too, want ease and a tender animal in the mouth
to take their hunger. An offering, one hopes, 
made quickly, and without much suffering.
The chair mourns an angry sitter. The lamp, a scalded moth.
A table, the weight of years of argument.
We know this, though we forget.
Not the shark nor the tiger, fanged as they are.
Nor the worm, content in its windowless world
of soil and stone. Not the stone, resting in its riverbed.
The riverbed, gazing up at the stars.
Least of all, the stars, ensconced in their canopy,
looking down at all of us— their offspring—
scattered so far beyond reach."
"House Empty Speaks a Loud Truth, 2018","for Charmian Kittredge London
1.      House made of breath exhaled from wooden ribs.
2.      Dale Carnegie’s name scribbled on a cream closet door.
3.      A nautilus shell eating a light bulb sheds the softest light.
4.      Calabashes painted grey sway from their ropes whenever the earth shakes. (Someone tried to mute their color).
5.      She designed the house so that it would never burn.
6.      The rock patio has a pyramid-shaped staircase that leads up and over the edge.
7.      Left unattended, I slid every window latch open, shimmied through sliding doors.
8.      You could hear the red-breasted robins singing from the second floor.
9.      The silver painted wallpaper came off on my fingertips.
10.    What they thought was a guest room was actually her office.
11.    When the state cataloged the house, everyone forgot she was a writer.
12.     It never burned.
13.     Bays and oaks move closer to the house. (Hear their leaves whisper?)
14.     Though they'll cover the fountain in the sun-filled dining room, its waters will keep broadcasting to future visitors."

Sonnet III: “Mindful of you the sodden earth in spring”,"Mindful of you the sodden earth in spring,
    And all the flowers that in the springtime grow,
    And dusty roads, and thistles, and the slow
Rising of the round moon, all throats that sing
The summer through, and each departing wing,
    And all the nests that the bared branches show,
    And all winds that in any weather blow,
And all the storms that the four seasons bring.
You go no more on your exultant feet
    Up paths that only mist and morning knew,
Or watch the wind, or listen to the beat
    Of a bird’s wings too high in air to view,—
But you were something more than young and sweet
    And fair,—and the long year remembers you."
Rock Paper Scissors,"         Midnight snow swirls in the courtyard—
                 you wake and mark the steel-gray light of dawn,
                           the rhythm in your hands
                           of scissors cutting paper;
         you pull a blade against ribbon,
                    and the ribbon springs into a spiraling curl 
                                        when you release it;
         here, no one pulled a blade against the ribbon of desire,
                  a downy woodpecker drilled into a desiccated pear tree; 
         you consider how paper wraps rock,
                                         scissors snips paper,
         how this game embodies the evolution
                                         of bacteria and antibiotic;
         you can’t see your fingerprints on a door handle,
                   but your smudging,
                                       like trudging footprints in snow,
         track where and how you go—
                             wrapping
                             a chrysoprase heart in a box—
         how you look at a series of incidentals
                               and pull an invisible thread through them all."
After Graduate School,"Needless to say I support the forsythia’s war
against the dull colored houses, the beagle
deciphering the infinitely complicated universe
at the bottom of a fence post. I should be gussying up
my resume, I should be dusting off my protestant work ethic,
not walking around the neighborhood loving the peonies
and the lilac bushes, not heading up Shamrock
and spotting Lucia coming down the train tracks. Lucia
who just sold her first story and whose rent is going up,
too, Lucia who says she’s moving to South America to save money,
Lucia, cute twenty-something I wish wasn’t walking down train tracks
alone. I tell her about my niece teaching in China, about the waiter
who built a tiny house in Hawaii, how he saved up, how
he had to call the house a garage to get a building permit.
Someone’s practicing the trumpet, someone’s frying bacon
and once again the wisteria across the street is trying to take over
the nation. Which could use a nice invasion, old growth trees
and sea turtles, every kind of bird marching
on Washington. If I had something in my refrigerator,
if my house didn’t look like the woman who lives there
forgot to water the plants, I’d invite Lucia home,
enjoy another hour of not thinking about not having a job,
about not having a mother to move back in with.
I could pick Lucia’s brain about our circadian rhythms,
about this space between sunrise and sunset,
ask if she’s ever managed to get inside it, the air,
the sky ethereal as all get out—so close
and no ladder in sight."
"A Financial Planner Asks About My Goals, or Golden Shovel with Cardi B’s “Money”","Never touch-starved again, forever a chub-bellied baby sexed big
Skin a heatmapped catalogue of hands still wet still grasping still blood-fat
Behind every steam-slammed door, playplush beds as good as checks
Whole home stitched with only these rooms, only this near-rip big
Kitchen table perfect island for the stranding, meals propped heaven-large
Backyard a honey-dripped grove named Eden, ripe land of no bills
Whatever drops first, spice-adorned, sauce slicked back-to-front
Splayed open slow, tempting a spill, grateful to be devoured like I’ll
Make my giggling groommates, spit-tethered hips churned tender flip
Down smeared-open mouths or whole wedding cakes or any drown we like
Just measure by the fistful how thick this slick can coat a sigh, add ten
And that’d be balm enough to dizzytrip my lonely and her cartwheels"
An Earth Song,"It's an earth song,—
And I've been waiting long for an earth song. 
It's a spring song,—
And I've been waiting long for a spring song. 
    Strong as the shoots of a new plant 
    Strong as the bursting of new buds
    Strong as the coming of the first child from its mother's womb. 
It's an earth song, 
A body song, 
A spring song, 
I have been waiting long for this spring song. "
44 Questions to Ask While Bingeing,"After Benji Hart
How many hands have touched this food?
What were their intentions?
How vast is the range?
What makes them hands at all?
How many seeds survived their birth for this?
Did you count yourself?
From sprout to pluck, how many breaths old was the oldest?
What’s become of its homeland?
How many breaths will it add to yours?
Or is this a thing that takes?
Which things were born dead for this?
Did you count yourself?
Which born free?
Which born food?
Is there a state in-between?
How old was the well of that answer?
If governments and their signed scrolls are Plato’s cave wall shadows, where is the real sun?
What’s become of its homeland?
How many generations removed from the land are you?
What floor takes its place?
What is it built on top of?
Are the people who tended that place still alive?
Are there any living descendants?
Is their language still spoken on earth?
If you heard it, would your feet twitch?
Or does dead mean gone?
How many gone things in your place?
Did you count yourself?
What does your body and the day it makes cost?
What is its price, in gone things?
Is this sustainable? Better—regenerative?
Or will this make you the most gone thing alive?
Is god or the human the cave wall shadow?
Who says the shadow is nothing at all?
Are you still eating?
Who?
What for?
What have you grown in its place?
How much is enough?
Is enough a place or a count?
Is there a state in-between?
Or does enough mean gone?
Did you enough yourself?
In the language of the oldest gone thing, how do you say devour?"
"Undelivered Message to the Sky: November 9, 2016","You were in my dream last night. Titanic falling.
Every cop siren pocking your blue. Shots fired
fired far above my head by trembling men, and then
a terrible rain.          Still, you sank,
and all the creatures bowed—except the humans.
We broke ourselves screaming, but there was no sound.
In that silence, something wicked came aloud.
Before you landed, nothing left but littered,
gaping mouths. When I woke up,
I felt it. A twitching in my teeth.
The rumble of a nearby rapture. I opened the blinds
and a pack of white women were wailing down Maple,
crying into potholes, writhing in the street
like worms. One saw me, then the wails grew
and turned into a chorus of sorry sorry sorry
so sorry we’re sorry and I wished Yemoja
would sling an ocean out my throat. But all I had
was English—blindfolds, trick knives,
no real magic. Nothing in their language
makes them disappear. That’s why the guns
and cages. Why they cut our tongues. Because
we would call, and you would come."
Theory of Plate Tectonics,"She says New England hoards college girls like cherries in its cheek,
tongue-tying legs to knots, making party tricks out of people.
Says it’s an old currency, wads of tangled stems tumored with
unfinished bows. Says the quick ones learn to curl like ribbon.
The brave ones learn to run with their hands. The pretty ones
knot and knot into rope and callus, none of their blood stays long.
But half butane, half lemon juice, all pit, no skin, us sad ones
are a new fruit. I tell her we should shower more. Eat something
besides black pepper and rum. I tell her darling, the teapot’s
melted to the stove, the mugs chipped in hazardous places,
dropped from scalded hands to blades, stealing lips from our guests.
She reminds me we have no guests here, just the half-dead boys
we’ve specialized in trapping, leggy never-giants too grateful
to run so now cups brimming with sliced mouths, kitchen table
littered with scabs, we pick over the charred parts: thirteen matchheads
sawed from stems with his sharpest key (ours now); half a collarbone,
still warm (ours now); the lightbulb he almost smashed into her throat
when he learned not all flightless soft-bodied girls are fireflies
(ours to shatter in the rooftop shadows just like one of us).
She tells me Paris is all glitter and ash this time of year,
red-velvet gloved and scowled. Tells me Cape Town paves its streets with wings
that shimmy for stray coins. Says she’s got a naked man waiting
in Havana and his neighbor owes her seven cigarettes.
She’s been studying plate tectonics. Whispering spells for Pangaea.
Lighting candles for the Great Rift Valley with bootleg magma
from Kilimanjaro. Branding Himalayas to her calves’
Appalachia. Speed testing smoke signals hitched to waves.
She asks me the difference between arson and wildfire.
I say arson is chain-smoking with her Tinder wax doll collection.
Wildfire misusing match blaze as daylight. Should have said
the difference depends on what’s burning. Should have said
we have such old bones for such new people, more cinder than marrow.
We feel safe in all the wrong places, most at home in flames."
When Love,"when love floods a person
            it cuts
a canyon
that deepens year after year
            carrying silt
away leaving
the essential person
            revealed
letting everyone see
the layers of yellow
            sandstone, red basalt
grey granite
when love washes over a person
                        it washes
the person away"
Love Song,"When my soul touches yours a great chord sings!
How shall I tune it then to other things?
O! That some spot in darkness could be found
That does not vibrate when’er your depth sound.
But everything that touches you and me
Welds us as played strings sound one melody.
Where is the instrument whence the sounds flow?
And whose the master-hand that holds the bow?
O! Sweet song—"
A Amazônia está queimando,"               I
               We sing and dance in praise of the butterfly—
               translucent blue,
               gilded wings,
               dances—
               all its life
               from orchid to cacao,
               ceiba to banana and fig,
               tying invisible strings
               that hold our home in the sky.
               It must,
               lest we drop 
               into an abyss,
               or drift 
               where the gods won’t find us.
               This place 
               where butterflies work 
               for you and me,
               keep rivers full and flowing—
               Amapari, Canapantuba and Feliz,
               the wide and deep goddess far beyond we call the Sea,
               Rain—floods and drought,
               a mist or fog,
               the sun finds us each dawn
               after a journey home,
               when the moon comes to guide 
               both the weary and the ready
               to pounce and hide—
               our home is burning.
               II
               Menacing fires blaze.
               Moneyed Whites rid the earth
               of the people,
               anacondas and spider monkeys,
               hawks and toucans,
               cicadas and cinnamon,
               glass frogs and vines,
               palm and rubber trees,
               tapirs and manatees.
               We hear their screams
               And all that dies silently.
               A Amazônia está queimando.
               They want our abundant lands
               and to annihilate our Mother’s opulence.
               They will end the dance of the butterflies
               and then what?  
               We, too, will die
               like in a story told by the ancestors
               that we only imagined.
               They come for our copper, gold, ore
               Ranchers and loggers raze the land.
               At the United Nations Bolsonaro1 announced,
               Don’t listen to what you hear on the news. Lies.
               Nothing is burning, nothing has been set ablaze.
               III
               We are Waiapi.
               We keep the butterflies happy.
               They stay working
               to hold the planet in place.
               We are the guardians
               of our Mother. 
               Each day before I go to school, 
               I smear the sweet juice of urucum seeds
               on my body and face.
               They are protection 
               from insects and evil spirits.
               I sit in a classroom with thatched roof 
               and other Waiapi women.
               I am the only grandmother there.
               I am Chief of my people.
               I will learn to write and speak
               for the butterfly
               to those who set fires 
               and to the ones who may help 
               save our home.

Winter to Spring,"Did not I remember that my hair is grey
    With only a fringe of it left,
I’d follow your footsteps from wee break of day
    Till night was of moon-light bereft.
Your eyes wondrous fountains of joy and of youth
    Remind me of days long since flown,
My sweetheart, I led to the altar of truth,
    But then the gay spring was my own.
Now winter has come with its snow and its wind
    And made me as bare as its trees,
Oh, yes, I still love, but it’s only in mind,
    For I’m fast growing weak at the knees.
Your voice is as sweet as the song of a bird, 
    Your manners are those of the fawn,
I dream of you, darling,—oh, pardon, that word,
    From twilight to breaking of dawn.
Your name in this missive you’ll search for in vain,
    Nor mine at the finis, I’ll fling,
For winter must suffer the bliss and the pain 
In secret for loving the spring."
One More Love Poem,"If I had one more day
I would write a love poem
composed of one word
repeated like binary code.
I’ll multiply it by the number
of days that passed 
without saying it to you
and I’ll add the days
when I said it with no words
because I want to say it 
more. And like a bee 
gathering pollen, I’ll collect 
everything ever said 
in one word like a square root
multiplied by the power of ten.
I’ll count even that day
when my anger at you
or for you turned me into 
a stone, and also the days 
when I was away
sending my songs like 
postcards to the lonely,
feeling you in every touch 
of love I gave to the world.
I’ll count all my days,
even the nine months of days 
before I was born, to say  
this exponential, growing “I love you.”"
Love Poem -1: Chicago (CST) to Bangalore (GMT +5:30),"Then love was a phone ding’s dopamine thimble
instead of revolution, our green and singing world.
My day your night. Your day
my husking, skin to bark to sap rot.
No pixels, no disembodied voice teched towards me
reassembled you here.
Both feet missing. Inner ears gone.
Top of your head, merely suspect.
Each eye’s prism, flattened.
The geometry of your chest, lost math.
The godweld between us taffied,
split back to word and light.
Its reconfigured data—
your slick hologram—
my dearest friend who refused
to touch me."
The Lonely Sleep Through Winter,"I say hunger and mean your hands bitten to boneseed,
bandaged with bedsheet and the night while two states over,
a mouth—ready soil—says your name. Next June’s lover
speaks the harvest: your rich, vowel-tender song
but for the neighbor. More hello than amen. Not yet
a whole book of psalms. Choose this. Not your bare room.
Your self-vacancies. Unlearn empire’s blackness:
night spun savage, space cast empty when really
a balm slicks the split between stars. Really
hipthick spirits moonwalk across the lake ice.
Maps to every heaven gauze the trees in velvet
between that greenbright spectacle of bud and juice
and dust—I’m saying there’s no such thing
as nothing. Try and try, you’ll never disappear.
I say hunger, mean hands you think empty
though everywhere, even the dark, heaves."
My Einsteinicity,"Let y equal any number of fathers.
Let x equal the numberless planets.
Let y minus x equal long nights of fog
and let x plus y equal hydra & incubus.
If y is > x, why do all my convictions gape?
If x is > y, does “father” just mean nightcap?
When x ÷ y, we set sail on a windjammer.
When y ÷ x, watch for the banshee, the jinn.
Or let x be replaced by a midsummer night
and y by—well, you can never replace y but
by morning y will lollygag near half-moons:
Odysseus sailing to Ithaca, mildew as it rots.
And a b is no mere theory of relativity: it is
helter-skelter materfamilias, Ma Barker, and
Rebekkah, the mother who deceived. Not
Sarah who couldn’t conceive nor the Mother
of all of Nature: the black tern, the kittiwake;
plants ornamental, baroque; the cumulous,
the nebulosus; and yet, mother-of-pearl and
ice-cold, tiger’s-eye and monkey in the middle.
Let’s say a b is a % of all the love in the world
or synonymous with do you love me now that
I can dance? Let’s agree that a is the salsa or
paso doble and b is always always the beguine."
La suavecita,"We dress my daughter in amarillo, not butter
or sunlight or mirasol, maybe an Easter yellow,
maybe a Dia de los muertos yellow, a baby chick
yellow, it doesn’t matter. She flickers
around the house all bare-foot.  She takes you
by the hand and makes you play
La Suavecita on repeat, her hair in brown
bouncy pig-tails. All day. She watches 
your mouth, the way you say tambores,
the way you say cumbia. She won’t stop smiling. 
When she laughs I hear my mother. I am 
back in her house, all bare-foot, dancing 
to the same song. 
My mother dresses in a teal bata, not Miami
or peacock or Tiffany Blue, maybe an Easter teal,
maybe a Dia de los muertos teal, a robin egg 
teal, it doesn’t matter. She flitters
around the house. She takes me
by the hand and teaches me how to spring
my arms, how to move my hips,
how to follow the beat already in my legs.
She tells me,
ay mijo, one day, las muchachas
will want to spend the night with you
on the dance floor. Find those feather feet. 
Carry a smile and laugh, mijo laugh. 
I ask to play the song again and run
to rewind the cassette tape. All day.
My mother is all baila, baila,
all brown curls of bobbing hair
abriendo sus brazos the moment
I learn how to spin her in
our shot-gun house.  She won’t stop smiling.
My mother loves the color yellow.
There is a sing, a flow around inside.
My daughter ooooos the color teal.
When they lay eyes on each other, they watch
each others’ mouths, see just who smiles first.
I’m just here, waiting to see who wants to dance
—si no la invito, me invita ella."
The Roots Do a Live Cover of Mayfield's “Move On Up”,
How Many Lives Have We Lived in Paris?,"We’ve lived the life of an unbridled boy 
Mastering the higgledy-piggledy metro, 
Tapping the fast-moving window,
Loving the a cappella names 
Of the heralded stations:
Saint-Paul, Bastille, Gare de Lyon—
*
The life of a downtrodden clochard,  
Sly, indigent alley crone, 
Still wrestling to recover 
A long-deterred tune:  
Chevalier, dauphin, Parisian charmer,
Don’t you know I’m blue without your wink?
*
The life of a pendant, park-facing willow, 
Oh sweet, avuncular life—
*
Incarnation of a curling swan—
*
The life of an insouciant schoolgirl 
Boulevard-prancing then skipping
In the candle-pale voile of her lark-
Light Corpus Christi dress—
*
Life of a heartfelt nun whispering novenas
And bidding God’s blessèd day adieu—
*
The taciturn, time-and-again life 
Of a ringlet-haired racehorse
On a raucous kids’ carousel:
Its red-gold, undignified Sundays—  
*
Fat life of a tantalized basilica tomcat
Chasing a fly-by-night sparrow in the pews—
*
The jubilant life of a sweetheart, answering 
Yes, oh yes, I will,
Mon amour, trésor,
You can toss your hat now into the air—"
"O Sea, That Knowest Thy Strength","Hast thou been known to sing,
        O sea, that knowest thy strength?
Hast thou been known to sing? 
        Thy voice, can it rejoice?
Naught save great sorrowing,
        To me, thy sounds incessant
Do express, naught save great sorrowing.
Thy lips, they daily kiss the sand,
        In wanton mockery.
Deep in thine awful heart
        Thou dost not love the land.
        Thou dost not love the land.
        O sea, that knowest thy strength.

“These sands, these listless, helpless,
        Sun-gold sands, I’ll play with these,
Or crush them in my white-fanged hands
        For leagues, to please
The thing in me that is the Sea,
        Intangible, untamed,
        Untamed and wild,
        And wild and weird and strong!”"
Ode to Sitting in a Booth,"It’s the closest thing to a cave. I have to resist
this wild urge to carve a name or word in it.
My favorite way to sit here is with cold vodka
& grapefruit juice & whatever bitter concoction
you’re sipping. Under the table I’ll nudge you
with my heels—a sign no stalactite or dripstone
will stop us. Bats do not require any energy
to claw-dangle upside down. All they need
is to relax & gravity & there’s plenty of both
swirling to go around. No matter how loud
this bar, within these three walls we can drop
straight into a very electric flight. We can
pretend we don’t answer to anyone–including
the waitress–& no one even knows where we are."
to hold these contradictions in kinship,"forming an arrowhead, ibises carry each other in the direction of
what i want to read as a glyph of hope.
i walk east—a parking lot almost burns—the dusk blushes,
lukewarm—then i’m back again on the balcony of my university
building six and half years ago before we met, wind transporting
brush sediments towards approaching summer.
those jacarandas and tolerant native vines—auspicious walks on
hot nights, a feline rolls her body in dirt. under this sky, i nurse
a kindling.
you feel gone more than ever. your shoulder turns over into
another bed. shadows lean into my neck like ink spill, reminding
me of those ibises and how i should proceed.
in absence, i despise what you’ve become, what you’ve always
been, a secret set loose and this body who prays for your
reckoning."
I am the Apsara’s daughter,"for Soriya
I wander in her forest
hearing ankle bells jingle with each step,
the universe at her feet and hands. 
I want to touch her.
She flies in my house in paintings
with petals of orange blossom raining from the ceiling.
With her bas-relief tattooed on my skin 
I worry I’ve offended the deity.
In my dreams I cry out to her, 
                        នាងខ្ញុំ
                        កូនស្រី
                        របស់ព្រះអង្គ ។
I am still learning
as I copy myself in her image.
To she who abides in the sea of milk—
I try to churn my own from motherhood.
I hope it worthy an offering for this nymph of clouds and sky."
Fruit of the Flower,"My father is a quiet man
    With sober, steady ways;
For simile, a folded fan;
    His nights are like his days.
My mother's life is puritan,
    No hint of cavalier,
A pool so calm you're sure it can
    Have little depth to fear.
And yet my father's eyes can boast
    How full his life has been;
There haunts them yet the languid ghost
    Of some still sacred sin.
And though my mother chants of God,
    And of the mystic river,
I've seen a bit of checkered sod
    Set all her flesh aquiver.
Why should he deem it pure mischance
    A son of his is fain
To do a naked tribal dance
    Each time he hears the rain?
Why should she think it devil's art
    That all my songs should be
Of love and lovers, broken heart,
    And wild sweet agony?
Who plants a seed begets a bud,
    Extract of that same root;
Why marvel at the hectic blood
    That flushes this wild fruit?"

To My Fairer Brethren,"Though I score you with my best,
    Treble circumstance
Must confirm the verdict, lest
    It be laid to chance.
Insufficient that I match you
    Every coin you flip;
Your demand is that I catch you
    Squarely on the hip.
Should I wear my wreaths a bit
    Rakishly and proud,
I have bought my right to it;
    Let it be allowed."
Wisdom Cometh With the Years,"Now I am young and credulous,
    My heart is quick to bleed
At courage in the tremulous
    Slow sprouting of a seed.
Now I am young and sensitive,
    Man's lack can stab me through;
I own no stitch I would not give
    To him that asked me to.
Now I am young and a fool for love,
    My blood goes mad to see
A brown girl pass me like a dove
    That flies melodiously.
Let me be lavish of my tears,
    And dream that false is true;
Though wisdom cometh with the years,
    The barren days come, too."
Pagan Prayer,"Not for myself I make this prayer,
    But for this race of mine
That stretches forth from shadowed places
    Dark hands for bread and wine.
For me, my heart is pagan mad,
    My feet are never still,
But give them hearths to keep them warm
    In homes high on a hill.
For me, my faith lies fallowing,
    I bow not till I see,
But these are humble and believe;
    Bless their credulity.
For me, I pay my debts in kind,
    And see no better way,
Bless these who turn the other cheek
    For love of you, and pray.
Our Father, God, our Brother, Christ—
    So are we taught to pray;
Their kinship seems a little thing
    Who sorrow all the day.
Our Father, God; our Brother, Christ,
    Or are we bastard kin,
That to our plaints your ears are closed,
    Your doors barred from within?
Our Father, God; our Brother, Christ,
    Retrieve my race again;
So shall you compass this black sheep,
    This pagan heart. Amen."
The Dance of Love,"after reading Rene Marans “Batouala”
All night we danced upon our windy hill,
Your dress a cloud of tangled midnight hair,
And love was much too much for me to wear
My leaves; the killer roared above his kill,
But you danced on, and when some star would spill
Its red and white upon you whirling there,
I sensed a hidden beauty in the air;
Though you danced on, my heart and I stood still.
But suddenly a bit of morning crept
Along your trembling sides of ebony;
I saw the tears your tired limbs had wept,
And how your breasts heaved high, how languidly
Your dark arms moved; I drew you close to me;
We flung ourselves upon our hill and slept."
Saturday's Child,"Some are teethed on a silver spoon,
    With the stars strung for a rattle;
I cut my teeth as the black raccoon—
    For implements of battle.
Some are swaddled in silk and down,
    And heralded by a star;
They swathed my limbs in a sackcloth gown
    On a night that was black as tar.
For some, godfather and goddame
    The opulent fairies be;
Dame Poverty gave me my name,
    And Pain godfathered me.
For I was born on Saturday—
    ""Bad time for planting a seed,""
Was all my father had to say,
    And, ""One mouth more to feed.""
Death cut the strings that gave me life,
    And handed me to Sorrow,
The only kind of middle wife
    My folks could beg or borrow."
Two Who Crossed a Line,"(He Crosses)
He rode across like a cavalier,
    Spurs clicking hard and loud;
And where he tarried dropped his tear
    On heads he left low-bowed.
But, ""Even Stephen,"" he cried, and struck
    His steed an urgent blow;
He swore by youth he was a buck
    With savage oats to sow.
To even up some standing scores,
    From every flower bed
He passed, he plucked by threes and fours
    Till wheels whirled in his head.
But long before the drug could tell,
    He took his anodyne;
With scornful grace, he bowed farewell
    And retraversed the line."
Cause of Death,"These are times when judicial proceedings would do well to include a linguist, a forensic linguist...
            —El País, Catalan Edition, 27 March 2018
A foreigner, I walk Barcelona breathless, marveling
at files of school children laughing, chatting as teachers
shepherd them in Catalan, at street signs in the same
language, at elderly men and elderly women on benches
or peering down from balconies, once shamed or worse
for speaking this, their heart language, gossiping now
in short words ending in plosives, in fricative zh´s
and sh´s not found in Spanish,
all in my lifetime, and I think how
language is fragile, how a breath
could leave a sentence and not return,
because this morning I scrolled down the news,
past the headlines of politicians imprisoned,
of the ex-president detained, no violence needed,
behind him the bloody wipe of fingers
on the gold shield that is the Catalan flag,
scrolled past the photos of multitudes in the streets,
on the highways, the students, the grandmothers,
the professionals, of baton-swinging police,
down to the bottom, to the story of the last
professor of Phoenician language in Spain.
She’s 67, has taught at the University of Barcelona
for 43 years, since Franco died. Phoenicians
settled the coast of Catalonia, wrote early pages
of the Catalan story, and when she retires,
their words will dissipate back out to sea.
An empty desk the final straw,
but where does the death of a language begin?
            A law?              A jail?               A baton?
When I began Catalan, I didn’t know
learning a language is a political act.
How can I not be changed once I'm able to speak
of rauxa and seny, words of Catalan character,
no equivalent in the language of Cervantes,
of my Southern mother, my Midwestern father?
Maybe I had always been waiting
to hear these words, waiting since Casals´
cello sang Bach to me, waiting since, as a child,
Dali shocked me, The Persistence of Memory,
not knowing those golden cliffs were the coast
of Catalonia, not knowing the other language,
before art, before sonatas or oils, was Catalan.
Who is waiting today, waiting without knowing
they are waiting, to hear a word in Phoenician,
a word now lost forever, drifted back to sea?"
Excerpts from “Duned”,"The worst work of my hands is in English—: I’m a chiral body writing into what I cannot coincide. 
I’ve come to the mountain to bless these hands back. Clay clod & gypsum—: a way my body has been & will become. I rename one hand Occupied Territory, call to the other Amante Verde. & the mountain sobs its hornblende to the surface. 
I am known in this place—: of Creation & cascabel. Mojave Greens are my relatives. I holograph in the ambient heat, green quicked with copper. Don’t play with snakes they say Don’t play with your own power.
Beneath the granite boulders the hibernaculum cools, empty with shed skins—: their spectered shells, curled ribbons of fried light.  
The pressure of molecule & memory—: atmosphere bears touch on loop, apparates everything it has held. The salted swastiks of their bodies, thick, rope-heavy, a scent you have to lift. 
My flesh-light cleaves their old energy eyes, slips each slit of limonite & aperture. In them I am struck—: a fever image. They coil into their handless work of transmutation, into radio sensation, rattling the hair on my forearms. 
She recognizes me not as human but as her own imagination. I am granite reorganized, a formation—: yet forming. I dream with the mountain because I am of the mountain.
Grief for my elemental life respires my body. My snakes lick me from the wind like a chemical, return me to electric signal—: a web of small lightning suturing the mouth to the skull. Pleasure, unlanguaged & noise.
I was dreamed into being—: I was the dreamer. Skin fleshes the world it’s made of, in overwhelm. 
Cloud shadow drifts a gray whale across the salt flats—: a periphery of white halite crust surrounds its slow shade. My lover crystallizes this same way along the ridges of my knuckles & back of my hand, the dorsal side, as we also call a fin—: I surfaced from deep submersion. 
There is no pleasure not earthen or wet. Ancient ocean, we say—: & we mean every body.
Sand’s gentle crust of berm edging the wash—: the desert a hot pie, juiceless yet swelling mirage. The neon red sign of a jackrabbit’s spine eaten to its glow, dropped from the sky, flickers in the bleach-light gushing the open land.
How much love can a desert drink to bone? How many bodies—: pressed beneath this tectonic pie?
A shelled vehicle in landscape—: rust-burning, slow bleed of oxide having laced the chassis, licked the light bucket to chrome edges. 
A ram’s scattered skeleton—: empty lake of pelvis, desert grapevines threading the bone sockets, tugging the jaw vee deeper into the canyon. Its broken horn is a curl of gold telephone I hold to my eye. I am dislocated. Some knowledge is not mine, some is but I haven’t arrived there yet. 
A long time ago the wind licked the coyote’s skull to glass—: this is how we happen. Atom-born, I bend back the atom world. My inheritance is hydrogen. How rain & clouds happen to one another—: wet though risen up from dust, abundant. 
We have no word for God. It is sky because someone said it was. Until then, it was only what was in it: giant fish with pharyngeal teeth, orange sand clouds, & ‘Amo—: the bighorn sheep made of stars & staggered, spear still warm from the warrior’s hand, 
its shattered torso notching the night. The first wound was a clock, our hunger. We ate the mountain sheep—: now our moon is a curve of cold fat congealing on a blued bone & lives in daylight, diurnal leftover.
Over night’s black dunes we follow the trail of ‘Amo’s white face. If I speak of love—: who will believe me? The only poets in this desert are beryl & jasper. 
Thunder is not thunder but the air broken by lighting. My lover backlit like a thunderhead, strapped with night until the softness of her hips disrupts—: her light-wet hands & cock. I am the sound I make breaking in a room. 
We are always becoming—: from somewhere. Desire is a blood-colored worm flexing the sand sea around me. I have a power I am learning to be careful with.
They say When you see Numet, she’s already been watching you. The stroke her long tail drags in the sand disappears where the loose wash turns granite outcrop. Looning & lonely, I thundercat—: stalk myself through wind-flooded canyons, watch myself happen to me in the map of my hand. 
In the beginning we didn’t understand the bullet. It had no head, no arms or legs—: Menamentk we said. It crossed the water. We named it ‘Anya kwa’oorny. We named it Of the Sun. We had no word for shore, except how water touches land.  
They gave us the word shore for their bullet to arrive on. Then said our flesh was also Shore—: so we called the bullet Bullet. We name things for what is done there.
The injuries of becoming human. Tuu’achk—: shoulder blades from turtle shell, hand from wing. The carpus erupting petals of wrist—: bone-flower, flesh.
Bats ripen like fruit in the lava fields, in volcanic caves of basalt. Dusk buds their breathing wings—: flowering angel-beasts. The bats remember when we loved ourselves & called so tenderly into twilight that our words brought us the throbbing world—: mosquito & blood. Kenakenem. 
Even the eye’s small water will evaporate to quench the sun. I search the rain from the tongues of my skin—: it is four months away. 
The horse has been dead in the dunes all summer. Sun-chromed ravens in early devotion opened each bright window along its bloated belly—: unthreaded red curtains. 
Desert as Plutonian shore—: the torso open, a sand-torn sail of hide flapping above the funeral boat. In Mojave a horse is what it does & how it does it, but our word for boat is a wooden box. 
Mesquite pods drip in light from turquoise branches. Coyotes mistake the pool for moon water. If the shepherds don’t poison the coyotes—: the coyotes will eat the pods & scat them out. 
Scarification—: the obligation of breaking, of rock & whelm.
Every scar loses its wound. In the valley of loss I shift shape, an ache—: become one hundred coyotes in the ‘analy grove weeping from every fleshed door of my body.
The land of Death is a duned land. Xeric. Saly’aay. Saly’aat. We burn our dead we say—: because we do. Touch me I say, because it’s a story we become."
After the Winter Rain,"After the winter rain, 
   Sing, robin! Sing, swallow!
Grasses are in the lane, 
   Buds and flowers will follow.
Woods shall ring, blithe and gay,
   With bird-trill and twitter,
Though the skies weep to-day, 
   And the winds are bitter. 
Though deep call unto deep
   As calls the thunder, 
And white the billows leap
   The tempest under;
Softly the waves shall come
   Up the long, bright beaches, 
With dainty, flowers of foam
   And tenderest speeches…
After the wintry pain, 
   And the long, long sorrow, 
Sing, heart!—for thee again
   Joy comes with the morrow."

Radium Dream,"We come at the wrong time of year by a hair
or a week, and the brown birds flying onward,
out of reach. My son tilts his head. A minor star-
burst of cranes lights the far corner of
the sky—stragglers, fewer than expected,
but enough to glitter the air with strangeness—
these birds with their necks not tucked in, forming
their odd cries. When they land by the shore,
their toothpick legs appear hardly enough
to hold up their robust bodies. Often
I think—“That's not really happening is it?” as though I
were acting in a film or a vision of a life. On the
highway, they warn us not to drink—too much
uranium, leached down from the abandoned mines.
The cranes twist their necks to stab the quick-
light of fish. Do cranes know how to
swim? And why is swimming so different than flying?
Now, aloft again, they apparate with uncanny
quickness into cloud. How does the eye lose
them—is it how high they rise? The bones
in my son’s hand, they tell me, have stopped growing
too early. They act like this is a problem, but I
have radium dreams—a brightness: Him, me, you, the
cranes, and in them nothing dies."
Wind,"The wind was a care-free soul 
    That broke the chains of earth, 
And strode for a moment across the land
    With the wild halloo of his mirth.
He little cared that he ripped up trees, 
    That houses fell at his hand, 
That his step broke calm on the breast of seas, 
    That his feet stirred clouds of sand. 
But when he had had his little joke, 
    Had shouted and laughed and sung, 
When the trees were scarred, their branches broke, 
    And their foliage aching hung, 
He crept to his cave with a stealthy tread, 
    With rain-filled eyes and low-bowed head."
Two Who Crossed a Line,"(She Crosses)
From where she stood the air she craved
    Smote with the smell of pine;
It was too much to bear; she braved
    Her gods and crossed the line.
And we were hurt to see her go,
    With her fair face and hair,
And veins too thin and blue to show
    What mingled blood flowed there.
We envied her a while, who still
    Pursued the hated track;
Then we forgot her name, until
    One day her shade came back.
Calm as a wave without a crest,
    Sorrow-proud and sorrow-wise,
With trouble sucking at her breast,
    With tear-disdainful eyes,
She slipped into her ancient place,
    And, no word asked, gave none;
Only the silence in her face
    Said seats were dear in the sun."
Simon the Cyrenian Speaks,"He never spoke a word to me,
    And yet He called my name;
He never gave a sign to me,
    And yet I knew and came.
At first I said, ""I will not bear
    His cross upon my back;
He only seeks to place it there
    Because my skin is black.""
But He was dying for a dream,
    And He was very meek,
And in His eyes there shone a gleam
    Men journey far to seek.
It was Himself my pity bought;
    I did for Christ alone
What all of Rome could not have wrought
    With bruise of lash or stone."
Harlem Wine,"This is not water running here,
    These thick rebellious streams
That hurtle flesh and bone past fear
    Down alleyways of dreams.
This is a wine that must flow on
    Not caring how nor where,
So it has ways to flow upon
    Where song is in the air.
So it can woo an artful flute
    With loose, elastic lips,
Its measurement of joy compute
    With blithe, ecstatic hips."
Tableau,"For Donald Duff
Locked arm in arm they cross the way,
    The black boy and the white,
The golden splendor of the day,
    The sable pride of night.
From lowered blinds the dark folk stare,
    And here the fair folk talk,
Indignant that these two should dare
    In unison to walk.
Oblivious to look and word
    They pass, and see no wonder
That lightning brilliant as a sword
    Should blaze the path of thunder."
Near White,"Ambiguous of race they stand,
    By one disowned, scorned of another,
Not knowing where to stretch a hand,
    And cry, “My sister” or “My brother.”"
Atlantic City Waiter,"With subtle poise he grips his tray
    Of delicate things to eat;
Choice viands to their mouths half way,
    The ladies watch his feet
Go carving dexterous avenues
    Through sly intricacies;
Ten thousand years on jungle clues
    Alone shaped feet like these.
For him to be humble who is proud
    Needs colder artifice;
Though half his pride is disavowed,
    In vain the sacrifice.
Sheer through his acquiescent mask
    Of bland gentility,
The jungle flames like a copper cask
    Set where the sun strikes free."
Black Magdalens,"These have no Christ to spit and stoop
    To write upon the sand,
Inviting him that has not sinned
    To raise the first rude hand.
And if he came they could not buy
    Rich ointment for his feet,
The body’s sale scarce yields enough
    To let the body eat.
The chaste clean ladies pass them by
    And draw their skirts aside,
But Magdalens have a ready laugh;
    They wrap their wounds in pride.
They fare full ill since Christ forsook
    The cross to mount a throne,
And Virtue still is stooping down
    To cast the first hard stone."
To A Brown Boy,"That brown girl’s swagger gives a twitch
    To beauty like a queen;
Lad, never dam your body’s itch
    When loveliness is seen.
For there is ample room for bliss
    In pride in clean, brown limbs,
And lips know better how to kiss
    Than how to raise white hymns.
And when your body’s death gives birth
    To soil for spring to crown,
Men will not ask if that rare earth
    Was white flesh once, or brown."
To A Brown Girl,"(For Roberta)
What if his glance is bold and free,
    His mouth the lash of whips?
So should the eyes of lovers be,
    And so a lover's lips.
What if no puritanic strain
    Confines him to the nice?
He will not pass this way again,
    Nor hunger for you twice.
Since in the end consort together
    Magdalen and Mary,
Youth is the time for careless weather:
    Later, lass, be wary."
Brown Boy to Brown Girl,"(Remembrance on a hill) (For Yolande)
“As surely as I hold your hand in mine,
As surely as your crinkled hair belies
The enamoured sun pretending that he dies
While still he loiters in its glossy shine,
As surely as I break the slender line
That spider linked us with, in no least wise
Am I uncertain that these alien skies
Do not our whole life measure and confine.
No less, once in a land of scarlet suns
And brooding winds, before the hurricane
Bore down upon us, long before this pain,
We found a place where quiet water runs;
I held your hand this way upon a hill,
And felt my heart forebear, my pulse grow still."""
A Brown Girl Dead,"With two white roses on her breasts,
    White candles at head and feet,
Dark Madonna of the grave she rests;
    Lord Death has found her sweet.
Her mother pawned her wedding ring
    To lay her out in white;
She'd be so proud she'd dance and sing
    To see herself tonight."
Custody,"Chopping cilantro and flat leaf parsley
on a bamboo board at the sink, mincing
garlic and onions. Late mellowing light,
the air bordering on cool but tinged
bitter-green with the smell of growing
amargoso in the yard. I can keep
the kitchen door open because the side gate
is locked, and the week-long siege at the street
corner is over. We did not know the man
they say trespassed, early Monday morning,
into someone's yard with a firearm;
did not know what altercation if any
led to someone calling the police. So he ran
and barricaded himself in his own house.
They came in force, then; rifles drawn,
sealed off one end of the block. Those of us
who could still come and go out the other end
brought back reports every day, over four
days: how many squad cars, where the waiting
ambulance was parked, the bomb unit; who saw
the robot deployed with a phone, the negotiators,
the TV crew. We did not witness how, before dawn
on the fourth day, finally they took him into custody—
from the Latin custodia meaning guardianship,
keeping, care. Now this man who neighbors say
used to pelt their doors with donuts, or attach
stuffed animals on leashes for walks,
is in a hospital or facility. Is it wrong  
to wonder if it lasted as long as it did
instead of arriving at swifter resolution—
doors broken in; tasers, clubs; bullets sprayed
into his body—because of the color of his skin?
Or is it possible to believe that finally
something of change might be moving slowly
through the dismal atmosphere, tempering
and holding in check, allowing the thought
to stay the trigger, the heart to register
its trembling before letting the weapon fly?
In summer, because dark descends more slowly,
it's hard to scan the sky for the hunter
and his belt studded with the three telltale
bright stars; harder to remember how
once, he boasted he would hunt down and kill
all of earth's wild animals, to make it safe.
But there he is, adrift in the inky darkness,
club and shield eternally raised, his own K-9 units
at his heels; and here we are, still trying to sort
villain from victim, wound from welcome opening."
Berlin: 28.6.2019,"The westerly wind blows across a patch of desert outside my apartment window facing north: the Deutschland Radio, the ever-spinning ring of Mercedes Benz, and the metal fences set up for the construction of new housing. Only the fences remind me of home—the endless barbed wire across the waist of a nation. A cooler temperature expected this morning before the heat wave arrives in a day. On 28.6.1950, in Seoul, three days after the war had begun, my father washed his face and looked up at the stars on a clear night, then decided to head out to the city center. The photos of the war had yet to appear in the nation’s newspapers. No one was on the road. The East Gate was still standing, but the police station was empty. The tracks shone under the stars but there were no trams to be seen. I merely merrily washed my face and looked out to the ring of Benz lit at dawn, and finally caught a strand of remote signal from my father. V6. V frequently stands for violence and virtue. An understatement, perhaps. I didn’t know what to make of 6, except that 6 persists as June, and that it comes after number five, which has been discreetly established as 5=O in a glossary of translingual puns. As my father did seventy years ago to his unborn daughter, I channeled onto the most remote canyons of the desert—Are you OK, ROK? I’m childless, so I have no choice but to channel onto the desert of memory.
In my future city of two Koreas, I began reliving the acute feelings of separation from home. I would shake them off by midmorning, by pacing in my spacious apartment, then they’d return again the following day. The incessant chirping of the sparrows perched on tall birch trees outside my balcony only heightened my grief. This inexplicable ailment, which began in Hong Kong when we left South Korea during the dictatorship, had magnified over the years, then it had somewhat subsided as I settled, often numbing myself with work involving translation after translation. The unexpected return of my childhood grief prompted me to search for the remote waves of my father, my other universe. The ring of Benz was a radar of some sort. Like a compass, it operated magnetically and, not surprisingly, it also had tremendous capacity for sonic sensitivity. It didn’t take me long to detect the exact location. I spotted my father on a bridge, once again. This time he was standing on Glienicker Brücke, between Berlin and Potsdam. The fate of Korea’s waist was decided at the 1945 Potsdam Convention, by Churchill, Stalin, and Truman. From where I stand, facing north, the geopolitics of division have long been eroded by incessant wind, vanished or buried beneath the sand. Korea’s waist remains fatefully inconsequential. My father waved to me across a vast distance, from his present dimension: We are still not OK!"
Ex(ile),"We ask about our people and they tell us the plight of boats
yachts smashed in the marina, ferries crashed into harbors
masts snapped, propellers bent, vessels drowned in coves.
They broadcast reports of water rising in hotel rooms
sand slipping into sheets where our cousins could never sleep  
salt stains as testimony, spit-prints of the hurricane’s wrath.
Bodies are piling up in the morgues and instead
an elegy of boats
an inventory of industry, countdown
to when paradise can begin again.
So it seems when we’re no longer property
we become less than property
a nail sick with rust, jangling in high winds.
This would be a different story were it not
for ex(ile), whose sting swells when banished
in one’s own yard, barred
from the fruits of your mother’s land.
Inside ex(ile): tempests and fault lines
are developers’ wet dreams.
A mainland will sink its territory in debt
starve its subjects in the wake of storms
clearing ground for palaces on the shore.
Inside ex(ile): the body is only
as good as its technology
how it buckles in a field.
Inside ex(ile) is the ile
pushed across the Atlantic through Oya’s lips.
Place or shelter, sacred home.
We ask about our people and fill the silence with prayer
utterances rerouting to our climate’s first spirits:
Guabancex blowing furious winds, Huraca’n spiraling at the center.
Guatauba drenched in thunder and lightning.
Coatrisque of the deadly floods.
Spare our kin, we plead. Save your wrath for the profiteers.
Cast them from our archipelago, our ile ife of the seas
until home is a place we never have to leave."

23 Reasons Why Mexicanos Can Still Be Found in a Walmart,"after Juan Felipe Herrera’s “187 Reasons Why Mexicanos Can’t Cross the Border”
con amor para los 23 del 3 de agosto del 2019/with love for the 23 of August 3, 2019.
Because we will still travel for a Walmart weekend in gringolandia.
Because we will still buy Bic pens in bulk so they last our children until they’re 21.
Because we will still recognize that 7-Eleven gas lasts longer than Pemex.
Because we will still smile when a dog sniffs our bags, troca or traseros.
Because we will still sweat into our shoes, jeans, eyes to climb the bridge and say “American.”  
Because we will still pack Sabritas, Bonafont, and bedpan in our cars to wait in line for hours to show our green card.
Because we will still cross to Juárez to get tacos, tortas and steaks for the best taste and price.
Because we will still lick our fingers before grabbing the wheel to drive back to El Paso.
Because we will still have a love/hate relationship with I-10, the kilometers turning into miles.
Because we will still whisper paciencia when Chuco people signal right but don’t, in fact, exit on Hawkins to get to Walmart.
Because we will still fundraise for our daughter’s fútbol team under this sun.
Because we will still think maldita sea when we see the Equate brand of Gain is out.
Because we will still scoff at the price of avocados and think esto no puede ser aguacate Hass.
Because we will still think we’re beating the Orange Man by knowing where to buy what.
[Because we are beating him. We’re la frontera, the border, no one looks or does it like us!]
Because we will still say thank you and gracias or thankyou-gracias to the cashier.
Because we will still be as warm as August, the warmest-turned-coldest month.
Because we will still give our backs to bullets so our children and spouses don’t die.
Because we will still feel 23 lives in our necks’ cuero enchinado but stay free; no prison or suicide watch.
Because we will still leave our screen, wood and metal doors open. To anyone.
Because we will still walk while brown in a Walmart (or Target, Sam’s, or Ross) and walk tall.
Because why not? Because heart. Because God. Because Mighty Mexican Super Ratón. Because human.

Dear Beth,"translated by Sasha Pimentel
The girls in Perth Amboy
add to the wind
their small tears
to loosen the torment.
I remember 
the first time
on these grounds,
the mailbox, the snow,
your coupon book,
English class,
the smell of neglect
in the hallways.
So,
Winter,
the liminal sickness
of sidewalks.
The cold
at the corners of lips,
above the machines,
the counter
and vital signs,
Cold
intervening
the deep root of rage,
sowing what is solid
into the lawn,
heightening the rose’s stem,
and from your own kindness.
But I think,
dear Beth,
it must be true
that before us
was another tribe of wanderers,
shepherds of loss
these girls
in Perth Amboy
shaking the bedsheet,
cursing the weather,
their many errands,
and climbing regularly
the erect hill
of ire,
our
daily goddess,
the first language
we learned here,
our great, unexpected possession.
I ask myself
dear Beth,
is this bright, 
hard, polished stone of rage
the land that we were promised?
  Querida Beth
  Las muchachas en Perth Amboy
agregan al viento
sus minúsculas lágrimas
para desatar la tormenta.
Recuerdo,
la primera vez de todo
en este predio:
el buzón, la nieve
tu libro de cupones
la clase de inglés,
el olor a desamparo
en los pasillos.
Entonces 
el Invierno,
la enfermedad liminal 
de las aceras.
El frío,
en la comisura de los labios,
arriba de las máquinas,
del mostrador
y de los signos vitales,
El frío 
interviniendo
La raíz profunda de la rabia,
sembrando lo sólido en la grama
arreciando el tallo de la rosa
y de tu propia bondad.
Pero pienso, 
querida Beth,
que debe ser cierto 
que antes de nosotras
hubo otra peregrina tribu 
pastora de la pérdida
esas muchachas 
en Perth Amboy
sacudiendo la sábana
desdiciendo del clima,
de sus muchos oficios 
y subiendo regularmente 
la colina erguida
de la ira,
nuestra 
diosa matutina, 
la primera lengua que 
aprendimos aquí, 
nuestra gran posesión inesperada.
Yo me pregunto
querida Beth 
¿es esta recia
lustrosa piedra pulida de la rabia 
la tierra que nos prometieron?"
Advice for Using Blood in a Poem,"If someone suggests you use words besides
blood in your poems, make it part of a recipe
Try dinuguan, for example
Make your blood impossible to avoid
Another name for this dish is chocolate
meat, the name your aunts used to hide
from you the fact you were eating 
pork blood with your rice
Other ingredients may include garlic, onions,
liver, pork belly, dried bay leaf, 
vinegar, chicken stock, etc.
Say you know the difference between blood and sweetness
Say you hate the taste of liver
Think of the blood in your poem as a lie
Say this is also your blood: the Spanish 
explorer Miguel Lopez de Legazpi and the Datu
Sikatuna, who poured blood from their left 
arms into the same cup, mixed it 
with wine before drinking
Make a sculpture for the promises you have made
with blood that belonged to someone else
Put it on an island you have never visited
and encourage others to see it
Dream about a volcano and an earthquake, 
about the gunfire the day they carried 
your grandfather to the cemetery after
he cracked his skull on the bathroom floor, 
about the hair of your parents sticky 
with blood, the glass beneath their skin, 
the scabs on their lips
When you came to retrieve 
their luggage, their sandy fishing gear 
from the wreckage of their car, you found
the bloodstains on the exposed air bags, 
the dashboard, the jacket wet 
with rainwater wedged between the seats
Consider the insects that gathered around
all the blood you would not touch
Count the number of times 
this blood appears
When you close your eyes, what is
the color of your blood?
No cheating"
Blood and Bones,"In California, someone is found hanging
from a tree, and no one knows why;
in my anger, I forget to explain
to our white neighbor, why it matters
that he’s black,
if only she knew
the luxury of not having to worry
whether her life mattered or not–
*
The first time I learned
about the color of my skin
I spent months
crossing a border
where my kind was not welcomed;
the first time I was othered
I was still in the womb
breaking in my naming–
*
In California, a man is found hanging
from a tree, and no one knows why;
someone said,
            it must have been a suicide,
what country is this
where suicide becomes the hopeful thing–
I want to talk about this,
I say to my husband,
do you know what this means?
I have run out of ways
of telling him that he, too, is a black, black man
living in a white, white world
but his body knows
our bodies always know–
*
In California, a black man is found hanging
from a tree, and no one knows why;
when they hear the news, someone asks
what kind of tree,
what country is this
where life is not life if it inhabits a black body
where we have to march in the streets
and get beaten, gassed, hunted down
so someone, anyone, can see this,
this us we see, this us we are, this humanness.
*
I am filled with a quiet furor. What happens
when the body is marked before it is born,
what happens to it
when it is filled with grief
what happens
when no one sees it as such
what happens
to black bodies riddled with war
what war is this
that continues to kill, kill, kill.
*
In California, a black man is found hanging
from a tree, and someone knows why;
we want to say many things
but none seem to get through;
our mother’s grief
is too great to contain us,
too deep to keep us safe
what do you call a country
that kills its people
and calls itself free,
what freedom is this
that has us running
that holds us hostage
that invades our every being
that hunts our children
that takes our fathers
that murders, murders, murders
Stop–
            listen to this:
In California, a black man is found hanging
from a tree, do you know why?
Does it matter
what kind of tree it was, what kind of earth
housed the roots of such tree,
does it matter
whether the man was in his early twenties
with glimmering black skin
and dancing dreadlocks
would you feel better
if it was a suicide
would it be better
if you never heard about this
do you find yourself thinking,
who would do such a thing,
do you find yourself breaking
completely split open
and parts of you erupting out,
did you wonder
about his mother
about her grief
about his beloveds
did you tell yourself
something nice
to forget this hanging body
did you will it away
what else did you do
to let yourself forget
as you did with all the others
did you tell yourself
I would never–but wait, wait:
did you hear:
in California, a black man is found hanging
from a tree, and you know why;
there is nothing more to say
no further reasoning you need to do
no way out of this,
listen closely:
a black man
is found hanging
from a tree
I know you must like trees
these tall muscular giants
housing small fruits,
breathing, living things,
I know you must think
this is a horrific thing
that has happened to a black man
but how many trees
have housed black bodies
how many were complicit
in our collective dying,
how quick are we to forget
the marred history of this land
built on the blood and bones
of our ancestors
how many more
will need to die
until you see, see, see
how many more
gunned down, beaten, suffocated
until you hear
our rightful pleading
how much blood
must you have on your hands
before our children
are finally set free,
listen:
a black man
hangs from a tree
a black man
hangs
from a tree
a black man
hanging from a tree,
how dare you try and absolve yourself
from our collective lynching–"
Soulwork,"One’s is to feed. One’s is to cleave.
One’s to be doubled over under greed.
One’s is strife. One’s to be strangled by life.
One’s to be called and to rise.
One’s to stare fire in the eye.
One’s is bondage to pleasure.
One’s to be held captive by power.
One’s to drive a nation to its naked knees
in war. One’s is the rapture of stolen hours.
One’s to be called yet cower.
One’s is to defend the dead.
One’s to suffer until ego is shed.
One’s is to dribble the nectar of evil.
One’s but to roll a stone up a hill.
One’s to crouch low
over damp kindling in deep snow
coaxing the thin plume
of cautious smoke.
One’s is only to shiver.
One’s is only to blow."
If You Knew,"If you could know the empty ache of loneliness,
          Masked well behind the calm indifferent face
Of us who pass you by in studied hurriedness,
          Intent upon our way, lest in the little space
Of one forgetful moment hungry eyes implore
          You to be kind, to open up your heart a little more,
I’m sure you’d smile a little kindlier, sometimes,
          To those of us you’ve never seen before.
If you could know the eagerness we’d grasp
          The hand you’d give to us in friendliness;
What vast, potential friendship in that clasp
          We’d press, and love you for your gentleness;
If you could know the wide, wide reach
          Of love that simple friendliness could teach,
I’m sure you’d say “Hello, my friend,” sometimes, 
          And now and then extend a hand in friendliness to each."
Torch,"The old man cruises our neighborhood
in a 2-tone Chevy built like a fort;
he offers 25 cents to the girls
who’ll come close enough to let him pinch
a cheek—gaze hidden behind dark
glasses, one hand on the wheel,
one eye on the rearview mirror.
Across the street, we dare
each other: you do it; no,
you do it—pulled as much by the glory
of what a whole quarter buys,
by the yearning to be wanted
by someone—we’re just trailer court kids
on a Saturday morning made of asphalt,
shaggy pines and rain. Our mothers
chain smoke Pall Malls inside thin walls,
fathers or stepfathers or mothers’ boyfriends
out hunting work or already drinking.
We’ve all spent nights waiting outside The Mecca
in our parents’ old cars, peering over back seats
into dark windows as if wishing
could erase those light-years of distance.
I am a hungry heart on skinny legs,
standing on the edge of a journey—
no maps, no guides, instincts muddled
by neglect or abandonment or mistake;
naked, letting other people dress me
in trust, shame, lust. I want to say
I will learn how to hide my longing—
that invisible sign scrawled on my forehead
like an SOS revealing my location to the enemy—
but the truth is something more like this:
If there is a patron saint of trailer courts,
if Our Lady of the Single-Wide watches over
potholed streets, crew-cut bullies,
stolen bikes and wildflower ditches, if
children learn to brandish scabs and scars
like medals; if a prayer exists to banish predators—
well, no one taught me that magic.
So I step into that road, cross that street,
take that bribe—and keep walking, out
of that trailer park, away from that childhood.
I follow my hunger, my emptiness, the flame
on my forehead not betrayal but reminder:
it’s not wrong to want, to ask—not wrong—
I keep the beacon lit so love might see me."
Aubade at the City of Change,"In this city
each door I cross
in search of your room
grows darker
than the sky, this silver
dome of morning spread
across the urban smog.
Country dark washes the city
light off the outskirts
& beyond
where you sleep in hiding,
where your face
wrapped in gauze
shines like sequin
in the lingering moon-drizzle.
I reach for you
at the corners of the clubs,
inside motel rooms,
where rent boys tumble
perspired bed sheets,
doubling you, your maleness
discharged,
your hipbones sticking
to my thighs, hard
stubble of your legs
scratching. The night I followed
a strange road, looking
to forget all this, starlight
spooled the gravel ribbon
leading back to the city
behind me, back
to the hospital room
where I last saw you—
Tonight, I’ll rest
on this road, I’ll look back
to the city of change
where one year
two skyscrapers lifted, a park
shed trees
for new thoroughfares,
& an old cinema
erupted to rebuild itself
in its place. I’ll stay
on the pavement,
suspended in time
like the broken sign announcing
You are entering
, (a name
changed two years ago),
& I’ll wonder
if the hot breeze
blowing the nape
of my neck
is your unchanged
breath rising like candle
smoke from the city."
Thought.,"A swift, successive chain of things,
That flash, kaleidoscope-like, now in, now out,
Now straight, now eddying in wild rings,
No order, neither law, compels their moves,
But endless, constant, always swiftly roves."
"1967, Girl and Snow","On nights like this, she sleeps with the car’s jack handle
            in her hand, the smell of oil and metal oddly comforting
in such a public place. She keeps her clothes
in a cardboard box on the ’54 Chevy’s back seat,
            along with a green wool blanket, two towels, a bag
of books. And tonight she piles blouses, blue jeans,
sweater, skirt—all of it—on top of her body, hunkering
            down low on the front seat. She’s parked beneath
the brightest overhanging street light she could find
at the edge of this shopping mall parking lot, slammed
            the door locks down tight. Tomorrow, she’ll drive
across town, tell a pack of lies to a do-gooder doctor.
She’ll lie about her name, her address, her age—
            she’ll invent a husband. After the impossible
calendar questions, the awkward, back-opening
gown, the cold feet in iron stirrups, the knees
            spreading, the gloved hand pressing, the fingers
probing—the earnest-faced doctor will tell her
(while pulling gloves off, while tossing them
            into a gray metal bin), will tell her: yes. A baby
is arriving in late August—as if
she should expect a visitor, maybe stepping off
            the Greyhound bus, suitcase in hand—
and she remembers how her grandmother would call
her period the unwelcome visitor, how she’d say
            the only thing worse than the monthly visitor
is no visitor at all. The doctor will say everything
looks fine. He’ll say No charge for today. He’ll smile a little,
            shake her hand. The best he can do.
Then he’ll leave her alone in that white, white room
and she’ll button up her wrinkled work uniform, slip out
            onto the street, and make her way back
to the shopping mall to work the snack bar’s sorry
evening shift, serving coffee, burgers and fries to bored
            store clerks and tired housewives. Soon, like everyone else,
her high school principal will notice the swelling arc
of her belly, and he’ll call her into his windowless office,
            sit her down on a metal chair, and recite
district policy excluding pregnant students
from attending school. He will insist
            it’s for her own good. The girl will say he’s wrong.
She’ll say she’s not pregnant at all. He’ll call in
the kind, freckled woman who teaches history, and the girl
            will deny it again. She’ll deny it
over and over—to all of them—determined to hold them off
until graduation in June. Spring will be long, and filled with rain.
            But tonight, large flakes of snow hover in the light
and she thinks of her mother, scrambling toward the promise
of a job—her mother and the five younger kids, sleeping
            600 miles away on the floor of a rented house in a warm
desert town this girl has never seen, and she starts the car, lets it run
a few minutes with heater on and the urgency
            of Grace Slick’s “Somebody to Love” on the radio,
and she pulls the blanket close around her shoulders, imagines
the dense, pressed asphalt under the car, and the ancient
            earth beneath the asphalt, and she watches
the snow grow heavy, pile up, darkening."
Prologue to a Womanhood,"Because dirt, my uncle called,
wore my human face,
into the window
of the abandoned home
where the boy and I
beetled miscible, like a trick,
through the teeming dark.
Because I bared my spine,
its soft gnarls,
for his fingers’ drizzle
to stir
and pry away the alarm
a woman comes
to know is her body.
Because in dining rooms,
aunties gathered to unscramble ayahs
and surveille immaculate windows
for unscarved girls,
their ringed forefingers
always heady with blame.
Because I hastened, a flash,
a mistake of speed.
And no matter how many times
I summoned foot to foot
for the untimely symmetry
of prayer, night after night,
swarming like locusts,
gregarious as Armageddon,
came the apparitions: my uncle,
siphoned forth in the antiseptic light,
watching the boy and I,
like a sore expelled from the center.
Because how easily I believed him,
smothered for months
that dark room beneath
the arsenic trail of my own
isolate fault and heaps
of pistachio ice cream
I dolloped all over
my sedentary, my criminal thighs."
The Moons of Neptune,"Triton
I bet my body for my body. My sex becomes medical waste.
Somewhere an insurance agent checks the paperwork.
Purple orchids, yellow orchids, gifts.
A machine vacuums blood from the surgical site.
When the chaplain discreetly comes out to me, I confess.
I ask the nurse on the night shift, “Is that the Moon?”
The night before, my mother texted “Sorry, no.”
I blocked her number. I told only one of my blood sisters.
When asked what I wanted for breakfast, I said rice.
I used a spirometer to keep my lungs from collapsing.
I regretted not meditating with the chaplain.
I was told no. I was told no. No one stayed but nurses.
My surgeon loved how the flowers grew.
Summer had passed and I bore a new weight."
My Loves,"I love to see the big white moon, 
  A-shining in the sky;
I love to see the little stars, 
  When the shadow clouds go by.
I love the rain drops falling
  On my roof-top in the night;
I love the soft wind’s sighing, 
  Before the dawn’s gray light.
I love the deepness of the blue, 
  In my Lord’s heaven above; 
But better than all these things I think, 
  I love my lady love."
Skin Tight,"The internal organs were growling
According to them
They did all of the work while
Skin got all of the attention
He’s an organ just like us
They groused
Even the heart, which, a
Century ago, was the Queen
Of metaphors, but now
Was reduced to the greetings
Cards section of CVS,
Chimed in
They decided to call skin
On the carpet.
Skin arrived from Cannes
Where he’d been the subject
Of much fuss as actresses
Fed him luxurious skin
Food prepared by Max Factor
Estée Lauder, L’Oreal,
And Chanel
They
Caressed him daily
Sometimes for hours before
They made the red carpet
Shine
He was petted
And preened
Others
Pleaded with him
To erase wrinkles to
Make them look younger
To tighten their chins
Skin tried to appease the
Critics, greeting them with
His familiar “give me some skin”
But his gesture went unheeded
Brain did all the talking
Brain said, “Here’s the skinny
Why do you get
All of the press
Your color
Your texture discussed
Endlessly
Nicole Kidman never
Did an ad about us
Cole Porter never
Wrote a song about us
Nor were we mentioned
In a Thornton Wilder novel
You’ve given us no
Skin in the game”
“What about the nasty
Things they say about
Me,” skin replied
“What about skin deep
For superficiality
Or
Skin trade
To denote something
Unsavory
How would you
Like acne rashes
Eczema
Boils
Pellagra
Leprosy
And
Conditions
That astonish
Even dermatologists
I wear my blemishes
In public while you guys
Hide yours”
“Without me and heart
You’d be nothing,” the brain said
“That’s not true,” protested
The liver, “without me he’d
Be nothing”
“No,” the kidney said
“It’s me who keeps the
Body functioning”
The bladder and
The kidney began
To quarrel with
Gallbladder
The lung twins spoke
Up
“Without us
He couldn’t breathe”
Even the esophagus
And the thyroid
And the pancreas
Joined the outbreak
“What about us?”
The eyes said
“Without eyes you
Can’t see”
Their squabble distracted
Them
When they looked
Up from their dust up
Skin’s
Helicopter was up
He was scheduled to
Address a convention of
Plastic surgeons at
The Beverly Hills
Hotel
Escaping by the skin
Of his teeth
His opponents gave
Chase
But above the roar
Of the chopper
They heard him say
“Don’t worry fellas
I got you covered”"
Black Heroism is Unskilled Labor,"Angela makes sure the right people die at the funeral.
A grandchild of the Tulsa Massacre, her skin
is artifice, a call to dream so nothing occurs.
When her yt colleague detonates a suicide bomber
she blocks the blast with a casket. It is common knowledge
that womanism does feminism’s housekeeping.
Much as one might travel, one guilt-trips.
In this case, to Re-Reconstruction Era fantasy.
Did I mention that everyone is a cop, and still
someone is trying to tell a story about justice.
Quiet as it’s kept, take something from the blackbox
and a little black ekes out further into the ethos,
but these stories don’t need to matter; they’re made from it.
I find no proxy here in iconography, genomes ache.
“Okonkwo hangs himself in the end” says Angela,
spoiling the final pages of Things Fall Apart.
“Angela won’t die at the end,” I say, to spoil another thing."
Naming the Baby,"I couldn’t bring myself
to read through Breonna’s social 
media but some say she believed 2020
would be her year. She even
imagined a baby growing steady
in her belly. I imagine her choosing
the baby’s name with care. Taking
all the months she had to name it
something like Pearl or V or Cheryl
There are a million baby names 
to choose from the good book
but what do you name
the baby that never would be
in the year that should’ve been
yours? Do you name her
Revolution? Do you name her
A World Screaming? Do you
name her Fire? Let her burn
             the house down—"
Sonic Fireflies,"the beauty of jazz & blues voices,
syncopation of syllables flowing
free form through improvising sentences
sluicing, embracing, metaphors glowing
eyes in the dark are words imitating
fireflies pulsating bright in a black sky
are gleaming eyes of a prowling black panther
suddenly clicking on bright as flashlight beams
under moon rays probing hidden places
isolated mysterious somewhere
deep in a buzzing alive countryside"
Six,"The Children’s March, 1963
The water pressure from a fire hose
can stop a moving bullet, can ransack
a door wedged shut, and extinguish
any embers, including those we cannot
see. Bull saw us all as threat—the lot
of us, the endless stream that poured
out of our church and onto the street.
We sang and we held hands. We held
onto our purpose—to be true to our God,
true to our native land, to Birmingham,
like the thirsty sponges we were. We
sang a song we’d practiced and knew
by heart. We were not letting anyone turn
us around, turn us around, turn us around. 
I was six and needed something more
than what I thought I knew, a freedom
song, a choice of where to play,
of who could teach me lessons, the very
content of my dreams of what I wanted
to be when I grew up, if I grew up,
when I grew up and took my very next
breath. But let’s get back to that bullet,
stopped by an unequal force, confronted
by mere droplets corralled into sinister
duty. I heard those dogs before I saw them
—growls, snarls—trained to see nothing
of my size, my gentleness. I knew the water
in the air just before it launched me airborne,
ramming me into disbelief, then tree trunk,
then a crowded mass of children’s hips and legs.
I was six and my song ordained that I be seen
as change, or silenced, arrested and contained.
I had lost my shoes and my blue hair ribbons.
I was wearing a muddy crinoline and learned
the coolness of both iron bars and the beady
eyes of hatred, a jailor’s sputum gelling
on the side of my face that I refused to touch."
The New Moon,"There’s a new, young moon riding the hills tonight; 
There’s a sprightly, young moon exploring the clouds; 
There’s a half-shy, young moon veiling her face like a virgin, 
                   Waiting for her lover. "
To Winter,"Stay, season of calm love and soulful snows!
There is a subtle sweetness in the sun,
The ripples on the stream’s breast gaily run,
The wind more boisterously by me blows,
And each succeeding day now longer grows.
The birds a gladder music have begun,
The squirrel, full of mischief and of fun,
From maple’s topmost branch the brown twig throws.
I read these pregnant signs, know what they mean:
I know that thou art making ready to go.
Oh stay! I fled a land where fields are green
Always, and palms wave gently to and fro,
And winds are balmy, blue brooks ever sheen,
To ease my heart of its impassioned woe."
"At Age 28, Chilean Astronomer Maritza Soto Has Already Discovered Three Planets","This poem takes its title from the headline of an article published by Remezcla 
on Sept. 21st, 2018.
Haloed by the glow of the multiverse swirling
above La Silla Observatory, your pyrex eye 
spotted an orb three times the mass of Jupiter.
                                   All these lenses leering at the heavens, 
                                   and yet it was you who identified
                                   HD110014C. You were reluctant to call
           it discovery, perhaps because you know 
           all too well what poisons gush forth
           from that word. Or maybe you suspect 
                                                         you are not the first because you 
                                                         know there is no such thing
                                                         as firsts. Still, you did what no 
gringo ever could: you made another world
visible to nosotrxs. Perchance it was HD110014C 
that actually recognized you long before your
                       spectroscopic lens detected her.
                       It might even be that she had already 
                       decided to entrust you with making
                                              her presence known to our kind.
                                              After all, you proved yourself more
                                              than worthy of such responsibility
when you said your
finding was “not
exceptional,” annihilating
                                   the misguided western patriarchal notion
                                   of greatness too many others have used 
                                   to boost themselves since 1492. 
                                                        You even confessed your introduction 
                                                         to HD110014C
                                                         was entirely an accident,
           a courageous admission that eclipses
           the bumbling arrogance of every Columbus,
           every Cortez, every Pizarro. From 300 million 
                               light years away you glimpsed 
                               another possibility, then befriended
                               two more exoplanets before 
your 28th year around
our lilliputian sun. You, 
sprung from a country
                                   crystillized in its mourning 
                                   of the disappeared, 
                                   met a glorious
                                                                     dawn and flash 
                                                                     fused to emerge 
                                                                     as one
                                              woman search party.
                                              Maestra Maritza, I know
                                              this goes against all
scientific wisdom, but I can’t help but theorize
that these three interstellar marvels you’ve pulled 
into our orbit have become a new home for those 
                       that collapsed into the event horizon 
                       of imperial cruelty. I like to suppose 
                       that our gente were never erased 
but rather beamed to a star system
that does not regard them as merely tool 
or trinket, a galaxy where their dreams 
                                                          are as important as those 
                                                          who dwell in some imaginary 
                                                          North. Could it be, Maritza,
that what you scoped out there among 
the shimmering Allness was in fact 
a reunion pachanga thrown on the gold 
                        dust rings of a wandering star where discovery 
                        is not a sword of Damocles but instead a feathered
                        reentry path for those who have been missing us."
Calling Dreams,"The right to make my dreams come true,
    I ask, nay, I demand of life,
Nor shall fate’s deadly contraband
Impede my steps, nor countermand;
Too long my heart against the ground
Has beat the dusty years around,
And now at length I rise! I wake!
And stride into the morning break!"
How I Pray in the Plague,"I was rehearsing the ecstasies of starvation
for what I had to do. And have not charity,
I found my pity, desperately researching
the origins of history, from reed-built communes
by sacred lakes, turning with the first sprocketed
water-driven wheels.
            —Derek Walcott
In these silences, the bubbles of hurt are indistinguishable from the terror
that lurks in the body—the phrase, “ecstasies of starvation” will have a music
that lures us to peace, but how do I stay with a tender heart of peace and calm
when I slow in my walk in the face of an old saying that has hidden its conundrum
of theology from me—perhaps not hidden, perhaps what I mean is before
I found my pity, my charity, my love, I could slip over the conundrums,
lead us not into temptation—that imperative that has no sensible answer,
for is this the way of a father, and what kind of father must be asked not to tempt me?
And what of the mercy of temptation, and what of the lessons of temptation, 
and what of the diabolical cruelty of testing—you see why I slip over this 
with the muteness of the faith that must grow in increments of meaning?  
In these silences, the bubbles of anxiety, the hurt I cannot distinguish from terror 
is my daily state, and you teach me to pray in this way, and in this way, you teach me 
the path of being led into terror.  I will say this and let it linger, and what I mean 
is that this is the way of poetry for me, for much of what I offer, I am sure of nothing,
the knowing or the outworking, but the trust of its history of resolution—so that I will say, 
this is the origin of history, and by this, I mean this small conundrum: “Lead us not, 
lead me not, lead them not, lead them not,” And what is this were it not the way 
we know the heavy hand of God—that to pray, “Lead them not into temptation”,
is a kind of mercy, and to say, “Lead us not”, is the penitence of a sinning nation 
desperate for the lifting of the curses of contagion and plague. The subtext is the finger 
pointed at the culprit.  So that what kind of father do I tell this to?  Might I have said,
“Neville, please, lead me not into temptation”, what would it mean to tell my old man 
not to lead me into temptation? Must that not be the same as a reprimand to my father, 
a judgment on his propensity to fail me? 
                                                                Do you want answers?  You have come to the wrong
place.  I am selfish with answers. I am hoarding all answers.  Go, instead, to the prophets 
and the preachers, the soothsayers and priests, go to the pundits and the dream readers,
to the pontiffs and kings, to the presidents and mayors, to the brokers in answers. But me, 
I hoard the secrets of my calming beauty, and I walk this road, not as a maker of questions—
this would be a crude wickedness—but with the fabric of our uncertainty, a net stretched 
across the afternoon sky, this is beauty and in this I will trade until all music ends, and the air 
grows crisp as airless grace. They say that if you find honey in the stomach of the baobab tree, 
you must leave the better part for the spirit of the tree, and then share the remnant sweetness
with your neighbors. And what they say, among the reeds, what they say, in the arms of the trees, 
what they say in the shelter of the sky, that is enough for the days of terror and sorrow. Amen."
Because we love each other,"The weather is rude today, too full of good
color and cheer, and makes me want to be out
of here, out of the interior time pandemic time
trauma has made me. I would sing as the canary
passes gently thru the break of my vision; I would
listen as the cat’s ear stings patiently at its Lord;
I would gorge deeply on my own fruit’s womb;
I would entomb blind joy in its spell: et benedictus
fructus ventris tui, Iesus. Iesus is us, and he isn’t,
anymore than Byzantine raised halos and bronze
disease is us, and they are—though most I enjoy
these hiccups come also witty with the breast, with
the breath, in the idea disease, ease, and that we
might just be metal too close together that will infect
each other, brother, brother, sister, sister, sister,
brother, comma, comma, trans—with revision then,
reglistening, which is love, becaused."
In the Vault of Morning,"for our elders
You arrive as found blade for this tale 
I will tell you no gospel you know, 
No crow’s throat will belt guesses 
This year sound out the life I spend 
In the company of those who are all 
On their way to another world
And I am still on your way here 
A mouth as a cold wind
And I rise from me as I rise from me 
And I lift us bad as the night air 
Bad as it in hurricane season  
And sudden as we’re filled with the black wind
I feel nothing like dread
Hold still the planetary language
Who’ll tell you, really, what we’ve done
To speak of walking, of having walked 
Where flocks, animals say, slow lorises, rest 
Something of their tired and bud
To rot our chests of their bright moons
Moons disgorged from a twisting …
No, forget the moon. This time, we know 
The moon does not heed our endless calling 
Or duties for lubricating our worry 
The endless looking up, like a moment ago
When I could mean just anything else
Break into a crowd, a too narrow room,
The Atlantic’s long rage, mean anything at all
Where must I consider to live
With whatever dried longing 
We rise up to be in the morning           rain"
The Day Room,"Keep to yourself—moms’ solemn advice but,
            as soon as I got there, they had it in for me,
long shadows, of boys I knew, in white
            isolation, jumped, cut. There was feces on the wall,
everywhere mice, spoiled milk.
            Festering, we ran inside our minds,
berserk with capture—so much chaos,
            right and wrong is weird in there.
Once we smell weakness, we on you,
            was how The Tailor put it and meant it,
daring a brawl for table rights, the poisoned food.
            Each unheard voice surrounds me,
raging, and gives no quarter."
The Owl,"Downhill I came, hungry, and yet not starved;
       Cold, yet had heat within me that was proof
       Against the North wind; tired, yet so that rest
       Had seemed the sweetest thing under a roof.
Then at the inn I had food, fire, and rest,
       Knowing how hungry, cold, and tired was I.
       All of the night was quite barred out except
       An owl’s cry, a most melancholy cry
Shaken out long and clear upon the hill,
       No merry note, nor cause of merriment,
       But one telling me plain what I escaped
       And others could not, that night, as in I went.
And salted was my food, and my repose,
       Salted and sobered, too, by the bird’s voice
       Speaking for all who lay under the stars,
       Soldiers and poor, unable to rejoice."
A Valentine,"Out of the depths of a heart of love,
     Out of the birth-place of sighs,
Freighted with hope and freighted with fear,
     My all in a valentine, hies.
     Oh, frail little missive
            Of delicate texture,
     Speed thee, on thy journey,
            And give her a lecture! 
Fathom her heart, that seems to me, cold,
     Trouble her bosom, as mine,
Let it be mutual, this that I crave,
     Her ‘yes’ for a valentine.
     Oh, frail little missive,
            In coy Cupid’s keeping,
     Oh! speed back a message,
            To set my pulse leaping."
Nothing to Declare,"There is no name for what rises in you 
as you enter the dim world of the taxi
and wheel through the night, escorted 
by smooth jazz and a battalion of street-
lights. At the airport, you heave the bags 
you have stuffed to the limits of carriage 
and check them in. You have no trouble 
knowing what to do with your empty 
hands. At security, the usual stripping.
You surrender your body to the scan, 
the searching sweep, as if what is dangerous 
is not what cannot be so easily detected.
You comply. At the gate, grateful to be 
early, you sit with your books, plug in 
devices that tether you to this place 
you’re meant to be leaving, that crowd 
out thoughts of arrival and its bittersweet
complications. Yuh going home or just visiting,
someone will ask, and you never know
how you will answer. You know the bones
of your mother’s brown arms will wind 
around you, her breath against your neck
will baptize you again in names you have 
no one to call you in the other place 
you belong to. You know the waiting
untended in you will surge toward her,
and you know something else will sink, 
sulk itself into a familiar, necessary sleep.
You know yourself now only as the ocean 
knows this island—always pulling away, 
always, always, returning."
The blue nightgown,"Can a simple dress become a coping mechanism?
            —NPR August 18, 2020
So many years of misguided self-reflection,
examining every curve in the mirror! Alone,
locked down, I buy online three ice blue
nightgowns I discover I can live in. I glide
through living room, dining room, hall, off the floor
slightly; like the great opera stars of the 20th century,
I’m dressed for singing! My kitchen becomes the stage
of the Met. Cutting the garlic, my hand floats, my
large self floats; I breathe in & out, completely;
the blue nightgown floating around my ankles."
On Time Tanka,"I refuse to choose
between lynch rope and gang rape
the blues is the blues!
my skin and my sex: Deep dues
I have no wish to escape
I refuse to lose
the flame of my single space
this safety I choose
between your fist and my face
between my gender and race
All black and blue news
withers the heart of my hand
and leads to abuse
no one needs to understand:
suicide wipes out the clues
Big-Time-Juicy-Fruit!
Celebrity-Rich-Hero
Rollin out the Rolls!
Proud cheatin on your (Black) wife
Loud beatin on your (white) wife
Real slime open mouth
police officer-true-creep
evil-and-uncouth
fixin to burn black people
killin the song of our sleep
Neither one of you
gets any play in my day
I know what you do
your money your guns your say
so against my pepper spray
Okay! laugh away!
I hear you and I accuse
you both: I refuse

"Counting, This New Year’s Morning, What Powers Yet Remain To Me","The world asks, as it asks daily: 
And what can you make, can you do, to change my deep-broken, fractured?
I count, this first day of another year, what remains. 
I have a mountain, a kitchen, two hands. 
Can admire with two eyes the mountain, 
actual, recalcitrant, shuffling its pebbles, sheltering foxes and beetles.
Can make black-eyed peas and collards.
Can make, from last year’s late-ripening persimmons, a pudding.
Can climb a stepladder, change the bulb in a track light.
For four years, I woke each day first to the mountain, 
then to the question.
The feet of the new sufferings followed the feet of the old, 
and still they surprised.
I brought salt, brought oil, to the question. Brought sweet tea, 
brought postcards and stamps. For four years, each day, something.
Stone did not become apple. War did not become peace. 
Yet joy still stays joy. Sequins stay sequins. Words still bespangle, bewilder. 
Today, I woke without answer. 
The day answers, unpockets a thought from a friend
don’t despair of this falling world, not yet
didn’t it give you the asking"

This evening’s Black sound
Walks like a cat on grass blades
Your nickname two-steps

Get back to your poems
Don’t forget to wear your mask
Main Street is empty

Can’t rock your hoodie
Your cliques of affinity
Might lead to arrest

A virus walk break
Twilight stroll to compost bin
Two rusty leaves rap

Go ’head, bro, dance
There are no mirrors in this joint
You used to love her

Draw her some roses
The before times are ending
Lost my love letters

The maples need to speak up
Detroit Reds all day

To live in this hour
Recall a jukebox love song—
Punk-ass church bells

Perfect ending
A red-tail rolls over the steeple
Dandelion gigs

Pull the dream catcher
A death count on the broadcast
April is chillin’

A bebop wake up
Getting my shit together
Brew some Bustelo"
What of Fire?,"My therapist has approved my drinking of three whiskeys per night,
her eyes forbearing, knowing well the ruthlessness of night.

The sun having fled as a father might flee, my cousin fathered
a narrow terror while he robbed, with a pistol, a fellow citizen one night.

The encouraging lies of a mother are greatly underpaid job-keepers;
slovenly kings have dealt much wrong money to generals and knights.

My childhood was a lengthy scene of make believe and disaccord—
my favorite things being rain and watching my mother’s cigarettes ignite.

What of fire, among its timelessness and musculature, is not
more divine when burning past the open gates of night?"
For a Poet,"I have wrapped my dreams in a silken cloth, 
And laid them away in a box of gold;
Where long will cling the lips of the moth,
I have wrapped my dreams in a silken cloth; 
I hide no hate; I am not even wroth
Who found earth’s breath so keen and cold; 
I have wrapped my dreams in a silken cloth, 
And laid them away in a box of gold."
To a Dead Friend,"The moon still sends its mellow light
Through the purple blackness of the night; 
The morning star is palely bright
                    Before the dawn. 
The sun still shines just as before; 
The rose still grows beside my door, 
                    But you have gone. 
The sky is blue and the robin sings; 
The butterflies dance on rainbow wings
                   Though I am sad. 
In all the earth no joy can be; 
Happiness comes no more to me, 
                   For you are dead. "
Map,"This is the world
so vast and lonely
without end, with mountains
named for men
who brought hunger
from other lands,
and fear
of the thick, dark forest of trees
that held each other up,
knowing fire dreamed of swallowing them
and spoke an older tongue,
and the tongue of the nation of wolves
was the wind around them.
Even ice was not silent.
It cried its broken self
back to warmth.
But they called it
ice, wolf, forest of sticks,
as if words would make it something
they could hold in gloved hands,
open, plot a way
and follow.
This is the map of the forsaken world.
This is the world without end
where forests have been cut away from their trees.
These are the lines wolf could not pass over.
This is what I know from science:
that a grain of dust dwells at the center
of every flake of snow,
that ice can have its way with land,
that wolves live inside a circle
of their own beginning.
This is what I know from blood:
the first language is not our own.
There are names each thing has for itself,
and beneath us the other order already moves.
It is burning.
It is dreaming.
It is waking up."
Realization,"Three-quarter size. Full size would break the heart.
She, still bare-breasted from the auction block,
sits staring, perhaps realizing what
will happen to them next. There is no child,
though there must be a child who will be left
behind, or who was auctioned separately.
Her arms are limp, defeated, her thin hands
lie still in surrender.
He cowers at her side,
his head under her arm,
his body pressed to hers
like a boy hiding behind his mother.
He should protect his woman. He is strong,
his shoulder and arm muscled from hard work,
his hand, thickened by labor, on her thigh
as if to comfort, though he can’t protect.
His brow is furrowed, his eyes blank, unfocused.
What words are there to describe hopelessness?
A word that means both bull-whipped and spat on?
Is there a name for mute, depthless abyss?
A word that means Where the hell are you, God?
What would they ask God, if they could believe?
But how can they believe, while the blue sky
smiles innocently, pretends nothing is wrong.
They stood stripped up there, as they were described
like animals who couldn’t understand
how cheap a life can be made.
Their naked feet. Her collarbone. The vein
traveling his bicep. Gussie’s answer
to presidents on Mount Rushmore,
to monumental generals whose stars
and sabers say black pain
did not then and still does not matter."
Pier 52,"—after a photograph by Alvin Baltrop
He looks through the wound of my life like it’s light. So I let him. The last cube of ice. Outside the tray. Where I found him. My lover. Melts atop this brick, as if it’s our last whiskey together. His brown, more fragrant, more dangerous than whiskey. You couldn’t miss him. Nothing lasts. Of promise. Such is the promise of light. Not even day breaks between us. Black joy, cresting over and over the summer sun. Kept a spiral of his hair, in a box, like a favour. His favourite pair of trainers. The taste of his lips where we first kissed. Where we first blissed. I couldn’t— though I tried. To keep him. Wouldn’t keep. Still. Nor true. Keep up. How could he keep me, when he refused to keep time? Didn’t keep me in compliments. Was I supposed to keep sweet? Look. We discovered day like it was fire. Flesh, like empire. Touch like bloodlight. Yes. Count me down like a missile. As of tomorrow and the day after. As of this darkening gelatin and silver. As of the moon and the monsoon rain. As of these piers. As of America and all its splendour. As of the alleyway and the archive. As of this F-stop. And this fuck. And the next. As of this click and shutter. As of the daffodil and every queer thing that obliterates winter."
SELF PORTRAIT as retratos de cosas locas y de locos (stolen),"for Papo Colo
Shall we have cocktails while slipping about the 
Edge of Catastrophe—gin and tonic for summer
Whiskey sour for fall. All is not well, yet sun
Illumines green leafed trees, soon bare   soon bare
Our eyes prowl fence edges for morning glory vines
Our ears gallop from the booming bass of pumped up cars
Our legs move as swiftly as a catamaran in dock
We mock the heavens with calls for Paradise Now.
Artist perambulating the shadowed alleys of downtown Manhattan
Memories of dream dulled in punk and rock clubs’ filthy bathrooms
How much of what was is still now in the body in the bones of the body
Calcium loss   teeth loose   wrist smaller so all bracelets     jangle  jangle
Lips call repeatedly a song whose words are traces of tenderness
Yet, sung too softly as if only whispers could make the world hear."
Disbelief,"I have all of these
lily plants but not you,
nor peace.
How they ease
my breathing yet
trouble my mind,
symbols
of your soaring
too high to see
or reach,
beauty clanging
like bells
out of tune, time’s
up.         Leaves
so shiny & perfect
they look fake,
but a few brown ones
barely clinging &
curled in on themselves—
less supple, less everything
like me, let me know
they are real.
They are real. Too
real. Lord knows
you were the most real
one can ever be & now
you are really gone!
Your need is over,
but your giving goes on
& on.     Heaven is shedding
desire’s heavy robes, pure
devotion to love’s
bare essence.    You, flowered
& shiny in what’s left
of my heart, teaching me
to rally. No matter
how it may appear,
I’m not rootless.
Today & tomorrow
& the day after that,
you remain evergreen
& ours
somewhere not here,
as my tears land
in potted soil exiled
from its mother, Earth,
like me."
"Character Being a Different Thing from Beauty, Describe the Difference","                 And sometimes, yes, I’d beg for it—
           he’d make me beg: Shy moon, 
                      why shy tonight? 
I heard the geese before I saw them again this morning—
this time, flying north. Above them, thunderheads like doomed 
zeppelins, like whales when sounding, though they brought 
no rain. That’s how I used to write, insisting on ordinary things 
being somehow more than that, that they had to mean something, 
the way disruption can punctuate with meaning an established 
pattern, or as when finding out one’s silence has been mistaken 
for arrogance or, worse, indifference, when all you meant 
was to be kind—retreat, not exile; less the monsters, than 
how we lived beside them, our lives not leaves not trash on an 
updraft that at random carries them then refuses them, can a wind 
refuse. And yet… 
                        Shy moon --
As if doing what we’d always done were enough to be grateful for, 
as if to keep doing it were itself to be grateful. You just forgot, 
that’s all. It’s harder not to forget. How the yard gave way 
like a ragged imperative to a forest of scrub-pines and oak, mostly, 
how a stand of ferns there almost looked, from above, like a boat 
of shadows, coming at last unmoored, and the forest a sea—that 
endless-seeming, that steeped in night-dark, beg for it, why shy
tonight?"
New Year’s Eve in Addis,"Addis is dark at night, as if the low grade
electricity cannot burn through the heavy gloom.
On New Year’s Eve, the shops are emptying,
the pavements are covered with the aromatic
green of cut grass, and women sell bundles
of the welcome carpets and dry firewood.
The smoke begins to thicken in the air –
from bonfires with a red glow at each house
and small dwelling. It is hard to breathe
so far up in the highlands; the air is being
purified – all sins, all errors, all wayward acts
burnt away by flame; the smoke clogs the nostrils
with the acrid reminder of failure. The penitents
will bathe in soft rainwater, cover their skin
with palms full of medicated powder, and the bodies
will be robed in gleaming white – the cloth of hope.
In the dim light of pre-dawn, the women follow
the antiphonal groans of the priests at St. Stephens –
the scent of incense can carry for miles in the cool
morning air. They arrive at the courtyard and begin
to press clean lips to the floor of the sanctuary,
to open clean palms and cup the blessings falling
from the crosses’ maze of lines. Like women
bathing in a river, they scoop the healing on their
heads, their voices muttering the Ge-ez of penitence
until they too can enter the holy place and bow.
The past must enter the blood as ritual – that which
remains is the gold and the precious silver of tradition –
and in this season we learn the theology of forgiveness,
the promise of forgetting all things – the amnesia
of the gospel. It is how a people could forget
the monument of the emperor; how, come Maskal,
the sins of a brutish summer can turn into smoke –
a burning in the eyes, some tears for a while
before the balm of weeping, the cleansing of prayer
and the ordinary rituals of facing new days.
The penitent does not make God; it is God who made
the penitent; it is not for us to know the answers;
questions are for those who have not yet learnt
the insignificance of the short time we are given here."
A Wish,"When your joys are of the sweetest
    And your heart is light and free; 
When your griefs are skimming fleetest, 
    Love, one moment think of me. 
I’d not ask you to remember 
    Me when life is dull and drear;
When your hopes are but an ember
    From a cold and vanished year; 
Sorrow’s far too bleak a burden
    To retain in mem’ry’s hall. 
Friendship has no greater guerdon
    Than to happiness recall. 
So, when roses scent the twilight
    Air with ling’ring dew damp breath, 
Please remember me as eye-bright
    Faith remembers until death."

Breaking Free,"I am pledging allegiance to the flag
in the basement classroom when
my crewcut friend appears at the door
with a message. He whispers to the teacher
who motions to me and I learn that
my dog has followed me to school.
What an occasion, that above all the other
scents in the world, all the other
high-topped sneakers, he has found me out
I learn that he has already made it through
the first grade, where he has
muddied a teacher’s dress with his dark paws.
I imagine his journey as he runs down
the long corridors that smell of chalk dust
and institutional cleanser, cantering
past the principal’s office, the holy of holies,
where the records are kept. I see him sniffing
at the blunt toed shoes of the army
of teachers who find him.
He wags his tail when he sees me, but I am
overcome with my notoriety. Why did you
follow me, why single me out? I get the dog
and put him out the front entrance.
Go home, I tell him, go on home, ignoring
his optimistic eyes, shutting
the great wooden doors
on that part of me that is
without a collar and wild."
Terpsichore,"some hear the song
& ask me of my children:

they mean to say,
what is it like to raise sluts
who draw men off their sacred path?
what’s like to be the minor character
in every story?
it is not my job to protect weak-willed men
who long to be seduced
but curse the ones who’ve master the art
Sirens are the call of emergency

There Will Be No Funeral,"in loving memory of Concepcion Cruz Agullana
Everywhere is a cemetery,
and there will be no funeral.      on either side of the Pacific Ocean.
            No one will give last rites to my lola,    No guessing nurse will call my name or hers
I will have heard no doctor’s steely voice                             There’ll be no waiting room
to call her ‘the body.’             Over the body.      There will be no priest
            swinging a pendulum of incense         no prayers      no rosaries       there’s no money
                        No undertaker will proclaim her life                       There’ll be no glass plate     covering
her wooden casket.           There will be no casket   it’s too expensive              There will be no party
no lumpia            no noodles for no life long enough
                           No black attire               No hands clasping tissue or other hands
‘The body’ will not be seen          There will be my grandma in an urn–a tiny basket
            her curled body that lilted into the afterlife        after dementia   twenty years after grandpa
                                                  there’s no room for every  body
there’s no house for everybody to come in and stay    no room for sorrows    There will be no placeholder no
land     no candles        no water         no six-foot empty         she will be unmarked
                                                            my lola, an unnamed earthquake
           No one will hear her long name how it stretches a sunset   if my lola dies and no one sees   is
she still my lola?  is a canyon a series of cliffs?   there’s no place in the apartment for what rituals
maybe they will send her to the Philippines my grandma is a maybe                   and we are not they

this small poem the only eulogy            where we’ll put my grandma     her existence laid to rest in a

where will we put my grandma when we can’t afford our grief?"
It Doesn't Take Much,"On my front door stone, a dead frog.
It’s stretched out long,
its slender legs a mottled green,
its belly cream white,
a blossom of blood on the stone.
How did it get here? Why did it die?
It doesn’t take much to make me see
how little I know
about the simplest things.
I’ll tell you stories, of course—
that it was possibly a fisher cat,
or more likely
was dropped, accidentally by an owl
or a startled hawk,
or a heron.
Or is the dead frog an ambassador
sent from the wetland world?
I lift it gingerly, the frog still
limber, no rigor mortis,
not yet,
and I put it aside, in a paper bag,
to take out later for burial—
I have a dog with a keen nose.
But when I come for it, the paper bag
is rustling, is jumping—
alive!
             And so I carry the frog
far down to the pond’s edge
and settle it into the shade of the cattails.
When death arrives on your door stone,
you think about it.
When death turns out to be life, injured life,
you’re glad.
                     And turn back to your own."
Poem Not to Be Read at Your Wedding,"You ask me for a poem about love 
in place of a wedding present, trying to save me 
money.  For three nights I’ve lain 
under glow-in-the-dark stars I’ve stuck to the ceiling 
over my bed.  I’ve listened to the songs 
of the galaxy.  Well, Carmen, I would rather 
give you your third set of steak knives 
than tell you what I know.  Let me find you 
some other, store-bought present.  Don’t  
make me warn you of stars, how they see us 
from that distance as miniature and breakable 
from the bride who tops the wedding cake 
to the Mary on Pinto dashboards 
holding her ripe, red heart in her hands.     "

14 Love Songs,"Above a pond, I sit on a wooden bench
and throw pebbles into the willows.
A rush of sunlight and wind creates a path in a channel of water, dances
between the melting ice and brown islands of bulrush.
The resident osprey, its eyes the color of yellow grass,
follows my tossing hand.
Love is a diorama of inner life in an outer world.
I look down and find a chunk of fossilized rock
with an entire Paleozoic shell sticking out.
I am not afraid of love, but terrified of how it is my steady guide.
Once, when tired, I wandered off the trail and crawled under a tree to rest.
I woke to a young brown bear licking my boot.
Nothing had ever felt that good.
When I say I love you, what I mean is I wouldn’t leave you.
Even if love is not loved back it doesn’t go away,
although it may become a black hole.
Could this be what it’s like for trees to lose the green from their leaves?
At noon the light shifts and the pond turns
into a mosaic of opaque green ice.
Orange carp rise in these cold watery chambers to breathe at the surface.
Always I am in love. Face to face with the sun. Face to face with the moon."
For Kathryn,"A hummingbird hovers above the branches outside the window.
Soon the earth will rise again.
Waking from earth’s sleep,
green leaves begin to emerge.
Tiny purple flowers bloom like tiny notes of music.
Háshínee’, and so it is.
We called you loved one;  we called you   daughter,   sister,   wife,   mother,   grandmother;
we called you.   friend,    teacher.
After we have feasted in your honor, remembered you in tender ways,
told stories of you,
and the rain has washed away our tears,
we will give you back to the other side.
  We will release you.
                   We will sing you back to your relatives,

What Schools Don’t Teach Black Boys in America Today,"After Langston Hughes & Sterling Brown
I’ve known rivers long enough to know:
not enough black boys
take their marks at the start line,
      perch on a high wire
      overlooking the world,
      their wings spread wide,
      ready to soar toward the sun,
not enough take the stage,
      except to sing, dance, rap rhymes,
      or mime to songs wearing white-painted faces.
Maybe they’d rather watch and listen
      than read Douglass, Baldwin, and King,
or cruise, chill, shoot hoops, and wander a mall
      than stand unpainted,
      reciting Langston, Terrance,
      Danez, and Jericho.
It shouldn’t matter that white boys,
      whom the world expects to win,
            can wear the black mask,
            Poitier-Denzel-Idris-style,
      like auditioning for a Broadway show___
      morning-bird voice, thick-lipped,
      bulging tight pants and all,
      with a little James Brown swagger
      stepping toward the stage.
Maybe too many black boys in America today
know too much
of shallow streams and dry, desert sands,
don’t hear the bell
      their silence rings
      of untold pain
      that keeps a boy inside a man,
and don’t hear words
of strong black men
who’ve known ancient, dusky rivers,
      men who curse love
      for not loving back,
      who stumble,
      fall, or get knocked down,
      but get up,
      speak truth out loud,
and make a way out of no way
with nothing but a tom-tom
crying, laughing, and singing in their hearts."
Ship of Theseus,"The other day I realized I wasn’t me.
The me I was when I was
a cloud’s infinite possible shapes.
A Ship of Theseus: the original ship,
stored in a museum, slowly rots away
and its parts are gradually replaced.
Eventually none of the original parts remains.
Is it still the same ship? I think of how weak
my hands were in the music library
listening to Berlioz. How rough they are
washing my daughter’s bottles.
My eyes are a different mood.
I have been repurposed to live for someone else.
In a nearby warehouse, the original ship parts
are stored and re-pieced into a corpse.
Which is the ship? Neither, knowing real things,
like music, take no body.
One or the other if conflict is psalm.
Both, with the same aim of survival.
Both, with loss as the same mother."
under the chiming bell,"under the chiming bell
I learn to move as ghosts do
after thirty five years of belching
I finally qualify as a trophy
in the woods I am mostly small
~ insignificant ~
in love with nothing and no one
boredom is a kind of armor
capitalism no longer contagious
seeing with my own eyes
each raindrop ceasing to exist
still I fear birth as much as death
the non-consent of existence
will never be resolved in no lifetime
has anyone ever lived
through someone else’s ending
or just me?
so weird being allowed to enter
not as a servant
but as a guest
the crudeness of patronage
all those childhood prayers
wasted essentially
in the end I was not too beautiful for this
failed to be much of an exception at all
at least I can still dream
to possess the kind of face
often inscribed into archways
mid-scream like a gargoyle with nothing
better to do
the holy don’t need us
wretches of a different order
looking for someone or nothing
I was supposed to be staff
then everything changed
and it didn’t even matter I was born wrong
will someone tell someone who I am
will someone please please tell me"
Surah,"the falling paper flower
the plastic tree branch
the plight of reminiscing
the bureaucracy of kismet
the factories empty of logic
the bins to hold what’s done
the spaceship of butterflies
the video game of intimacy
the series premiere of strife
the discretion of the cosmos
the sharp wisdom of the young
O friend who reads in a cave w/o light
the comb detangling the scars
forward is not so far away"
Order of Events,"First, he taught us to use the dead as shawls
in the viscous winter escorting his arrival.
Next, he taught us to forget the dead
were dead, our dead, and dead because of a wager
we did not consent him to make with the thin-lipped
savior of his own pantomime. Third, he delivered
on promises that blew off the tops of homes
in places whose names he could not pronounce.
Uneasy lies the head that wears the crown1
forced to fit a quiet country that has no need
for a crown. Where once was honey unhived
competition. The drones meant for war
prepared for war. We dusted our shoulders
of Shadows’ silent reconnaissance, surveilled
as practice for a slaughter we did not consent to.
The royal parade pride’s malady stomped
its sequence through beat drums of human skin
from which emanated a rhythm impossible
to decipher. I too would shake my ass
to the sound of stars falling night-
wise into a pit of myth-bent nomenclature
if the names sounded like home. Under eroding
circumstances, this kingdom could become home.
Under eroding circumstances my gasp
has become home enough, love not
consented to yet detected from beneath
my mindless right hand pressing its devotion
to ritual over my heart, flag above waving heaven
and blood into the smoke-diffused sky I
quake my way through anthems beneath. Rockets
glaring off my breath forced to evidence I belong.
The crown is crooked. We straighten it
with vote-vapid hands. The crown sits too heavy
for the king to carry on his own. When it falls
“O say can you see,” strikes its inquisition.
My knees, summoned to straighten at the hinges
permission most questionably opens from,
strike the earth with a kiss. Could I
kneel my way to revolution?
Would that goad the king to unzip?
1 King Henry IV, Part Two"
Ode on an Abandoned House,"Wind and rain, here
are the keys
to the house—
a missing door,
two broken windows.
Birds, for you a room
with a view—the bedroom,
which once held
the moon and stars
out of sight.
Ants and worms,
such sad witnesses,
the grass uncut,
the yard overgrown
are again yours to inherit.
And you, the leaves whirling
across buckled floors,
please take
my father’s voice
whispering
May you live forever,
may you bury me."
Hope,"O Hope! into my darkened life
    Thou hast so oft’ descended;
My helpless head from failure’s blows,
    Thou also hast defended;
When circumstances hard, and mean,
    Which I could not control,
Did make me bow my head with shame,
    Thou comforted my soul. 
When stumbling blocks lay all around,
    And when my steps did falter,
Then did thy sacred fires burn
    Upon my soul’s high altar.
Oft’ was my very blackest night
    Scarce darker than my day,
But thou dispelled those clouds of doubt,
    And cheered my lonely way.
E’en when I saw my friends forsake, 
    And leave me for another,
Then thou, O Hope, didst cling to me
    Still closer than a brother;
Thus with thee near I groped my way
    Through that long, gloomy night
Till now; yes, as I speak, behold, 
    I see the light! the light!"
Reciprocity is a Two-Way Street,"“It isn’t right to despise one’s country
I don’t deserve to be loved and left.”
—Faysal Cumar Mushteeg
Say you are reading Barthes, or rereading Barthes, 
two acts which are hardly independent of each other.  
Say it’s A Lover’s Discourse: Fragments, and you are all aflush,  
your finger tracing the outline of flight, Either woe or well-being, he writes,  
Sometimes I have a craving to be engulfed.  
And even though this could mean anything, you think you know what it means 
to shiver with well-practiced yearning.   
Not for provincial beginnings, nor Moroccan boys,  
but for lip-shaped crescent moons left on teacups. 
An oil splash of a man with scarred hands.  
In this poem, he doesn’t have a name.  
Your own dumb luck pools around your ankles. We skirt around it, a kindness.  
It disgusts you, the depth of this need,  
like the slick walls of a well.   
Your bones ache most when held. 
Eventually, you’ll have to stop impersonating a skimmed stone.  
There are other ways of parting. 
You annotate Barthes annotating Keats, half in love with easeful death. 
Over-identify until you are light-headed, until you remember a hot, loud classroom.  
Breathless bluetooth blues, a free school meal in your belly, 
the easy cruelty of teachers at under-performing schools,  
so unlike their counterparts in the movies,  
those loose-tied English teachers who promise you 
a world so much bigger than this. So much easier than this. 
Chipped neon nail polish competing against your prized set of highlighters,  
you mistake a poem for a blueprint. First the odes, then the Jane Campion film.  
That night, you dreamt of lavender fields, bruised eyelids,  
the shape of Rome’s dying sunlight on a poet’s grave.  
                    Here lies one whose name was writ in water 
No name. No date. This was all Keats wanted. Convinced they knew better,  
his friends contextualised their grief, added the rest.  
This Grave contains all that was mortal, of a YOUNG ENGLISH POET,  
who on his Death Bed, in the Bitterness of his heart,  
at the Malicious Power of his enemies,  
desired these words to be Engraven on his Tomb Stone.  
You think of how casually our bodies are overruled by kin, by blood,  
by heartaches disguised as homelands.  
How you can count the years you have lived for yourself on one hand.  
History is the hammer. You are the nail. 
In another dream, your mother is barefoot and young,  
wearing a scarf the colour of a wound. By Fontana del Moro, a Moor adrift  
on a conch shell leans over her shoulder,  
as she unpeels her wet dress from her legs.  
Unmoored, she laughs at this new country calling itself an old one.  
These fictions she tosses like loose coins.  
We don’t dare dip our hands further than they can reach.  
Her gold bracelets slide down the silk flags of her wrists.  
Nightly, you strive to write a loose translation of this. 
Arterial blood is theatrical, like the desire for a time before your time.  
The world will not stop when you do, or even before.  
Yes, being the one who survived, the one who made it to this side,  
is a full-time job.  
But no-one asked you to take it.  
Diaspora is witnessing a murder without getting blood on your shirt.  
Your body is the evidence of its absence.  
Of course, there are other definitions.  
Namely, a freshly scraped scalp, dome of your rock,  
the inevitability of fajr and late-night texts,  
each lie about how good the exchange rate was.  
That time he cried telling you the story of why his family had left Sweden,  
the image of a younger brother held underwater by wild-eyed classmates.  
Definitions, like flags, lay claim to what has always existed.  
For now, these will do. You can’t speak for the future.  
It barely speaks for you.  
Pick a mask and ask me to wear it. You only know love like this,  
an interpretation you can’t outrun.  
A footnote to haunt the page.  "
"On the Last Day, the Bullet is Asked","How was I supposed to know 
Medgar? I only met the man once 
and even then, freshly fallen,
back flesh a sea split red 
with god’s permission. I do 
as I am asked and no more—
back, chest, window, wall, sinew,
bone glass, brick—as quick as it 
began. For you so loved the son 
of man, you begat the sweat-swaddled
plunk of viscera on concrete. And man 
so loved the silence he begat the close 
hold of a barrel, the blank stare cutting 
clean to the other side: a family and greens
on the table two low beds where
stuffed animals still hold the child-
smell of milk, baby powder, Ovaltine.
Outside, the Magnolias, whispering.
Inside, the silence locking in place."

Find a large, unframed mirror. Or, if you don’t have mirrors, find something like one: smooth, flat, and reflective, with superstitions silvered in.
Beat it with the most vulnerable part of your body. If you are having trouble deciding what to use, ask yourself: what would you least want me to touch?
Continue until the mirror breaks. Then, continue until it breaks many times.
Continue until you can tell that your body part is badly hurt. Keep going. When you regain consciousness, resume.
On the sixth day, stop. Search for the brightest, clearest light you can imagine. The light should at first feel welcome, and joyous. Then, as you realize that it is slightly more garish than you would like and moreover that it never fades, it riddles your body with a ringing.
Carry each fragment, shard, and piece into this light. Do not clean the parts. Arrange them into a shape resembling the original shape of the mirror.
If you are not already naked, become naked now.
Lie on the fragments. Try not to add more injuries to your body.
Feel the light reflect into heat. As you blister, consider the way that on Earth, every night, in the absence of sunlight, tree branches move up and down so that the water inside of the trees keeps moving, creating a kind of heartbeat that is surer than any you will ever know."
The Witch Reads Me My Birthchart,"she says the planets & stars show that I’m too good at being alone
I have unresolved traumas from past lives it is true
there were difficulties during my delivery even in the womb
I had a bad feeling cord around my throat as I tried
to make passage forced into this world or rather out of another
by extraction the witch asks if I often feel guilty
asks if I try to heal those around me despite finding it difficult
to bond with anyone other than myself
she wants to know about my childhood memories
if I’m alone in them
& I admit I stop listening though I can still hear
the untroubled tone in her voice vowels elongated
mouth full of sounds like spandex bursting at the seams
I want to go back to the stars we’ve strayed so far from the planets
she says there’s much to learn about my sources of pain
the gaping wound I will try to alleviate for the rest of my life
I want to touch her long hair as if it were my hair
I want to convince her I believe in everything she believes
but I demand too much of faith
like apples in the market I inspect the curves & creases
put them back at the slightest sign of bruising"
Love in Outer Space,"Because the bee
In my bonnet
Is the B in my bed,
Who I can’t and I
Won’t stop bumping;
We do the humpty
Hump. My big nose
Nestled in her sassafras.
At attention, we round
Each other out. At ease, 
Her peach is a galaxy.
Now and later is a square
I quietly hold on my tongue,
My mouth an empty gesture. 
Spaced out between her legs, 
I am an astronaut.
The gravity of my offense
Adds up to a rational number.
When the heavens are free
From light, I sit desire on my lap.
She is stardust; And I, 
As it were, am impossible.  
When she asks for space
She is the future. When she
Asks for a room, it is the end. 
I place before her chutes,
Ladders, and whatever else
Might fall from the sky."
To Rebuild,"The house was built,  
Brick by brick, pane by pane,  
Initially withstanding winds,  
The force of a hurricane. 
But over time, the faults are found  
As storm after storm  
Assails, the craftsmanship outdated,  
In need of reform. 
The windows break, one by one,  
Under the weight of wrongs, the structure strains, 
Until one day fire catches,  
And only the foundation of good intentions remains.  
While easiest would be to walk,  
To abandon, moving on to rebuild,  
The value is seen by those who have called it 
Home, desires to be fulfilled.  
Remembering the mistakes,  
Maintaining the hope of freedom,  
Hand in hand, we work,  
Entering a new season.  
The work is not complete until  
The walls protect all who live there,  
No exceptions. Abandonment of all  
Unnecessary despair.  
A job led by all, not by one,  
We work long days turn long nights.  
The creation of our hands  
Proving more than surface level acknowledgment of rights.  
The past is not buried  
But underlies 
What we have transformed  
Before our eyes."
The Power of Hope Today,"Today’s hope is a flickering candle that dwells in a snow-dusted window,
circulating the prayers of Christmas mornings.
Today’s hope is the crisp daffodil in colorless photos,
containing the soul of a small
child,
who only wishes and knows of
peace and love.
Today’s hope is the sparkling eyes that
truly believe in achieving
anything to reach unity.
Today’s hope is the palm to palm connection
bracing each other for the climb neither expected,
but couldn’t abandon.
Today’s hope is peering
beyond
the lingering barrier,
but still recognizing the diversity in ourselves.
Today’s hope has been dimmed and tossed recklessly,
but still generously stays with us,
for we cannot help but come back
like wide eyed children to candy.
We are said to be weak to rely on such strength,
but we are only believers.
That spark
That gives science a baffled case
And oceans an infinite plane,
is the eagle that dips
and soars
and fights,
which stands for
the hope of
today. "
In Pursuit of Dawn,"I have never heard America described as quiet.
Even street lights seem to pulse to some interminable heartbeat
beneath buildings endeavoring for the clouds.
Our purposeful words often laced in ample volume.
In such social engagements
all varieties of people run together—
words flowing, ideas pooling—
eager to share and just as soon to hear.
But have ideas—opportunities—collaborations
extending beyond the bounds of our borders
with reverberations felt through every city, capital, and country
ever began with silence and seclusion?
My stepfather created opportunity
from the destitute nothing he was dealt,
consoled only by the American dream
that came as whispers under snow-dappled stars.
And from these muffled mumblings
he bettered his situation.
He is one of America’s thousands,
evidence of excellence obtained by
those in pursuit of changing their fortune.
And as snow-ridden summits yield to streams
and torrid deserts to the placid waltz of grassy plains,
each of us—
guided by the compass of our will—
is free to climb, swim, or walk
to wherever we may choose.
All countries of ample years have a shadow beneath their flag
cast by historical inequities amended too late.
But how it still catches the propitious wind!
Always endeavoring to fly higher and baste the somber shade beneath.
As it flutters, we stand reverently
for those who can no longer
and for those who cannot yet.
The horizon an interminable stretch of past and future
we gaze upon it, in remembrance of what was,
yet trekking forward toward what can be.
We are a coalescence of voices,
each with unparalleled inflection,
yet our conglomeration of somber and elated tones
still manages to reach harmony.
The diversity of our country
—of opinions and cultures and beliefs—
as extraordinary as the vast, varying landscapes.
Some tall, imposing, confident as the Rockies;
the great height of their achievements
not formidable but inspiring.
Still others humble and hushed as the plains;
yet their voice embodied in the breeze touches all.
From mountains to marshes to mesas,
we are united in the embrace of the same two seas.
Invaluable are contrasting beliefs
bridged by curiosity and a common desire for betterment.
A miscellany not of problems but possible solutions are we.
Speak up, I implore you,
for in your voice we might find the answer.
The American dream—
one smile, one sunrise,
one decision to pursue an insatiable passion
for words, for equality, for science
—away from the American reality.
When hardships splatter like ebony ink across the skyline,
extinguishing the hues still smoldering from the former day,
pinpricks of hope still remain.
And in these celestial bodies we find solace,
arranging the stars against the somber background into
symbols and pictures of progress.
And beneath them we endure in pursuit of dawn."
Tomorrow is a Place,"for Maya
We meet at a coffee shop. So much time has passed and who is time? Who is waiting by the windowsill? We make plans to go to a museum but we go to a bookshop instead. We’re leaning in, learning how to talk to each other again. I say, I’m obsessed with my grief and she says, I’m always in mourning. She laughs and it’s an extension of her body. She laughs and it moves the whole room. I say, My home is an extension of my body and she says, Most days are better with a long walk. The world moves without us—so we tend to a garden, a graveyard, a pot on the windowsill. Death is a comfort because it says, Transform but don’t hurry. There is a tenderness to growing older and we are listening for it. Steadier ways to move through the world and we are learning them. A way to touch your own body. A touch that says, Dig deeper. There, in the ground, there is our memory. I am near enough my roots. Time is my friend. Tomorrow is a place we are together."
"After Touching You, I Think of Narcissus Drowning","How desire is a thing I might die for. Longing a well,
a long dark throat. Enter any body
of water and you give yourself up
to be swallowed. Even the stones
know that. I have writhed
against you as if against the black
bottom of a deep pool. I have emerged
from your grip breathless
and slicked. How easily
I could forget you
as separate, so essential
you feel to me now. You
beneath me like my own
blue shadow. You silent as the moon
drifts like a petal
across your skin, my mouth
to your lip—you a spring
I return to, unquenchable, and drink."
STILL UNBUTTONED & UNBOTHERED: On Imagining That Freedom Probably Feels Like Getting the Itis,"The table settles. Before you
is a series of well-seasoned scraps
framed in silverware and open
palms. The entire kitchen
exhales and every torso
leans back in unison, a table blossoming
bodies in satisfaction.
Someone pops open a button,
and then another. Several burps
that interrupt, scoff at the hand
cupped around the mouth,
bellow with pleasure
as they fling out of the body
in triumph. Every bra is undone
unceremoniously, straps wilting
out of shirt sleeves or across furniture.
The land of satiation. The land of, if it itches,
scratch it. Land of pleasure. Everything
sagging with joy. Someone passes gas
loudly. It is full and foul, but no one
is embarrassed by the scent
of a body that has gotten exactly
what it needed.
                                              The stench of enough.
My god, to be so satisfied you reek of it.
Smell badly of, I do not want more,
I have had my fill. To stink of gratitude,
to be immobilized by its weight. The eyelids
flutter, nearly drunk with it. Here, the body
so saturated and somehow fears
nothing. What a condition
for the body, so unlike
the state I am in. So enough
that all it must do
is sleep."
poem where no one is deported,"now i like to imagine la migra running
into the sock factory where my mom
& her friends worked. it was all women
who worked there. women who braided
each other’s hair during breaks.
women who wore rosaries, & never 
had a hair out of place. women who were ready
for cameras or for God, who ended all their sentences
with si dios quiere. as in: the day before 
the immigration raid when the rumor
of a raid was passed around like bread
& the women made plans, si dios quiere.
so when the immigration officers arrived
they found boxes of socks & all the women absent.
safe at home. those officers thought
no one was working. they were wrong.
the women would say it was god working.
& it was god, but the god 
my mom taught us to fear
was vengeful. he might have wet his thumb
& wiped la migra out of this world like a smudge
on a mirror. this god was the god that woke me up
at 7am every day for school to let me know
there was food in the fridge for me & my brothers.
i never asked my mom where the food came from,
but she told me anyway: gracias a dios.
gracias a dios del chisme, who heard all la migra’s plans
& whispered them into the right ears
to keep our families safe."
Undoing,"In winter traffic, fog of midday
shoves toward our machines—snow eclipses
the mountainscapes
I drive toward, keeping time against
the urge to quit moving. I refuse to not
know how not to, wrestling
out loud to music, as hovering me—automatic
engine, watching miles of sky on the fall—loves such
undoing, secretly, adding fuel to
what undoes the ozone, the endless nothing
manifested as sinkholes under permafrost.
Refusal, indecision—an arctic
undoing of us, interrupting cascades—
icy existences. I cannot drive through."
Silence,"Silence with you is like the faint delicious
Smile of a child asleep, in dreams unguessed:
Only the hinted wonder of its dreaming, 
The soft, slow-breathing miracle of rest. 
Silence with you is like a kind departure
From iron clangor and the engulfing crowd
Into a wide and greenly barren meadow, 
Under the bloom of some blue-bosomed cloud;
Or like one held upon the sands at evening, 
When the drawn tide rolls out, and the mixed light 
Of sea and sky enshrouds the far, wind-bellowed
Sails that move darkly on the edge of night."
My Song,"I sang me a song, a tiny song, 
   A song that was sweet to my soul,
And set it a-float on the sea of chance
   In search of a happy goal.

I said to my song: “Go on, go on
   And lodge in a tender spot
Of some human soul where the fires of hate
   And selfishness are not.”

My song went on but a little space
   And hied it back to me;
And fell at my feet in a sorry plight—
   The victim of cruelty.

I gazed a moment and quickly saw
   Just how it had come about,
A cruel critic had caught my song
   And probed the soul of it out.

O, poor indeed is the human mind
   (And why was it ever wrought?)
That can thrive on husk in the form of words,
   And not on a sturdy thought."
Object Permanence,"This neighborhood was mine first. I walked each block twice:
drunk, then sober. I lived every day with legs and headphones.
It had snowed the night I ran down Lorimer and swore I’d stop
at nothing. My love, he had died. What was I supposed to do?
I regret nothing. Sometimes I feel washed up as paper. You’re
three years away. But then I dance down Graham and
the trees are the color of champagne and I remember—
There are things I like about heartbreak, too, how it needs
a good soundtrack. The way I catch a man’s gaze on the L
and don’t look away first. Losing something is just revising it.
After this love there will be more love. My body rising from a nest
of sheets to pick up a stranger’s MetroCard. I regret nothing.
Not the bar across the street from my apartment; I was still late.
Not the shared bathroom in Barcelona, not the red-eyes, not
the songs about black coats and Omaha. I lie about everything
but not this. You were every streetlamp that winter. You held
the crown of my head and for once I won’t show you what
I’ve made. I regret nothing. Your mother and your Maine.
Your wet hair in my lap after that first shower. The clinic
and how I cried for a week afterwards. How we never chose
the language we spoke. You wrote me a single poem and in it
you were the dog and I the fire. Remember the courthouse?
The anniversary song. Those goddamn Kmart towels. I loved them,
when did we throw them away? Tomorrow I’ll write down
everything we’ve done to each other and fill the bathtub
with water. I’ll burn each piece of paper down to silt.
And if it doesn’t work, I’ll do it again. And again and again and—"
Ode to Sudanese-Americans,"basma & rudy were first         each holding

my face as their faces             & we pierced

on holding rose water,"My family never stopped migrating. We fight
so hard. With each other and ourselves. Don’t
talk about that. Not now. There is never
a good time and I learn that songs are the only
moments that last forever. But my mother
always brings me the instant coffee my
dede drank before he died. She wraps it
so carefully in a plastic bag from the market
that we go to when Caddebostan feels unreachable.
We don’t talk about that. Or the grief.
Or my short hair. I want to know what
dede would have said. I want to know that he
can feel the warm wind too if he tried.
We fight so hard. We open the tops of
each other’s heads and watch the birds
fly out. We still don’t talk about my dede."
Take Wing Tempo,"We ran barefoot on pavement
before a girl tripped on a rock,
got third and fourth lips,
a new hairline.
We jumped from swings, aiming
for grass beyond the gravel path.
We flipped over the frame to float,
weightless girls who didn’t matter.
There’s a scar in the shape of Africa
on my right knee, a faceless dime
on my wrist. I expect flight,
but brace to land on my back.
How I could’ve loved you with that body,
heart that instructs a girl to climb fences
taller than her house, or fight a bully
who already shaves her knees.
What chords a pulse plucks. It plays
in thumbs pressed together. Some night
I’d like to leap from the headboard,
double up, wonder at the blood in our grins."
Day 29 (2020),"after Nazim Hikmet
it’s April 13th 2020, my mother’s 60th birthday
and i’m sitting on the couch from my old apartment 
in my new apartment, and Pidgeon’s wind chimes are loud 
outside my window    
i never knew i liked wind chimes
i think Mom used to have some outside her office
she had tabletop fountains and hunks of amethyst 
crystals the size of my face
i used to hate how she made us meditate 
learn reiki on the weekends
now i’m calling her every other day 
for the new old remedy
i hate how much i cared about being cool 
when i was younger, carrying mom’s tupperware
in brown paper bags wishing for a lunchable
something disposable with a subtler scent  
now i am ecstatic to see tupperware 
stacked in my fridge, the luxury 
of leftovers instead of chopping 
another onion 
i used to lie in bed on Sunday evenings wishing 
for a whole week of weekends
now i forget what day it is 
and still feel i’m running out of time 
i never knew i hated washing my hands this much
i sing “Love On Top” while scrubbing 
to make sure i hit twenty seconds
my sister hears me singing and asks 
if i am happy. no, i say
i’m just counting"
Jasmine,"With dusk’s slow bleed, the scent comes back 
from beyond our gate, sickly-sweetly powdering the yard
and its scattered buckets, chalk, decapitated 
plastic fauna—how all the bright junk 
rushes to the pixelated surface 
in the final minutes before remorse 
douses the world in itself. High-tops on the phone wire
already mortared into silhouettes, like crows.
Roof rat in the plum tree, synching its intricate listening 
with the stop-start taps on my MacBook 
ten feet beneath. Wondering what’s taking us so long
to vanish. Its tail pulses from its rich perch 
with what I thought I had once—a hunger 
so absorbing it becomes, while nothing changes,
its own reward. Some hidden dark
where you could crouch and find a pattern. 
While nothing changes; while the scent of jasmine
flutters and drifts, like sympathy, living for itself."
"That is solemn we have ended,— (87)","That is solemn we have ended,—
     Be it but a play,
Or a glee among the garrets,
     Or a holiday,
Or a leaving home; or later,
     Parting with a world
We have understood, for better
     Still it be unfurled."
The New Decade,"I keep thinking there’s a piano nearby.
I keep thinking it’s my favorite song. It’s my favorite song!
Below the marquee, I arrange the marquee:
Happy New Year, buddy. Happy ’nother one, sweetheart.
Out of ways to call you dead, I decide to call you busy,
call you at midnight from West Oakland.
These days I raise a glass to make sure it’s empty.
Even when I was a drunk, I thought champagne was pointless.
In my two-story civility, I stick my head out
each window & scream. S’cuse me, s’cuse me,
I’m trying to remember a story about gold,
about a giant falling from the sky.
Someone once asked who I prayed to.
I said a boy with a missing front tooth.
In this order, I ask, first, for water,
which might mean mercy,
which might mean swing by in an hour
& I’ll tell you the rest.
If you were here we’d dance, I think.
If you were here, you’d know what to do
what to do with all this time"
Never Enough of Living,"Never, my heart, is there enough of living,
Since only in thee is loveliness so sweet pain;
Only for thee the willows will be giving
Their quiet fringes to the dreaming river;
Only for thee so the light grasses ever
Are hollowed by the print of windy feet,
And breathe hill weather on the misty plain;
And were no rapture of them in thy beat,
For every hour of sky
Stillborn in gladness would the waters wear
Colors of air translucently,
And the stars sleep there.

Gently, my heart, nor let one moment ever
Be spilled from the brief fullness of thine urn.
Plunge in its exultation star and star,
Sea and plumed sea in turn.
O still, my heart, nor spill this moment ever."
Ready for My Statement?,"You know I know what I’m doing.
I’m always with you.
I’m watching these lines get to you.
This is how we’re close.
We can’t have knowing looks
(we’re both as good as dead)
so we have these knowing lines,
typing till the clock says stop.
And if in the course of struggle
a foot slips and we fall,
what does that matter?
I won’t come back to you
when the song is over.
I will not want you
or your unsuitable house and lot.
Expect to miss me, though—
expect ice and snow, rain and hail.
To be embarrassed. To be changed.
To write the year on a check
and be one hundred years off.
To let it go
when I express displeasure.
To let my anger go. Just drop it. Just take it
as you drop it.
Just take it
and go."

Dog Park,"I told Alli I really wanted
to write a poem called “Dog Park.”
In bed she’s like you could make it
a New Yorker poem, where you
go to a dog park and then have some
huge epiphany. And then we
have a soft debate as to whether
a poem called “Dog Park”
needs a dog park in it or
not, or even a dog. I dunno.
But I do I know I don’t want
to get up out of bed, not now,
five milligrams of warm indica
coaxing me into its native land
of sleep, to write down Alli’s
idea for my poem “Dog Park”
and I tell her so and she says
get up, you’re a poet, and it’s
true, so I shuffle off this
warm, magnificent mattress,
firm as the back of a Golden
Retriever in the prime of life.
The blinds in the bedroom
are shut tight against the mean
lights of the Pacific East Mall
that moan all night and make
the nearby bedrooms bright.
But I get up, ugh, to write
down what might be the
beginning of a poem called
“Dog Park,” with or without a
dog park or even a dog. And
obviously you’d rather be
a cloud than a poet, Jesus.
Or the plastic tip of a vape pen
or the floating lint in the store
where they sell beds and sheets
and pillows and duvets or even
a grody hunk of sand on the
ground of a dog park, my
nightmare. But it will just
take a minute or two, and then
I can pee one last time with
impunity, double check the
door is locked, go back to bed,
wait for the next one."
The Imperishable and Perishable Family,"There was a husband-father at one time, distinguished in phrases but not in gestures.
There was a daughter circulating in vain attempts, calculating the usage of efforts,
I’m afraid to say. I had painted her in pearly fabric
amidst the lost husband-father who blew up our foundation
when he sought to line draw the exaggerations in our field: what were perished
actions of the family. I thought to resuscitate it all and my cheeks blew inward.
I was holding all my breath inside. This wasn’t a good idea.
So does this world spring from the imperishable, says The Upanishads.
And led me to ask for a crystalline idiom, because in finding
the daughter, I lost myself. I realized (too late)
I was granted tyranny for all the lost occasions.
My therapist calls this manipulation. I decided to stake its claim.
I will be done now. I knew I was the hat trick for them.
And thus I’m over with the game because the game had since
been done with me—I had no idea until I blew and blew and blew."
A Song of Hope,"Day is at the gate,
    I am risen late;
Clouds laze in the air,
    Clouds sleep on the grass;
I have song to spare
    Till the shadows pass.
Day is at the noon,
    No thread of bow or moon;
Rain is in the air,
    Drenched and limp the grass;
I have song to spare
    Till the shadows pass.
Day is at the close,
    Faith no logic knows;
Rain-clouds blur the air,
    All the world is dun;
I have song to spare
    Till to-morrow’s sun."

Kiss,"When Lynne saw the lizard floating
in her mother-in-law’s swimming pool,
she jumped in. And when it wasn’t
breathing, its body limp as a baby
drunk on milk, she laid it on her palm
and pressed one fingertip to its silky breast
with just about the force you need
to test the ripeness of a peach, only quicker,
a brisk little push with a bit of spring in it.
Then she knelt, dripping wet in her Doc Martens
and camo T-shirt with the neck ripped out,
and bent her face to the lizard’s face,
her big plush lips to the small stiff jaw
that she’d pried apart with her opposable thumb,
and she blew a tiny puff into the lizard’s lungs.
The sun glared against the turquoise water.
What did it matter if she saved one lizard?
One lizard more or less in the world?
But she bestowed the kiss of life,
again and again, until
the lizard’s wrinkled lids peeled back,
its muscles roused its own first breath
and she set it on the hot cement
where it rested a moment
before darting off."
My Father. A Tree.,"Today, longing for my father, 
I saw a solitary bleached owl skim 
the dark grasses. It swept so low 
to the ground it might have buried itself. 
I did not know my father so how could I 
be lonely for that guardian?
When I was a newborn, I didn’t let
my father hold me. I cried in his presence
till my mother came. My father would shrug, 
lean into his high backed chair, to read the paper,
to smoke his pipe while he heard his wife
sing to his only daughter. 
In the woods, I summon him
and my eyes fool me as a dark haired
jay shifts a twig, or a stone rolls 
into the creek. I think I hear his footsteps
on the path, but it is only the oak
hip twitching to the afternoon’s cold wind. 
When I was born, he must have felt
the rupture in his chest, dark matter funneling
through his veins, and he must have known 
he would not be here for the rest but he ushered 
me into that brightly lit room, the earth
with all its lumen.
Father, I know you are here, 
the only place you must be, 
where the heavy branches 
lean into bright air.
I put down my sack to eat everything
I have carried with me. When I am done, 
the ants come swarming in to take 
the last of it, to cleanse the earth 
of abundance and discard.
Walking in these woods, I believe
that tall shadows and shifts of light 
mean that something is at work beyond me. 
Midway home and the redwood
are letting go their furious scent,
where you are the tree left standing
and I am this frozen salt flat, 
hemisphere of crushed snow. "

& After the Power Came Back,"for the students  
     The great dead circled the serrated
  hills; they tried to remind you

under fire-forgotten rocks; it was called

        heed & heal.  Maybe you can’t
find it now, but the season
     hauls the wind inside & because 
     you’re a student, you can put

Hiatus,"I give up touch. My hand holds stems 
         of air, while I remember 
         the long hair I wore 
         as a not-girl child. 
 I give up touch to feel 
         safe in a body. How could I be 
         the girl they saw the man 
         I am? Somewhere beyond language 
we are touching 
only the long hair   
of the cool stream 
meeting the lake   
and I remember   
sky when I look down 
into its surface, my face 
only veil, and below, rocks fish   
my shadow. My pulse. Sun and moon 
         set and rise. Everywhere branches 
         tangle. Mist from the lake 
         catches in my beard. Once a butterfly 
         rested there. The moment I said I’m not 
         a flower, she lifted away 
         and I was all bloom.  
What is our essence and who 
         drinks its nectar? A small god 
         surely lives in my throat 
         a kind of temple. I have fed him flesh 
         from the forest floor 
         and he cradles my eyes 
         and he grows me up 
         into the green 
         of trees. I know 
         he’s gold though he’s only ever been 
         visible in dreams. He appears 
         as my mother, childhood 
         pets, a first love, a ghost 
         story whispered over flashlight 
         in a backyard tent, neighbors 
         whose names I’ve lost.   
Here is where I try to hear him.   
Here is where I study how to love him 
         bring him elderberry, oxeye 
         daisy, row of purple 
         foxglove, leopard 
         slug, mock orange, morning 
         glory, mountain lettuce.   
It rains here often. I learn to be water 
in a garden. A handsome solitude is not the same   
as loneliness. It’s here I call my little gold god   
beloved, friend. "

Until they're all converted, every block has a skinny white lady of indeterminate age with an underbite and a cigarette in her right hand swinging as she makes her way down the block. Sometimes this lady organizes the trash in the courtyard in the middle of the night into neat bundles of bulk, bags and recycling. Sometimes this lady screams through the wall that you're a whore and he's a faggot or mumbles under her breath when you pass her in the hallway, the street, the bodega. She wears the same small blue jacket and gray hoodie all winter, face the very image of the moon in Le voyage dans la Lune, space capsule in her
eye. Until they’re replaced,” she may or may not have children, who may or may not be bigger than her, may or may not be wholly or partially white, who indicate some sort of dalliance with boundaries she seems loathe to cross, at least socially, now, and they may or may not also smoke cigarettes, organize the trash or clean the sidewalk, or mumble beneath their breath when you pass. None of them is the super or the super’s family or in any way connected with anything official like the super, but they keep the building, and it's environs, clean, and for this they earn a begrudging respect from their neighbors, until they are gone.
Until the buildings are all filled with white people who have money to spend at cafés and wine bars, and for a little while thereafter, there is, on every block, a black man dressed for all seasons in a camel hair coat, hat with ear flaps, and tattered leather gloves who paces the street speaking to no one In particular in a language no one the neighborhood understands; not Arabic, Spanish, Nahuatl, or English. This man may or may not have a small white dog he pushes in a stroller, he may or may not pull a toddler out of the path of an oncoming car; the ambulance may or may not call at his door repeatedly, the health department may or may
not issue repeated summons. Until they are gone, the people of the block will feed him from the block party proceeds, and the bodega will make of him an honored guest; he may or may not carry a boombox or plastic bag he uses to pick up detritus of the night’s garbage wind and under snow melt remainings. Until he is displaced, he may or may not have a house or apartment, space which is only entered by him, his shopping cart and himself alone, and when he approaches his own threshold his shouts and cries turn to low and coarse offerings at keyholes, punic columns of books in a foyer of grime, until they are gone."

The unnamed flowers in The Rolling Stones song “Dead Flowers.” They grew from the sadness and grief of the singers. They spilled out of Mick Jagger’s and Keith Richards’s mailboxes every morning. They were born singed and curled. They died before the guitars were first plucked.
The daisies, or the Bellis perennis, that sheath Brigitte Bardot’s chest in Plucking the Daisy. They began to die when they were first cut, kept dying as the costume designer sewed them into a bralette, and starved while touching her nipples and the cleft between her breasts. In dying, they taught me about some of my hungers.  
The Maui hau kuahiwi, or Hibiscadelphus wilderianus, of the family of mallows. The murderers came to the island on ships launched from colder seas. Soon, little was left of the lava or the rocks that lava cools into, and nothing was left of the flowers. In the future, there will be a way to conjure the ghosts of these flowers’ smells.
Aside from going to the lab where the scientists create the scents of some dead flowers, or the installations the artists made with the scientists so that many can stand together and feel time and space blossoming, there are other things we can do.
For example, we can imagine. We look at photographs—like “Tree with daffodils” and “Flying insect with flowers,” which we’re sending to you—and watercolor within and outside of their lines to see them in another color, with another shape of petal or an extra stamen. We can dream ourselves into the most plentiful rocks and soils.
The trouble is that the human imagination, we’ve learned, can kill more easily than it can resurrect. 
 "
Marigolds,"Like oak trees swerving out of the hills
And setting their faces to the wind
Day after day being practically lifted away
They are lashed to the earth
And never let go
Gripping on darkness
—Alice Oswald, Memorial
When I picture Robert, he is in the Public Garden,
watching setting suns, like the ill-fated king, turn all to gold.
Robert with the swans. Robert under the statue of Washington.
Robert amid the tulips. Without a childhood
home, I made for myself a house of orchids, of sewer grates
with fishes on them, of forsythia and maple trees.
Of this I am sure: when Robert crossed the bridge
between Boston and Cambridge, he saw Poseidon.
In late summer, he could tell that underneath
the sailboats is a god, mighty and to be feared.
In midwinter, he alone knew the ice
could not long contain that god.
In the pipes in his home, he heard the gurgle of illness.
I smell illness in the riotous orchid blooms.
What are midnight trees?
I think that once I knew one such tree,
if it is the kind owls gather on nightly
to fight, barking,
eyes dim with bloodlust and the hiss of feathers.
I built for myself a house of orchids, with a cave underneath,
a cave shaped into an armory
brimming with tarantula hawks, giant sparrow bees,
and admiral butterflies.
In place of stalactites hang treeless,
inextricable roots.
O sacred receptacle of my joys.
The day I first learned the word argonaut,
I wrote it in a poem. I searched the seas for one.
I searched the skies. I searched a painting.
In the painting, I found the word spears, which I drove slowly
into my father’s ribs. He I eulogized and he I resurrected,
reaching again for the spears. I have seen
countless full moons fail. Each of them hollowed,
flooding heartfirst the craw-faced light, the bracken
underneath. Then, the sound of a wounded owl,
a soft, sudden darkness in my throat. O, how this villainy.
In mourning, the owls are replaced by hawks.
From one angle, broad-winged hawks
seem to have two pairs of hollow eyes.
We are looking for you, say the kettles of satellites
to the humans lost, to the plane
disappeared, to what lives thirty miles below
the surface of Enceladus. On this morning in April,
Haixun 01, Ocean Shield, and HMS Echo hear a thump
that sounds like the colors inside an oyster shell.
The frequency of the noise can make a heart
stop. Anxious as seaweed, over the sides of the ships
creep hordes of trembling locators.
The satellites stare with breath hitching in their throats.
Between the wine-colored hull of Ocean Shield and Enceladus
lies eight times the distance between Earth and the sun.
Thirty miles below the surface of that geyser-ridden, tiger-striped
Saturnian moon lies life, report the satellites.
The hawks steel their two pairs of eyes up
toward alien oceans on other planets.
What I am is all that I can carry, wrote Deborah.
What can I carry? All that I caught I left behind,
all that I missed, I carried.
The hawks are not looking
toward alien oceans. I am.
I am looking, too, to alien men and women.
I picture hurtling into them, by turn, to serve my lust.
I picture us bent sideways, impaled,
contorted and screaming. I picture
the different shades of a moan.
The word bed fills the four eyes in my mind
with the color gold, gold of the ill-fated king
and the Garden sunset, gold glinting in a decaying tooth,
goldenrod, a haze of pollen, the dragon’s treasure,
a long necklace of many fine gold chains
reaching down to a woman’s hips.
Young man walks down to the river
down to the river of gold.
Young man walks down to the river
down to the river and drowns.
In the word bed also joyously wail
bed the color of ashen near death, bed the fleshly color
of bodies broken for good, bed the color blue
of heart-stopped lips. O, here I lift this one hand
up to heaven. The ghosts of the poisoned dogs
live in the piano. The ghost of my mother, still living,
lives in her excised tumor and staghorn kidney stone.
The ghost of my ability to love without grief, still living,
lives in this poem. All my pockets filled with stones
in the river I’ll be found. Why, then, I am the devil’s dam—
dangle me from a cliff, twelve thousand feet above sea.
O, speak with possibilities. Build me a skin
of glass to cover the Grand Canyon,
throw me on it. Summon a thousand wilding mares,
restrain them with massive chains, foot-long links
of hardened steel. When the chains buck
from fracture, let the mares stampede the glass,
bid them trample my body.
Watch, from a great distance, as the glass cracks.
Watch us beasts entangle. Watch me take a hoof
to the mouth. To the skull. To the groin.
Hear us squeal, and bark, and howl,
calling out, as wretches do, to failing life.
When at last we one thousand and one blood-filled creatures
reach the bottom of the Canyon, throw yourself in.
My voice in your ear will tell you that you were meant to die
like this, a beautiful and inelegant dive onto a field of reds,
some bright and sun-kissed, some dark and pulp-dashed,
your and our blood across the burnt-orange schist.
See, O, see what I have done.      
I fear neither the sight of nor the word for blood.
HMAS Albatross has joined the search for the plane.
It is May now, and there is no sign of it.
The detritus lied. The home I made is of orchids,
forsythia, barbed wire, and burnt metal.
In the bedroom I planted what I imagine
a midnight tree to be. Its roots join the treeless roots
in the armory beneath. Ravished, my hands cut off,
my tongue cut out, I put my home under the wisteria,
craving owls at war under thick purple overhang.
No territory there is that is not mine.
The Albatross, it is mine.
Enceladus is mine. Your innermost thigh,
beneath the wisteria, mine.
Poseidon is mine, and the river between Boston and Cambridge,
and the one that wends through Georgia, floods
into the Gulf. I am dreaming of a monument
to moments colonized by theaters of the imagination.
O monstrous. The O of a mouth without a tongue.
The O of two pairs of lips clasped,
starving on one another. Horns and cry of hounds.
The ballet in my deadly standing eye
is the arrow’s flight into the neck, the horses’ tumble into the canyon.
A nation’s search for a single tiger
with quills in its neck. A spilt cloud of felled bees.
The elephant’s horror in the flock of red-billed birds,
feathered locusts who from their first breath form
trembling caverns with their mouths, their aggregate force
snapping branches off trees. The orchestra plays low drumbeats,
a single singer carving the melody.
Do not, I pray, promise me
an untroubled lake. Take me instead
to the rivers with vengeful gods
under steaming and frozen waters.
Take me instead for the stag, the rifle, and the hunter.
Promise me unending days in which I can picture,
then picture again, a fire whirl,
the slowness of the sea drinking
a ferry or a plane, the gasps of air bubbles
around carapaces, the moons of Saturn.
I myself am hells, and I prize them
as if they were the rarest blooms.
Promise me I will always reach again for spears,
await the horses on the glass
above the gaping, hollow O of the earth.
ALL IS LOST. FLEE THIS HOUSE.
So chants James’s Ouija.
or perhaps in the palace of time
our lives are a circular stair and i am turning,
writes Lucille’s ghost-guided hand. Always in my mouth
I hold the head of an axe with its bit at the back
of my throat. O heavens, can you hear a man groan?
Here nothing breeds but we fazed and hungry. O wondrous thing.
Worlds such as this were not thought possible to exist,
writes the astronomer. It is June.
Deep beneath those golden waves
of the river I’ll be found.
My sister has joined the list of those I mourn.
Her ghost lives in each powder-winged moth.
In the ballet, the stage fills with a troupe of dancers in dusty gold skirts,
shoes asphyxiation blue, hair the tones of flesh.
Center stage are six dancers who wear only red,
moving in unison
so they throb as one bloodied yolk.
The troupe around them shudders
as though in blissful death throes.
The single singer quiets. The orchestra
breaks down its instruments.
For my brethren slain
I ask a sacrifice,
O barbarous, beastly villains
like myself.
Die. Die saying please,
die longing, die helpless,
die with your eyes fixed
to the most treacherous side
of a mountain, to newborn stars,
to planes not found.
Die with your throat stuffed,
so that each moment hereafter
is a dream of a gasp.
Die, so that my midnight tree might grow
new branches, die, like a sapling struck by lightning
in an ash-ridden and still smoldering field,
die amid the tulips, die smelling the orchids I grow,
die in the mass of horses in a pied flock of shrieking birds.
From the oceans creatures great and small
take to the land. From the land
each parachuted seed
takes to the sky.
From within my armory
comes a scent melodious and unearthly.
A strain of moths, black, flies as though sewn
each to each at the wing. Their flight path
blooms dark into the gray air
like a print from a silvered glass plate.
Soon we will learn our bodies are formed
of dead stars, so that if we made incisions
from breastbone to rectum, the caves within
would reveal themselves to house celestial ash.
As the stag, I fear the mouth of the rifle.
As the rifle, I point my mouth, deadly, toward you.
As the hunter, I execute myself so I may feast.
Worlds such as this were not thought possible to exist.
My lord, I aim a mile beyond the honeyed moon."
O Spirit,"A bear brings forth her young informous and unshapen.
I now wear the pelt of the conjured beast around my groin.
I think of new words for solace, one of which is knifed.
We take no form until licked into shape by the tongues of those who love us. "
Basic Questions,"      What was the experience of death like for you? 
The fluids within my body failed to be held within my body, which, as far as I can tell, does not entirely differ from some experiences of life, 
      At what moment did you know there was an existence beyond earth? 
as when, for example, I lay beneath another’s beautiful body of my own free will for the first time and learned in one of those staggering moments that I had hairs within my nostrils, 
      How did you feel? 
because they stood on end, as if confused by which hole was meant to receive the body that was on top of me, 
      Were you met by anyone? 
rapt into confusion. I once got to see inside of my own lower abdomen. Did you know there is a galaxy there? I have photographs to prove it.
      What things in our world still attract you most? 
My veins make azalea roots that teem with messages. There are lights whose names I don’t know. Malignancies are moons. There’s gold on the ocean shores. Planets made of other planets, growing into one another to rewrite the old rules about space and about time. I saw it all, through the eye within the eye. Someday, I’ll show you.
      What would you like to clarify for our world about your life? 
Daily existence, mine included, was nothing short of improbable. 
      Do you wish to return again? 
Foucault once wrote, “The venomous heart of things and men is, at bottom, what I’ve always tried to expose.” 
      Is there a message you would like to give to our world? 
Rilke once wrote, “You must change your life.” 
      Is there anything that you wouldn’t mind saying that would help assure your friends that you are you? 
Whatever I have loved, I have taken its name in vain."
Essay on Thunder,"A woman made wary by misfortune, writes Stendhal, will not experience this soul-shaking upheaval. Soul-shaking upheaval means something like what he elsewhere calls the curse of passionate love, although my sense is that love here is better understood as either arousal or torpor, and that distinctions in such matters are, while necessary and true, ultimately mythological. Stendhal’s own argument also entails a critique of terminology: of thunderbolts, he says, That ridiculous word ought to be changed—but nevertheless the thing “love at first sight” does exist. 
When I first copied down those sentences from Stendhal, I wrote instead of upheaval the nonword unheaval, which I now think of as upheaval’s uncompromised sibling. On the ceiling of my gynecologist’s exam room is a watercolor of a lurid hummingbird with a few centimeters of beak inside a flower. A hummingbird’s beak is understood to be a sheath for the bird’s tongue, which means the tongue is a knife. Hummingbirds use their beaks to feed, as well as to do battle. There has not yet been a study of what their tongues do in such times of war. 
 "
Night Questions,"           When does the moon turn full?
When I tell it stories of love.
           When does the moon begin to wane?
When I stop speaking of love.
           What do you look like in the dark?
A horned, lit, and petrified tree on a shore.
           To whom do you turn when in pain?"
Like That,"An enormous snow-covered branch
is threatening the living room.
An enormous tanned branch 
with snow like heaps of table linens
or the clumped, white language of animals
juts into the living room.
A pile of dead oak leaves stands 
in the doorway. If I walk into the room, 
snow will ruin the somber furniture. 
Across the dining room table
and under the cheap glass chandelier,
across the empty space for the Sunday roast
and the doily, my sister, brother and I are cross-country skiing
when a giant embroidered
chickadee
crosses the room
putting a word in my ear."
Wisterical,"The shrieks of children
tumbling in the roaring body of the ocean
                 is glee.
But fill me with dread—glee? the ocean? children?
And the hysterical 
           wisteria. That frantic and purple
                      emissary of the encroaching jungle. 
I think the jungle will win, wind—in the end—its tensile vines
around the throats and raised swords of sun scorched monuments,
collapse the flag poles and balustrades, whatever stakes
           are planted there, will charge
the volition of its green abundance, wild against the wild
                     volition of the frothing ocean. Marry it. What children
will march in that conjugal procession with crowns of kelp
                                             and frantic purple flowers?"
A Winter Twilight,"A silence slipping around like death,
Yet chased by a whisper, a sigh, a breath;
One group of trees, lean, naked and cold,
Inking their cress ’gainst a sky green-gold;
One path that knows where the corn flowers were;
Lonely, apart, unyielding, one fir;
And over it softly leaning down,
One star that I loved ere the fields went brown."
The Winter Bird,"Thou sing’st alone on the bare wintry bough,
As if Spring with its leaves were around thee now;
And its voice that was heard in the laughing rill,
And the breeze as it whispered o’er meadow and hill,
Still fell on thine ear, as it murmured along
To join the sweet tide of thine own gushing song.
Sing on—though its sweetness was lost on the blast,
And the storm has not heeded thy song as it passed,
Yet its music awoke in a heart that was near,
A thought whose remembrance will ever prove dear;
Though the brook may be frozen, though silent its voice,
And the gales through the meadows no longer rejoice,
Still I felt, as my ear caught thy glad note of glee,
That my heart in life’s winter might carol like thee."
So Call it Grace,"The first plea-
sure was,
someday, a man
amen a boy be-
fore this boy
without form
yet here god-
send said god—
send me an-
other portion
of sky ’ipelíikt

For Alain,"On the beach and the beach in Chicago means a more urban situation than I’ve ever
held two children played in sand or I dreamt I was in Malden, seeing what Malden
was, to feel there. I was overweight and swimming in my body. There were other
children in the neighborhood I spent time with each day. We would go in a pack to
the corner store to buy candy. My favorites were a goop I squeezed from a tube and
pastel yellow and blue droplets in a grid on wax. I missed my father. I ate wax in my
impatience. We smashed dry ramen noodles with our hands while the bag was still
closed. We were sealed with the moment. Not looking down from above, not some
feet out ahead but flush with perception. In each music, a trace. My uncle owned a
photography shop near Les Cayes, where he developed film and made shirts and mugs
with people’s faces on them. When he shot himself, no one explained why someone
might do that. Where does anyone get their inspiration? In writer’s block, deep mind
tries to keep surface mind safe, which creates a mutating form of hunger. Something
around the corner. The changeable velocities of thought break barrier. I will not run
until it’s time. My uncle’s mother, the day he died, had heard of his male lover. My
uncle and his wife had just married. They’d conceived a child. My uncle transferred
his remaining funds into his eldest son’s bank account. The present moment can be
your mother, whether or not your mother was trying to hurt you. In Malden, on the
hood of Bob’s car out in front of the house, the phenomenon of clouds moved me.
Decades later, in front of a mirror, I see my body for the first time. A tension behind
my eyes passes, as if my reflection had been made of clay and someone pushed it
into a shape I could see and understand."
Fear and Loathing (Comin’ and Goin’),"                I come to party, I show up alone,
I feel the beat on my feet, and I’m soloing.
I sing sunshine hits in the club.
Sunshine hits baby. That’s just how I live, lawd—
                        And Lord was like—
I fled the scene,
done all I possibly could. The way it works is,
sunshine hits something and so, there is something.
Gradually, you become unlike that something
You used to hold.  I had held a cassette tape
in my hands, had held
a church in my hands,   
had held it with heavy hands, had felt love
Like adrenaline, to which no one in the church spoke.   
I had heard music emanating
from a cassette player, had heard it in church,      
had looked into the pastor’s eyes, had held her eyes   
In my hands, had felt her love like a fee.
                                                       Evil eyes,
everyone knows   
what your poems are about. Whatever it is
got me laughing."
"Martine Syms, Incense, Sweaters, and Ice, 2017, 1:09:00","You are a human being at the club. Driving, texting. You are a nurse in Vegas and enjoyed it. Who are you? What your name is up in the bathroom? The black body routine in front of the mirror, the voice of Eartha Kitt. There’s no races, class, style, refinement, eye contact, elegance, and glamour can get you anywhere. About being an animal lover but also to hunt. In her living room, on TV, someone, a bus driver who saved someone. People eating around a body. Be more in touch with the body. The wind and body are no longer distinct. The body-mind look straight ahead when walking down the street. A voice can speak for herself. She can say no and doesn’t speak for others. How powerful people act? They erect. Powerless people make themselves small. It’s a good idea to try to come across as more powerful lol am I ever gonna see you again or just texts. You’re gonna cry when I’m gone / and it won’t be long. Since feelings are physiology I feel touched and I’m crying in the club. Keep in touch. How are people responding to you? As you change."
Pedal,"I have a friend who measures desire
by stillness, who is most turned on
by the person in the room who meditates
without flinching. The librarian, too,
in the Manuscripts Division, handling
the patron who can’t seem to stay seated
warns: I will serve you the smallest items first
as a knit sweater slides off a chair’s back 
into a loose knot. All day we could have
watched clusters of blue bottle gentians
flexing their umbrellas open and shut
as bumblebees submerged head-first
into one bloom after another,
dizzy subspaces, partially open
paper dressing rooms, trying on things
till they’d wrapped themselves
in a good dusting of pollen. Everywhere
intimate containers seem to be in motion.
The raised bed full of squash flowers.
The black latex glove masking
the bare hand ladling bowls
of wedding soup for the lunch crowd.
My quick pedal revved by the world."

Forever winding
To purple dreaming,
I was the glowing
Of youthful Springtime,
I was the singing
Of golden songbirds,—
        I was love.
            2.
I was the sunlight,
I was the twilight, 
I was the humming
Of winged creatures
    Ere my birth;
I was the blushing
Of lily maiden,
I was the vision
Of youthful striving,
I was the summer,
I was the autumn,
I was the All-time—
      I was love."
Oak Gall Wasp,"Something like a wooden pearl, what gall
forms here, irritation’s
gemstone on the oak-
leaf-underneath I thought was a berry, seed-
case, or oak-faced
scrotum-like excrescence
the oak tree seemed to make of itself
in extremis involved
with power. For no
reason when we were girls plucking these woodland
BBs from the
branch to flick at the back
fence, about so much unsuspecting
I was mistaken by
dissemination
meticulously more single-minded than
the mere widest
distribution of seed
over the furthest expanse; as I
follow American
history, small and
solitary, intravenously driven
living syringe
mainlined into the green
vein of oakleaf to position with
the earthly pulse of her
otherworldly self-
sufficient piercing ovipositor her
shimmering eggs,
the oak gall wasp is un-
American mother of the year.
Patriotism, meet
parasitism;
a biochemical je ne sais quoi charms the
redirection
of the oakleaf’s force to
form a cradle for each minuscule
egg something like the way
our human flesh scabs
over. And not just any oak—oak gall wasps
overtaking
an oak known as your own
are implicit in every acorn,
including the sprouting
one you carried home
rolling slowly around the base of a wet
Dixie Cup your
first grade teacher told you
would, with patience, be as tall as you
one day, and capable
in time of crushing
you in bed, unsentimental consequence
of gravity
which is a consequence
of the curvature of spacetime, but
what isn’t? I sold the
house behind which my
son and I once planted such an acorn and
even enclosed
it in a pathetic
ring of prefabricated fencing
I fought counter-clockwise
against the coil to
unspool off a metal roll like a robot
fabric bolt to
shield it from the orphan
fawns. If that oak rises still, witness
to the sleep of someone
else’s child now through
an underestimated August storm, I
do not know, or
in what health, but if rise
it does, safe in her hyperbaric
chamber, as athlete gods
sleep between stages
on the tour de France, there the gall wasp grows in
my divestment.
Such a fundamental
hunger stirs in the oak gall dark, if
you listen you might hear
her chew her way out
of oakleaf where she incubates encrypted
in her first meal.
Unless—and this is life
on earth, as much a miracle of
drudgery and lust as
you or me or the
gall wasp— another even more strategic
parasitic-
to-the-second power
brood parasite wasp oak-injects with
finer, more exacting
ovipositor,
a second egg. The two sister together
in the waspworld
prenatal ritual
juices, downloading the vital re-
directed principles
of oak into their
maturing, crackling bodies. You’ve been to sleep-
overs; girls grow
strong touching each other’s
bodies with stories of mutual
incrimination. What
confidence betrayed
then when duplicitous behind her back. To
emerge, as we
learned, wasps chew their exit
through the gall; but in the case of a
hosting wasp, she’s compelled
to stop by something
that most entomologists don’t read enough
Victorian
novels to understand.
Whether social dynamics are more
or less legible to
an outsider, I’m
too far inside the gall to tell, since it was
I who dug the
hole, placed the acorn, shooed
the beast, and waited for the oak to
leaf that the gall wasp could
deposit there her
egg inspiring thus the oak to cradle it
that a second
wasp could parasitize
the parasite wasp—as is drawn out
over several seasons
of elaborate
out-maneuverings in parish, parlor, and
palace on the
BBC. But this is
an American transition of 
power. Don’t look away.
I don’t want to end
this poem bleeding but the wasp does eat the
wasp, and up through
the top of her head like
the goddess she is, enters the hell-
scape. It’s happening now;
it happened. Unless,
that is, through the bedroom window where sleeps the
child of someone
else now, the beautiful
oak I tenderly tended alread- 
y crashed."
O Small Sad Ecstasy of Love,"I like being with you all night with closed eyes.
What luck—here you are
coming
along the stars!
I did a road trip
all over my mind and heart
and
there you were
kneeling by the roadside
with your little toolkit
fixing something.
Give me a world, you have taken the world I was."
Rust Honey,"I knew for years the archaic term for refrain—
               the part of the song you carry—
is burden. It carries you. Refrain, also, as in
               hold back. The burden holds me back.
If I didn’t have you, my father said, passing
               the fire, I’d get out to help. It made me
imagine people inside. I lived instead.
               Burden, I learned, after the bees began
producing rust-honey in their rust-wax
               hives, is also what you feed
into the blast furnace. A burden of rust-honey,
               into the furnace shaft. The slag
is gummy. It sounds impossible. It’s also
               dull. The house kept burning and we ran
for help. It means we’d stopped to watch.
               It sounds impossible. It’s also dull.
Tenderly, though, his running desperate, 
               yet matching his steps to the child’s. 
A sweet smell in the tetanus."
The Ruins of Nostalgia 59,"We felt nostalgic for libraries, even though we were sitting in a library. We looked around the library lined with books and thought of other libraries we had sat in lined with books and then of all the libraries we would never sit in lined with books, some of which contained scenes set in libraries.   *   We felt nostalgic for post offices, even though we were standing in a post office. We studied the rows of stamps under glass and thought about how their tiny castles, poets, cars, and flowers would soon be sent off to all cardinal points. We rarely got paper letters anymore, so our visits to the post office were formal, pro forma.   *   We felt nostalgic for city parks, even though we were walking through a city park, in a city full of city parks in a country full of cities full of city parks, with their green benches, bedraggled bushes, and shabby pansies, cut into the city. (Were the city parks bits of nature showing through cutouts in the concrete, or was the concrete showing through cutouts in nature?)   *   We sat in a café drinking too much coffee and checking our feeds, wondering why we were more anxious about the future than anxiously awaiting it. Was the future showing through cutouts in the present, or were bits of the present showing through cutouts in a future we already found ourselves in, arrived in our café chairs like fizzled jetpacks? The café was in a former apothecary lined with dark wood shelves and glowing white porcelain jars labeled in gilded Latin, which for many years had sat empty. Had a person with an illness coming to fetch her weekly dose of meds from one of the jars once said to the city surrounding the shop, which was no longer this city, Stay, thou art so fair? Weren’t these the words that had sealed the bargainer’s doom? Sitting in our presumptive futures, must we let everything run through our hands—which were engineered to grab—into the past? In the library, in the post office, in the city park, in the café, in the apothecary... o give us the medicine, even if it is a pharmakon—which, as the pharmacist knows, either poisons or heals—just like nostalgia. Just like the ruins of nostalgia."
Villanelle,"How dreary the winds shriek and whine:
    The trembling shadows grow chill. 
O soul of my soul, wert thou mine!
O where are the stars that did shine?
    The moonlight that tinselled the hill?
How dreary the winds shriek and whine! 
Despair ’round my heart doth entwine,
    Far soundeth my cry weird and shrill:
O soul of my soul, wert thou mine!
I’ve quaffed to the dregs the mad wine 
    Of passion, but under my sill
How dreary the winds shriek and whine!
’Tis thine, is the dream so divine, 
    That doth this vain yearning instill; 
O soul of my soul, wert thou mine!
’Tis mine, here to crave and to pine
   For what thou wilt never fulfill;
How dreary the winds shriek and whine!
O soul of my soul, wert thou mine! "
To God our twice-Revenger,"We saw, but oh! how sad were we to see,
Spains (prouder) Fleete on the proud Ocean spred:
An hundred ships there were, and eight times three.
Which made it deem’d and nam’d unconquered.
   The ancient Pilots were amaz’d to see’t,
   When they beheld this new-huge-bodied Fleete.
The Sea with mazed smile saw in her bounds,
All the Earths wealth and honor brought by ships,
But we all trembled at the frequent sounds
Of Trumpets, Drummes: at naked Swords and Whips,
   (Sore threatned) wherewith all the Spaniard fell,
   Came arm’d this Brittaine nation to quell.
Our hopes are in alone-torne Ship (befitted,
With fire and Brimstone as her chiefest loade)
Shee, without guide, is to the winds committed,
And forth with cruel destiny she roade;
   (Them and her self with her own flames to spoile)
   Winds serve; she burnt her self, put them to foile.
Here were we cheer’d to see the Ocean maine,
All white before with Sails, now purple growne.
As suddenly with bloud of Spaniards slain:
Their fleete is scatted, and their Ships o’re thrown:
   Some sink, some burn I’ th’ Sea, and some at last,
   After long wandring, on strange Shores are cast.
We saw, but oh! how glad were we to see,
O cruel Rome, out of thy darksome den,
So many weapons of thy villanie
And mightie engines, pluckt by hands of men?
   Stones, Faggots, Crows, Gun-powder tubs we saw,
   These wines The whore doth from her vessels draw.
Long were they hid under the secret vaulte,
Of that great house; and there they were to lye,
Till they were made (O horrible assault!)
By wicked Faux his hand, aloft to flye.
   Those sacred rooms where Laws were wont to breed,
   To sudden wrack and ruine were decreed.
King Prince, Peers, Prelates, Commons, Gospel bright,
All at one blow together were to fall:
Match was in hand to give the Trains their light,
But God reveal’d, destroy’d, reveng’d them all.
   Hell needs not blush: for this Impiety
   Doth worst of men, fiends furies justifie.
Hell never knew such wickedness as this,
Another Hell (like it there need a’-bin.
Should Plot and pay be like? for both there is
One measure: none of pay; for, none of sinne.
   Should praise be like Gods grace? there is but one
   Measure for both: Grace had, praise must have none!"
"Hickory Street, New Orleans","Like, the last thing I said to you was let’s buy a duplex,
like, you live on your side & I’ll live on my side &
you’ll rise when you rise & I’ll rise when I rise &
I said something like, let’s divide these hurts & regrets
& you get a stack & I get a stack & you walk a block
& I walk a block & you get a poodle & I get a pug
& you stub a toe & I twist an ankle & you get
a wheelbarrow & I get chickens glazed with rain
& you interrupt & I intercept & you call
the Congressman & I call the Mayor & you blow
a trumpet & I smash a tuba or maybe seal off all sound 
sheltering the shuddering of the heart compressed
the high-pitched operas of trolley wheels breaking
at the edge of midnight where magnolias
shelter the stoplights & left-footed lovers, drunk 
on beignets & champagne-kisses & maybe struck
by the distant drift of a giant
sea turtle floating toward a green wave
in a tacky, overpriced painting
& somehow they’re safe, the couple is safe
& there’s no parade stilts that will break, no stars
that will bend, there’s just an orchid
tucked behind an ear & hours blurred together

Wild Grapes,"What tree may not the fig be gathered from?
The grape may not be gathered from the birch?
It's all you know the grape, or know the birch.
As a girl gathered from the birch myself
Equally with my weight in grapes, one autumn,
I ought to know what tree the grape is fruit of.
I was born, I suppose, like anyone,
And grew to be a little boyish girl
My brother could not always leave at home.
But that beginning was wiped out in fear
The day I swung suspended with the grapes,
And was come after like Eurydice
And brought down safely from the upper regions;
And the life I live now's an extra life
I can waste as I please on whom I please.
So if you see me celebrate two birthdays,
And give myself out of two different ages,
One of them five years younger than I look-
One day my brother led me to a glade
Where a white birch he knew of stood alone,
Wearing a thin head-dress of pointed leaves,
And heavy on her heavy hair behind,
Against her neck, an ornament of grapes.
Grapes, I knew grapes from having seen them last year.
One bunch of them, and there began to be
Bunches all round me growing in white birches,
The way they grew round Leif the Lucky's German;
Mostly as much beyond my lifted hands, though,
As the moon used to seem when I was younger,
And only freely to be had for climbing.
My brother did the climbing; and at first
Threw me down grapes to miss and scatter
And have to hunt for in sweet fern and hardhack;
Which gave him some time to himself to eat,
But not so much, perhaps, as a boy needed.
So then, to make me wholly self-supporting,
He climbed still higher and bent the tree to earth
And put it in my hands to pick my own grapes.
'Here, take a tree-top, I'll get down another.
Hold on with all your might when I let go.'
I said I had the tree. It wasn't true.
The opposite was true. The tree had me.
The minute it was left with me alone
It caught me up as if I were the fish
And it the fishpole. So I was translated
To loud cries from my brother of 'Let go!
Don't you know anything, you girl? Let go!'
But I, with something of the baby grip
Acquired ancestrally in just such trees
When wilder mothers than our wildest now
Hung babies out on branches by the hands
To dry or wash or tan, I don't know which,
(You'll have to ask an evolutionist)-
I held on uncomplainingly for life.
My brother tried to make me laugh to help me.
'What are you doing up there in those grapes?
Don't be afraid. A few of them won't hurt you.
I mean, they won't pick you if you don't them.'
Much danger of my picking anything!
By that time I was pretty well reduced
To a philosophy of hang-and-let-hang.
'Now you know how it feels,' my brother said,
'To be a bunch of fox-grapes, as they call them,
That when it thinks it has escaped the fox
By growing where it shouldn't-on a birch,
Where a fox wouldn't think to look for it-
And if he looked and found it, couldn't reach it-
Just then come you and I to gather it.
Only you have the advantage of the grapes
In one way: you have one more stem to cling by,
And promise more resistance to the picker.'
One by one I lost off my hat and shoes,
And still I clung. I let my head fall back,
And shut my eyes against the sun, my ears
Against my brother's nonsense; 'Drop,' he said,
'I'll catch you in my arms. It isn't far.'
(Stated in lengths of him it might not be.)
'Drop or I'll shake the tree and shake you down.'
Grim silence on my part as I sank lower,
My small wrists stretching till they showed the banjo strings.
'Why, if she isn't serious about it!
Hold tight awhile till I think what to do.
I'll bend the tree down and let you down by it.'
I don't know much about the letting down;
But once I felt ground with my stocking feet
And the world came revolving back to me,
I know I looked long at my curled-up fingers,
Before I straightened them and brushed the bark off.
My brother said: 'Don't you weigh anything?
Try to weigh something next time, so you won't
Be run off with by birch trees into space.'
It wasn't my not weighing anything
So much as my not knowing anything-
My brother had been nearer right before.
I had not taken the first step in knowledge;
I had not learned to let go with the hands,
As still I have not learned to with the heart,
And have no wish to with the heart-nor need,
That I can see. The mind-is not the heart.
I may yet live, as I know others live,
To wish in vain to let go with the mind-
Of cares, at night, to sleep; but nothing tells me
That I need learn to let go with the heart."
Real Estate,"My mother married a man who divorced her for money. Phyllis, he would say, If you don’t stop buying jewelry, I will have to divorce you to keep us out of the poorhouse. When he said this, she would stub out a cigarette, mutter something under her breath. Eventually, he was forced to divorce her. Then, he died. Then she did. The man was not my father. My father was buried down the road, in a box his other son selected, the ashes of his third wife in a brass urn that he will hold in the crook of his arm forever. At the reception, after his funeral, I got mean on four cups of Lime Sherbet Punch. When the man who was not my father divorced my mother, I stopped being related to him. These things are complicated, says the Talmud. When he died, I couldn’t prove it. I couldn’t get a death certificate. These things are complicated, says the Health Department. Their names remain on the deed to the house. It isn’t haunted, it’s owned by ghosts. When I die, I will come in fast and low. I will stick the landing. There will be no confusion. The dead will make room for me."
Elegy for the Disappeared,"Though no word called me, I looked again. 
Each wave of supposition hammered against the black wall. 
Sometimes meaning, like an expiration date, is blurred. 
Then emptiness takes a bow, extending its invitation. 
Like that interval between the performance and the bravos. 
What was there before it dropped away? Was there ever anything beyond this lingering, felt presence? 
Erosional debris piles up in a rift valley. 
As the world pours into me, I pour into the broken word. 
Suggestions, you come to realize, will be dispensed in installments. The poor and the brutalized. A prayer bruise. 
If letters act as synapses, you become a neurotransmitter, conducting the message between them. Trans latus. Carried across. A form of translation. 
But what detonation blew these letters apart? 
Caesura: a gap between words. Mind the gap. 
Yet it’s precisely what’s missing that beckons us. 
When we read, what transpires but a yearning between letters? 
The b is all that’s left of bitterness. The p introduces pain. 
Like opening the door only to be handed a summons. 
Where the house previously stood, now a wind blows. 
Though its first and last plank held, the bridge plunged into the ravine. Given up, left behind with a terrible longing. 
Or thrown overboard and drowned in the middle passage. 
The p and b are testaments of survivors. 
The bodies of letters lying apart from their trauma. 
Cells on opposite sides of a wound draw near and begin to merge. Phantom limb. Though what is absent speaks. 
As I imagine what is nowhere to be found, my own substance grows porous, my life more elusive. 
A glyph, a provocation, and you respond. Art blossoms in the mind. Hey abyss, you still don’t possess all of me. 
Bringing about this call and response. 
How to cure a phantom limb with a mirror? Let yourself see what is there.

Wild Turkey,"Not the bottle
Not the burn on the lips
lit throat glow
Not even wild     really
but a small-town bird
whose burgundy throat
shimmers like nothing ever
A huge bird    impressive
who lurches and stalks me
window to window in this
desert retreat
What does he want?
Clearly he is lonely
pecks his reflection
and speaks to it in a low gubble
(not gobble) gubbles so tenderly
Soon as I think of him     his eye hits on me
We have watched each other for days
His shifting colors fascinate me  his territorial strut
But it is his bald and blue-red head
his old man habits and gait that move me
If I even think of him        I taste whiskey
Drunk on solitude    I’d talk to anybody
I try his language on my lips
His keen response burns     like shame"
Red Language,"If I heard the words you once used
in our wild place rough with scrub roses
in sand—if your words came back
gray and kind as mild winter
believe me I’d still understand
offer my own red language
my tongue to your tongue
so we recall what we once said
that made us live
                        made us choose to live"
Dear Demeter—Dear Earth (where Hades is the non-custodial parent),"First     in the dark world of a crying child

all the love he can wring from
a small     terrified     being 
Then     when the shining child smiles
and the damned underworld is seen
dank and relentless    for what it is
he will see that you invented fire
He will see you kindled     with your body
an illuminated being         a soul devoted
a bright likeness of the father     
He will love you    He will bless you
He will try to         make you His"

The Thought of the World,"This is how a country goes bad.
Reason does not govern
The social order, in the Republic.

The old philosophers thought reason
If spoken plainly could alter
The governing order of the world.

Was it a comfort to believe
That someone held the Word
In their mind to establish
The world beyond thinking

The world on the ground
Upheld and upholding
The mind in its cottage
The thought of the world

Apart from the mind
Stable of immortal horses?

And the long disputations of Abelard... 
What was the discourse?

What was the virtue of speech
Had there not been a world
To uphold and a mind to think
Of worlds that were not itself

The mind echoing the outside
Creak of tree-frogs at night—
The window and witness—
To tell the story of what it saw?

Was there never a song
A dogma close to Paradise
Worthy of our tenderness?

Were the tongues always 
Deceived and the spoils 
Bestowed by conquerors
The purchase of blindness?

On the wall is the writing
By hand of the last poet
To leave the last city behind.
Her words are calligraphy.

The drawing made by them
The letters of the writing
What it says is that here
A hand once made a mark.
  O liberty to write your precious
Freedom like a faulty wire.

Through the window the maple trees
Shining and swaying.

Lights sputter as the hand moves.

Well then, to write dark letters
On dark pages in the dark hall.
It matters that the words hold on
And the meanings cling like iron."
Sonnets from the Cherokee (III),"What is this nameless something that I want,
Forever groping blindly, without light,—
A ghost of pain that does forever haunt
My days, and make my heart eternal night?
I think it is your face I so long for,
Your eyes that read my soul at one warm glance;
Your lips that I may touch with mine no more
Have left me in their stead a thrusting lance
Of fire that burns my lips and sears my heart
As all the dreary wanton years wear through
Their hopeless dragging days. No lover’s art
Can lift full, heavy sorrow from my view
Or still my restless longing, purge my hate,
Because I learned I loved you, dear, too late. "
At The Dinner Table With God And My Father,"What happens when God sits down for dinner?
Do you set the table for two, three or four?
What happens if you only have a loaf of bread
and a one-pound block of butter,
do you ask him to perform a miracle?
What do you do when God puts his hands on the table,
fingers flay, bull and lamb belly up, pink-red palms
asking for forgiveness?
What happens to forgiveness when God is your father
and you discover he’s just a man with two hands—
can a bull and a lamb be still on the tines of a fork?
Or are they votive candles burning on the altar of your plate?
Those paraffin hands, waxwing feathers in prayer.
How else can hope look
if not like a spoon to your lips, a sparrow
with new wings
beating air from the comfort of its perch?
This is how we move forward,
             you unclasp your hands and surrender flight
                          before you pick up the butter knife."
Catfish Frantic,"and a father with a fishing pole | five starving children |
two sisters at home and a brother in rehab | little sister at the shore
glove to hold fish | hook in the mouth | desperate
& hungry | father never taught us how to gut fish ||
And so we eat the fish whole
And raw
Our children picking barbs from inside their cheeks"
Of Things and Home,"Where else do mice scurry along the bones of a couch,
among coiled springs and dog food stash, where
a body is wrapped up in quilts because October
is a cold house, no hot water but a dog’s water dish
frozen in the dark living room where a body is wrapped
         up in quilts,
no food except a couple cans of commod beef stew,
a grocery store across the street, lingering
in the parking lot, two payphones and no one to call
because October is an empty house, a month
abandoned of light bills and mother
a quilt of frayed threads and father pulling at the threads
of another weeklong binge.
Where else can a body have a husk and still feel
                                                 like the rib cage of a mouse
brittle and starved
but stashing
buttons or dog food or threads from a quilt,
                                                 a skeleton
among skeletons
             of things we don’t miss."
Psych Ward Visitation Hour,"For 7 days and 7 nights, I’ve been shooting free throws
           The doctor said I needed focus
There is no net because some guy tried hanging himself from it
           But the moonlight betrayed him
In the courtyard where we sit, a dandelion grows
           I see you’re uncomfortable. Ignore these
blood-brick walls, cemented ground, nurse station window
          There’s forgiveness here. And I need to apologize
You’re seeing me in these weed-green scrubs, bone-cloth robe
           I unscrewed the roof from our home
                       swallowed all the memories
Did I tell you the cops wrote “superficial cuts” in their report?
          They didn’t understand when I said
I needed something red. They didn’t understand when I said
           I needed to paint my chest vermillion
I’m scared to go home. Have I told you that?
           I’ve always been
I keep having a nightmare where my hands grow into copper antlers
           I keep having this nightmare where I hold
                       a dandelion in one hand, a robin in the other
I made you something during craft hour. A paint-by-numbers thing
          Two deer in a winter forest full of birch trees
                       Look, a tiny spot of orange. Hunter orange
Blaze orange. See the buck? His antlers are still velvet
          See how strong he’s standing?      No, wait
                       his right front leg is soft on the ground.       No
He’s not standing, he’s kneeling. Only,
          He’s not kneeling
                       He’s fallen. Notice
There’s only one deer now and he’s still
          His tongue juts from the corner of his mouth
                       His eyes are focused on me
Wait, his head is missing. The antlers are gone.  Everything
          Is gone. There’s a bright streak
                       of red screaming across the snow 
There are only shadows now and boot prints. There’s only snow
          I made you something during craft hour
                       A cheap paint-by-numbers rip-off of O’Keeffe
A forest of birch trees but the math of it all didn’t make sense
         So I painted the numbers blank, then left
                       I couldn’t focus so I went and shot free throws
I thought about the man who tried hanging himself
         How afraid he must have been about going home
                      That dandelion is his ghost. His head
A thousand yellow florets, burning. The sun
         Never felt so good. I’m glad you’re here."
"I Cast It Away, My Body:","after Georgia O’Keeffe’s First Drawing of Blue Lines, 1916
Because two brothers make a body where none existed
God drew two bodies as one went crooked
There is a war between us. And I am losing
My brother, fabulous night panther & copper-horned
Struck by lightning, electric blue: two lines
My father pulls two ribs and one snaps into angles
In the waiting room, a body begins to fold in on itself
A body begins to pull a breathing tube from out of itself
There is a war between us. And I am losing
My brother, all copper feathers and dragon tail, chosen
In the mud of a battlefield, you’ll find my heart
Buried in the soft red clay, my body
Broke and anchored to this earth, a bolt
Jettisoned, my brother is my father’s first son"
On the Backs of American Bison,"Some dreams come ill, a bad kidney or two
maybe three. But no crow mourns for lost feathers.
A magpie might. Black and white and able to recognize its own reflection.
Black-billed Narcissus. Vain bird that you are.
Sensitive corvid. My mother used to call me a magpie.
In her poems, I was left for days in a bundle,
when my parents returned, they learned I had flown away
to the back of a nearby bison. What’s more American?
Here, the food was plentiful until they killed all the bison.
I had to find a new home, build a nest in riparian woodland.
With the wolves sitting around me, I told them my life.
They regurgitated new stories for me to dream.
While they weren’t looking, I’d steal their food
I’m a sensitive corvid after all. We have to survive somehow."
No More Fire Here: A Sestina,"O’ King build me more templar
more handsome and muscular.
Build me a chest made of barley fire.
Set it ablaze each morning for sunlight.
Build me legs quick as a chariot,
light as a doe’s, strong as a current runs through a river. It
must all mean something if I am the third son of my father. It
must all mean something if my body is a ravaged temple.
What does it mean if his body is a ravaged temple? Wretched chariots
we carry burdened with copper and birch bark inside muscled
and fatty hearts. Siken wrote about bodies being possessed by light,
I should have known those antlers were never copper but always fire.
Your tongue always tasted of fire.
The ash of it.
The lie of it. But one hundred legs of running men leaves me light
around the temples.
I have a weakness for muscular.
I have a brain full of char rioting
in an underwater circus. I hold my breath as his chariot
is unplugged from the wall. The immediate silence. No more fire
here. I wanted you to be muscular
and fit, healthy as an ox. The attraction I feel for it.
We can only build the most modest of temples
when all we have is moonlight.
Moonlit / chariot / racing toward a temple
fire / The idea of it / muscular
I’ve always loved Absalom, not because he’s handsome and muscular
but because he had the King’s heart. Let there be light.
Let it / arrive in a horse-drawn carriage.
Let it arrive as fire.
O’ King build my body a temple,
make my heart more corpuscular than muscular. Make me a chariot
light of ire.
It's so lonely and cold inside this scalpel-ruined templum."
Sara in Her Father’s Arms,"Cell by cell the baby made herself, the cells
Made cells. That is to say
The baby is made largely of milk. Lying in her father’s arms, the little seed eyes
Moving, trying to see, smiling for us
To see, she will make a household
To her need of these rooms—Sara, little seed,
Little violent, diligent seed. Come let us look at the world
Glittering: this seed will speak,
Max, words! There will be no other words in the world
But those our children speak. What will she make of a world
Do you suppose, Max, of which she is made."
My Sister Teaches Me How to Ululate,"Yallah habibti, move your tongue like the sea
easy. My big sister teaches me to ululate, rolls
her tongue in waves. Dips thin fingers inside
my mouth to pull out mine, stretches it long
and pinches the tip. Watch, we move tongues
like this. I see the walls of our father’s house
collapse and we swim free leleleleleleleleleee
On the ferry to Tangier I shriek across the sea.
Practice how to sound like a real woman. Old
aunties grab my buttocks, smush their breasts
against my back and sing leleleleleleleleleleeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
Don’t cover your mouth habibti! Only women
on the upper deck, only sea. We move tongues
like this to tell the waves stay back, tell men
stay back, tell the dead stay gone, tell runaway
wives stay gone. They turn me into wisteria
woman, limbs wrapped around poles and thighs
as they guide me. Throw back your head, epiglottis
to the breeze. Salt air burns my hot membranes,
scratches at the tight knots of my chords.
All my life I was told
women must swallow sand 
unless we are sounding
a warning."
When The Patient Asked For A White Doctor,"Her temple smeared across my walls,
I bowed beneath her stream.
Two arcs of piss & bloody vomit
shot inside the MRI machine.
The half-moon rolled back and she
emerged beneath me. My: too much
brown, too much blush, too many
lashes to heal, rattled loose in a split
mouth like crack rocks. She spewed
a bloody history: my people, her father,
some agony at the West Midlands Area
Conservative Society. When she groaned
Ain’t No Black In The Union Jack,
I tempered the pain—oxycodone
for one, high grade the other, ditched
my beeper in her cradle. Switched scrubs
for straps & animal skins in the back seat
of an Audi TT. I saged my hair with a blunt.
Danced away her ruin beneath a black
girl’s melody."
Random Thoughts of Her,"I gaze into her eyes—their tender light,
And strong, illumes my spirit's darkest night,
And pours rich glory on me as a star
Which brings its silver luster from afar.
Sweet thoughts and beautiful within me burn,
And heaven I see what way soe’er I turn;
In borrowed radiance of her soulful glance
All things grow tenfold lovely and entrance.
I touch her willing hand—as gentle dove
It rests within my own, in trusting love;
And yet it moves me with a power so deep,
My heart is flame, and all my pulses leap.
I breathe her name unto the flowers: they bloom
With rarer hues, and shed more rich perfume!
The skylark hears it, as he floats along,
And adds new sweetness to his morning song.
Oh magic name! deep graven on my heart,
And, as its owner, of myself a part!
It hath in all my daily thoughts a share,
And forms the burden of my nightly prayer!"
It was Snowing on the Monuments,"It was snowing on the monuments
My dead father’s name next to my living mothers
You went further back into the cemetery
There where so many lies remain lost to winter
There with the named and the nameless
It was snowing on the monuments
All horizons packed with cloud cover
bodies
Some of us left in the vehicles
We came in
Some became some final gesture
Of departure’s sun borne reflect
behind auto glass
heat blowing feeling back into a face
It was snowing on the monuments
Even in the warmth of an engine turning over
You must forget how we came to this place
How we leave
A procession of memory
an immersion in going away
music
Voices of older songs already
In the broken gone
As some wheel turns us back
Onto a gray road"
Polar Night,"Maybe if you could see yourself
from a distance
you could see what people see
when they see you close up
they can see the canaries and the penguins
and the darts flying through air,
like missiles above a city
only the trajectory is all wrong.
Only the sonnet is wrong,
and the signature on the dotted line,
a pool of light in the puddle
at the bottom of the well.
Maybe if you abandoned the song
and the tubes of the radio went dead
you would rub the hands of a stranger
in the storm.
You would lie on a mattress
with broken springs and take your
swings with your foot
in a bucket.
If you close your eyes tight you
might recognize me if I touch
your skin. The tattoo of a flower
in the shape of a heart."
New Travelogue,"I stumbled out of the bushes
to see a deer drink from a pool.
I climbed into the hills above
Berkeley, one step at a time.
I went to Prince Edward Island
where Anne of Green Gables’ face
is on the license plate. A hawk
or a condor flew over our house.
I bought a carton of smokes
at the duty free shop in Anchorage.
Took a seconal in Frankfurt
and woke up in New York.
I bothered my friends with my troubles;
I was never (not) alone. I postponed
pleasure until it was almost gone.
I stared out over the North Sea,
waiting for rain. I wandered
through the red light district in Amsterdam
in the middle of night. I rode on
the back of a motorcycle over a mountain
on Christmas Eve.
I floated on my back in the ocean
at Maui. Stared out the window of
my hotel room over the rooftops of
Florence. Took LSD in Paris and sat
on a bench in the Luxembourg Gardens.
Rented a hotel room in Liverpool
but couldn’t sleep.
I missed my flight from Madrid to Lisbon.
Found an apartment on the Panhandle
and drank tea in Golden Gate Park.
I was caught stealing at Safeway—I could never
return. A Chinese acupuncturist came to
my house when I threw out my back
and couldn’t move. I woke up in an apartment
on 5th Street and listened to the roosters
crow on someone’s roof. I visited her
in her house overlooking the ocean and she
let me in. I put out my hand to touch you,
but the bed was empty.
I wheeled a stroller down an icy New
England street. Waited under a canopy
in the rain, but she never came. I stood
in front of a classroom with paint stains
on my shoes. Called the suicide hotline,
but no one answered.
I dropped everything I was doing
and ran into the street. Drove
a car with faulty transmission until
a fire started under the hood. I ate
Indian food on a balcony in Capetown.
I sang karaoke in a bar in Tibet.
Something I meant to say comes back
to haunt me in my sleep. I turn
the key in the lock and call your
name. Her face appears, out of nowhere,
making a shadow on the page. There’s
only one stone and it weighs a ton."
The New Testament,"Sometimes only a loincloth
covers the lower part
of his body but no one is
telling him that nakedness
is a sin, or a lie, no one is lying
to him, or lying beside him
in the dark, removing the loin-
cloth or fig leaf from the lower
half. There are dogs
barking outside the sandwich
bar, and a parrot is on display in
the lobby of the Marriott, locked
in a cage for everyone to see.
If I could see in the dark
I would tell you the difference
between the animal and the vegetable,
the nameless and the virginal, those
who rove the streets and estuaries,
their limbs exposed to the elements,
and those who stay at home behind
gated windows and tinted glass."
Nocturne,"It’s possible you can see someone from
A distance, after all these years, and stop in your
Tracks or do a double take and wonder if maybe
It’s just someone who looks like someone
You used to know or if it’s the real person and
Then you walk on by like in the song “Walk
On By” and then you turn turn again but the person’s
Gone and all you can do is haul yourself
Up to the roof and jump off or shoot yourself
In the foot so that you can’t walk can’t move
And time hangs heavy as you sit in your room
And wonder if that person was him or you
Or someone’s twin who arrived from another
Planet to savor the lilac scent that radiates
From your skin
And the heat comes up from the pipes like Les
Trois Gymnopédies by Erik Satie and I turn the key
Without biting my tongue and the heart comes
Back on until it bleeds and I take back with one
Hand what I gave with the other and someone
Comes in off the street no longer invisible
And the kissing booth closes for the night—too
Bad for you—and I display my dishrag abs to
The wind one last time, feel my skin on fire
As I descend"
Dance Practice,"Fannie Akpik
leads her dance group
at the high school hallway in Utqiagvik.
Voice
clear as a loon's call,
tender
as the warm center of the lagoon where dreams come to surface.
Songs erupted from the Qargi,
flash in the dark,
piece of the moon bitten off,
landing at the tip of the drum stick.
Sealgut covering of prayers
whirring like wind slipping into tied-up hoods.
Whalers come home
to their Elders' voices,
their hands that shape sod and clear snowy pathways,
enunciating real people sounds that shiver
on the tunnel between the heart and throat."
Lie,"That’s us: the bruise on my thigh, a Camel
dangling from your beautiful mouth
and this our favorite wedding picture. The vows:
      (1) Do I take thee Wife
as wedge against the fear
of sleeping alone
in Southeast Asia?
      (2) Do I take thee Husband as solace
for all the girls ever wanted? For the ones kissed
and held by and held.
Twenty years later I am queer as
a happy Monday and you dead from cancer—
lung or liver, I no longer know
anyone to ask and made up the cause, cancer 
I say, because the paper said you died at home.
And that there was a child after besides the one before
and nothing to mark the one 
we washed away.
I dream of her sometimes, little toothless sack of skin.
with something, nothing, something 
swimming inside. 
                                     But more often
I dream of a house I once lived in,
a certain room, a street, its light. I wake 
trying to remember which country, 
what language. Not the house
where we lived and its bodies.
How they come and go
late at night, nearly dawn. I am making 
crepes and coffee and the group from the bar 
can’t believe their luck.
What did we talk about? I am trying to remember
and not trying to remember
how I tried or never tried to love you."
More Than Something Else,"Something Else.
Some one else
Some where else
That place is here,
In my home,
We are here.
I am brown,
Brown hair,
Brown eyes,
Like cookies Feather tells me, and I like to think it’s perfectly
cooked Pueblo cookies.
My kids are something else,
9 different shades of brown,
All beautiful.
My grandkids are something else,
4 brown eyes, 2 blue eyes,
All Native,
Definitely something else, as I watch them be rowdy, be loving,
be here in this world.
We are here
On this earth
In this time and place
In our homes,
On our lands,
In the cities,
With our families, laughing loudly, cooking together, protecting
each other.
We are something else
With our songs
Our dances.
We pray with corn meal,
Eagle feathers,
Medicine bundles,
Burn some sage, make sure to acknowledge the four directions,
as the sun comes up.
We are the something else,
Who were here,
To greet Christopher Columbus
We were born from
This earth,
Crawled out of the center,
Of our mother’s womb, we are important, we are strong.
We are something else,
We are Pueblo people, Plains people, Forest People, Desert
people, Nomadic people, Cliff dwellers, Ocean fishers, Lake and
river fishers, hunters, medicine collectors, horse riders, artists,
speakers, lawyers, doctors, teachers, we are human beings.
We are something else,
We are Native People,
Indigenous to this land.
We are a proud,
Something else."
"Distracted from COVID-19, Attention Shifts to MIA Maiden from Land O’Lakes Butter Box","America mourns for the Indian
figure who knelt like a supplicant before dairy,
fatly blessed our milks, our cheeses,

O our butter maiden

Dear New Blood,"You don’t need me, I know, here on
this podium with my poem. You
hunched in the back of the room,
tilted in your hard-earned reservation
lean. You ho-hum your gaze out the
window toward some other sky.  
Dear new blood, dear holy dear fully
mixed up mixed down mixed in and
out blood, go ahead and kick the shit,
kiss the shit from my ears. I swear I
swear I’ll listen. Stutter at stutter at me you
uptown weed you thorn you
petal, aim my old flowered face at the
sky.
I know you don’t need me, here on
this podium with my poem. You
pressed flat to the wall, shoulders
cocked, loaded for makwa, for old
growlers like me. You yawn your
glance out the window at the
tempting sky.
Wake me. Bang my dead drum drum,
clang clang my anvil my bell. Shout me
hush me your song, your shiny
impossible, your long, wounded song.
Tell me everything you know, you
don’t. Tell me, do you feel conquered
and occupied? Maybe I’ve forgotten.
Sing it plain, has America ever let you
be you in your own sky?
Sing deep Chaco, deep Minneapolis,
deep Standing Rock, deep Oakland
and LA. Sing deep Red Cliff, sing
Chicago, deep Acoma, deep Pine Ridge
and Tahlequah. Mourn. I think you,
too, were born with broken heart.
Rise. Smash your un-American throat
against the edge of the sky.
You don’t need me, I know. But don’t
go don’t look away. I need you."
A Picture,"I drew a picture long ago—
    A picture of a sullen sea; 
A picture that I value now
    Because it clears Life’s mystery. 
My sea was dark and full of gloom; 
   I painted rocks of sombre hue. 
My sky alone bespoke of light, 
    And that I painted palest blue.
But e’en across my sky of blue
    Stretched troubled clouds of sodden gray, 
Through which the sun shone weak and dim, 
    With only here and there a ray. 
Around my rocks the yellow foam 
   Seemed surging, moaning in despair
As if the waves, their fury spent, 
   Left naught but desolation there. 
Three crafts with fluttering sails I drew, 
    And one sailed near the rocks of gray, 
The other on its westward course, 
   Went speeding out of danger’s way.
The other still outdistanced them 
    Where sky and water seemed to met. 
I painted that with sails full set, 
    And then my picture was complete.
My life was like the sullen sea, 
   Misfortunes, woes, my rocks of gray, 
The crafts portrayed Life’s changing scenes, 
   The clouded sky Life’s troubled Day.
I longed to paint that picture o’er
   Without the rocks of sombre hue; 
Without the troubled clouds of gray,
  I’ll paint the sky of brightest blue.
My sea shall lay in calm repose, 
    No hint of surging, moaning sigh.
My crafts, unhindered by the rocks,
  Shall speed in joyous swiftness by.
But this shall be when brightest hours
  Of hope and cheer are given me.
I’ll paint this picture when Life’s sun 
   Shines clear upon Prosperity "
Polycystic Study of Intimacy,"But where do the breasts go first is my question.
I understand their fantasies of fleeing south. 
The winters are loud and long and white 
and by March, well. I wonder why I’m still 
in it too. Now the round pits thumb up 
beneath the skin, tender and hot to the touch, 
crushed by my new weight. This island I’ve 
had to make of myself brought a bevy, 
angered by easy pleasures: sugar, soy sauce, 
potatoes, ice cream. My love’s language 
is to make a meal, ask what I can take in, 
ask what maladies to avoid. As for my house:
touch is far and few between. Desire wanes 
between compresses of cloves cinnamon turmeric 
and honey.  But in the mornings, a gulf between us, 
my hands are kissed. The blinds drawn to keep
the sun from disturbing my sleep while we wait 
patiently for my body’s quiet prayer of thanks."
In the Evening,"The night air is filled
with the scent of apples,
and the moon is nearly full.
In the next room, Jim
is reading; a small cat sleeps
in the crook of his arm.
The night singers are loud,
proclaiming themselves
every evening until they run
out of nights and die in
the cold, or burrow down into
the mud to dream away the winter.
My office is awash in books
and photographs, and the sepia/pink
sunset stains all its light touches.
I’ve never been a good traveler,
but there are days, like this one,
when I’d pay anything to be in
another country, or standing on
the cold, grey moon, staring back
at the disaster we call our world.
We crave change, but
turn away from it.
We drown in contradictions.
Tonight, I’ll sleep
blanketed in moonlight.
In my dreams, I’ll have
nothing to say about anything
important. I’ll simply live my life,
and let the night singers live theirs,
until all of us are gone.
I won’t say a word, and let
silence speak in my stead."
The Word for Gossip,"Loosely translated in English
means “They say.” Tuscarora
and English do not run through
the cerebral cortex on the same
groove. They are like the Two
Row Wampum, a treaty pronouncing
relationships between our people
and the first white people arriving
on our shores. We made it after
those new people inexplicably
decided the sand and everything
following it was in fact theirs, decided
that because we were not Christians,
their god could not have meant it
for us. Then we said skoden, agreeing and
thinking they agreed, we must each travel side
by side like two canoes, neither crossing
in the other vessel’s movement forward.
Because they are different, the parts can not
be parsed in English. Eee-ogg, or Eee-awk
(depending on your family inflection)
is not neatly divided. Eee is not they,
ogg (or awk) is not say. And no, it’s not
Ewok, the animate Teddy Bears from Return
of the Jedi. And please don’t say “this is too
hard to remember.” If you can learn to say
Tatooine or Alderaan, or Obi-Wan Kenobi,
or god forbid, Jar Jar Binks, you can learn
to say Eee-awk (or Eee-ogg)
Tuscarora is a verb based language,
an action language, where English
loves its nouns more. In English
you want to know who is doing
scandalous things, the activity less
important, as long as it’s juicy.
In English, you want to say “I heard”
and not “They say,” and if you don’t
understand the importance of that
difference, it is good that we travel
our parallel paths, crossing only in
the wake we leave to dissipate behind us."
Becoming a Ghost,"Ask me about the time
my brother ran towards the sun
arms outstretched. His shadow chased him
from corner store to church
where he offered himself in pieces.
Ask me about the time
my brother disappeared. At 16,
tossed his heartstrings over telephone wire,
dangling for all the rez dogs to feed on.
Bit by bit. The world took chunks of
my brother’s flesh.
Ask me about the first time
we drowned in history. 8 years old
during communion we ate the body of Christ
with palms wide open, not expecting wine to be
poured into our mouths. The bitterness
buried itself in my tongue and my brother
never quite lost his thirst for blood or vanishing
for more days than a shadow could hold.
Ask me if I’ve ever had to use
bottle caps as breadcrumbs to help
my brother find his way back home.
He never could tell the taste between
a scar and its wounding, an angel or demon.
Ask me if I can still hear his
exhaled prayers: I am still waiting to be found.
To be found, tell me why there is nothing
more holy than becoming a ghost."
Pockets,"Let us, instead, consider the pockets 
Martin Rodriguez sewed onto the insides 
of his jacket and pants. 
                                      This was 5th grade.
This isn’t about the fact that he got caught 
jacking a bunch of shit from Market Spot. 
All of us wished we’d thought of it first. 
                                                                 We need 
to stay focused on those extra pockets. How 
big those caverns must have been—that fortune 
of whispered temptation. 
                                           Boy-genius, we said. 
Pockets for bags of apple-rings, beef jerky. A Pepsi 
2-liter. Crunch bars. Cans of Cactus Cooler, 
maybe. The lonely monster of desire bent us 
away from boyhood, made it something small 
that we wanted to toss rocks at. 
                                                    Rolls of Oreos 
in those pockets. Enough Doublemint gum 
to anchor friends on a green recess field. A few
sheets of temporary tattoos to offer in class 
while Mrs. Hawkins continued her lesson 
on the Gold Rush. 
                               I can see those pockets 
pomegranate when pulled apart: a bloom 
of endings across the Market Spot parking lot 
as he tried to run. Bomb Pop ice cream bars, 
or the cartoon kind with gumballs for eyes, 
oozing out. 
                   Look, I am talking about collapse. 
As always. The rest of the poem wants to go 
like this: I don’t know what happened 
to Martin Rodriguez. He never came back
to school. But the truth is he returned to class 
the next day. 
                     We stood in a circle, laughing 
about what he took until the day Manny 
got caught smoking weed. Then we talked 
about that until someone’s cousin got shot 
after school by the computer lab. We played 
Oregon Trail on Thursdays. None of us 
could ever cross the river. I kept dying 
of snake bite. 
                       We got older and painted walls 
for different crews. We became enemies, me 
and Martin, drawing exes over each other. We 
turned into no one, and then, 
                                                finally, we became 
fathers. I saw him, years later, with his son. 
We crossed each other on the street. Both of us 
nodded and kept on moving toward the sidewalk. 
So many years collapsing into each other, 
I thought. 
                  Someone has changed the sign 
in front of the store. But if I say Market Spot
today, the homie points to where we watched 
the cashier jump the counter and snatch Martin 
into the air, splicing it with sugar. The sharp kick 
of a boy’s legs. A body jolted into enough quiet 
that police were called. Officers with notepads, 
                the cashier waving flies away from his face."
To the Pine Tree,"Zhingwaak gaa-ozhibii’aan Bamewawagezhikaquay

Gaagige wezhaawashkozid. – Forever he is the green one."
There was earth inside them,"translated by Pierre Joris
There was earth inside them, and
they dug.
They dug and dug, thus did
their day go, their night. And they did not praise God,
who, so they heard, wanted all this,
who, so they heard, knew all this.
They dug and heard nothing more;
they didn’t grow wise, invented no song,
thought up no language for themselves.
They dug.
A stillness came, a storm too came,
all the seas came.
I dig, you dig, and the worm too digs,
and what sings over there says: they dig.
O one, o no one, o noone, o you:
Where did it lead, as it led nowhere?
O you dig and I dig, and I dig myself toward you,
and on our finger the ring awakens.
Es war Erde in ihnen
Es war Erde in ihnen, und
sie gruben.
Sie gruben und gruben, so ging
ihr Tag dahin, ihre Nacht. Und sie lobten nicht Gott,
der, so hörten sie, alles dies wollte,
der, so hörten sie, alles dies wußte.
Sie gruben und hörten nichts mehr;
sie wurden nicht weise, erfanden kein Lied,
erdachten sich keinerlei Sprache.
Sie gruben.
Es kam eine Stille, es kam auch ein Sturm,
es kamen die Meere alle.
Ich grabe, du gräbst, und es gräbt auch der Wurm,
und das Singende dort sagt: Sie graben.
O einer, o keiner, o niemand, o du:
Wohin gings, da’s nirgendhin ging?
O du gräbst und ich grab, und ich grab mich dir zu,
und am Finger erwacht uns der Ring."
Amphibious,"“These people, both men and women, seem amphibious, and to be able to live on water as well as on the land, so well do they swim and dive. Five pieces of iron were thrown into the sea to them for the pleasure of seeing them exercise themselves. One of them was skillful enough to get all five of them, and in so short a time, that one can regard it as marvelous.”
            —observations of indigenous Filipinos by the Dutch in 1600, from Sucesos de las Islas Filipinas, by Antonio de Morga
To be amphibious
is to breathe underwater          
gills and fins
illuminated in a flash of sun
to be sirenos1
es amar el mar
es tener cuerpos de agua2
desfrutar how the sea dances
along our spines
how it fills our hair
makes us weightless
We do not care if we are seen
taken as entertainment
desnudos
observados en un acto sagrado3

Our brown bodies split the water
no para conquista
kundi para sa unyon4
Our bangka5 are extensions
of our katawan ng tubig6.
Do you know which hands carved this wood?
Mula saang mga puno?7
Whose spirits guide us to the other side?

Hindi namin kailangan ng mga mapa8
Hindi namin kailangan ng mga kumpas                 
Feel the immense dagat move beneath us        
Can you feel it, through the thick hulls
of your conquering vessels?
We do not disrupt the harmony of things.
Can you plunge your hand into the sea
and bring up a fish?
Can you split one into two thousand pieces
so that every mouth is filled?   
Can you perform such the miracles
you describe in your holy book?

is to breathe underwater.
  1Both in Filipino and Spanish, this refers to mermen, but in Filipino folklore, while also including a version of a tantalizing creature (usually female) that leads fishermen to their deaths, sirenas/sirenos are are also engkantos or spirit-guardians of the sea. The colonial and indigenous influences in this mythology are both evident.
2“is to love the sea/is to have bodies of water”
3“naked/observed in a sacred act”
4These two lines show how Tagalog incorporated Spanish as one sees the shared words; it goes from Spanish, “not for conquest” to Tagalog “but for union”
5Bangka are Filipino outrigger boats with ancient origins that are carved from wood; it was believed that the spirit of the tree or an anito (guardian spirit) was imbued in the boat, especially through ritual consecration.
6“Bodies of water”
7“From which trees?”
8“We do not need maps / We do not need compasses”
9anito are ancestors, nature spirits, or deities in precolonial, indigenous Filipino systems, which were animistic. The word also can refer to statues and figures representing the spirits.
10“All living beings / protect us”
11“Each plankton, each tiny shrimp / each living thing”
12“To be in harmony with the sea”"
A Rogue Dream,"after Olivia Gatwood
I get ready for my first day as the new girl in high school
already knowing what not to wear. I dress perfectly
to stand out and disappear. I know how to put on
makeup, and I do it exactly right. My hair
looks awesome, of course! I step onto the bus,
pause by the driver, raise my arms like a superstar,
and meet the eyes of my adoring audience.
Three different beautiful girls punch
each other in the face to have me sit next to them.
I decline and the school’s most lovely, artsy boy
slides over to make room. He knows his feelings
and only goes too far
when he honestly misunderstands. He’s one of the safer ones.
I walk down the halls and no one makes fun of me.
I pass the section of lockers where her locker is, and
she is there, taking a book out of her backpack.
She’ll go running this weekend, as usual, and won’t
be followed. The man who won’t be following
her has already followed half a dozen women
to rape and kill and leave in the woods. But she won’t be
followed. She’ll survive her fate this time, and come back
to school on Monday, avoid the mean girls in the bathroom.
She’ll pick on the new girl, call her a virgin of all things.
She’ll limp her way through math, cheat a bit in science,
do pretty good in history and English. She’ll graduate,
and go to the state school on a track scholarship. She’ll
have two girls and keep them safe. She’ll almost forget
about this other ending: her in the woods near her house,
staring at the ground beneath her, wondering why."
"1918, Iva Describes Her Deathbed","No, it wasn’t like that—you didn’t see
He was lying quietly, mouth shut, one hand on his chest,
The other frozen mid-stir
We were be side one another
When they found us
                          Be side, what a wonderful word
Be side is the scent I carry
Be side the first man I touched
And his touching me.
Be side him when I woke.
Fully awake,
                          I hear something,

A kitten crying because she is lost
Because she is forsaken
Because she is left alive.

Remember our fishing hole at Byng?
A cold underground stream feeds it,
Gorgeous switch canes at the blue water’s edge 
Make sturdy Cherokee baskets
Remember?

Together we’ll catch a mess of perch,
Cut the canes and load the wagon
We’ll have the folks over for supper
Just a half day’s wagon ride away,
Not far.

So Many Constellations,"translated by Pierre Joris
So many constellations, dis-
played to us. I was,
when I looked at you—when?—
outside with
the other worlds.
O, these paths, galactic,
O this hour that billowed
the nights over to us into
the burden of our names. It is,
I know, not true,
that we lived, a mere
breath blindly moved between
there and not-there and sometimes,
comet-like an eye whizzed
toward extinguished matter, in the canyons,
there where it burned out, stood
tit-gorgeous time, along
which grew up and down
& away what
is or was or will be—,
I know,
I know and you know, we knew,
we didn’t know, for we
were there and not there,
and sometimes, when
only Nothingness stood between us, we
found truly together.
  Soviel Gestirne
Soviel Gestirne, die
man uns hinhält. Ich war,
als ich dich ansah – wann? –,
draußen bei
den andern Welten.
O diese Wege, galaktisch,
o diese Stunde, die uns
die Nächte herüberwog in
die Last unsrer Namen. Es ist,
ich weiß es, nicht wahr,
daß wir lebten, es ging
blind nur ein Atem zwischen
Dort und Nicht-da und Zuweilen,
kometenhaft schwirrte ein Aug
auf Erloschenes zu, in den Schluchten,
da, wo’s verglühte, stand
zitzenprächtig die Zeit,
an der schon empor- und hinab-
und hinwegwuchs, was
ist oder war oder sein wird –,
ich weiß,
ich weiß und du weißt, wir wußten,
wir wußten nicht, wir
waren ja da und nicht dort,
und zuweilen, wenn
nur das Nichts zwischen uns stand, fanden
wir ganz zueinander."
Your Having Crossed,"translated by Pierre Joris
Your
having crossed over tonight.
With words I brought you back, here you are,
all is true and a waiting
for the true.
The bean climbs in front
of our window: think
of who grows up near us and
watches it.
God, we read it, is
a part and a second one, scattered:
in the death
of all the mowed ones
he grows toward himself.
That’s where
our gaze leads us,
with this
half
we stay in touch.
  Dein Hinübersein
Dein
Hinübersein heute Nacht.
Mit Worten holt ich dich wieder, da bist du,
alles ist wahr und ein Warten
auf Wahres.
Es klettert die Bohne vor
unserm Fenster: denk
wer neben uns aufwächst und
ihr zusieht.
Gott, das lasen wir, ist
ein Teil und ein zweiter, zerstreuter:
im Tod
all der Gemähten
wächst er sich zu.
Dorthin
führt uns der Blick,
mit dieser
Hälfte
haben wir Umgang."
Everything is Different,"translated by Pierre Joris
Everything is different from what you think, from what I think,
the flag still flutters,
the little secrets are still secret,
they still throw shadows, on this
you live, I live, we live.
The silver coin on your tongue melts,
it tastes of tomorrow, of forever, a road
to Russia rises into your heart,
the Karelian birch
has
waited,
the name Osip comes toward you, you tell him
what he already knows, he takes it, he takes it off you with hands,
you detach his arms from their shoulder, the right, the left,
you fasten yours in their stead, with hands, with fingers, with lines,
—what tore off, grows back together again—
you have them now, so take them now, you have them both,
the name, the name, the hand, the hand,
there, take them as your pledge,
he takes that too, and you have
again what’s yours, what was his,
windmills
push air into your lungs, you row
through the canals, lagoons, and grachten,
in wordlight,
no Why at the stern, no Where-to at the bow, a ram’s horn lifts you
—Tekiah!—
like a trumpet blast above nights into day, the augurs
maul each other, man
has his peace, god
has his, love
returns to the beds, the hair
of the women grows back,
the inturned bud
on their breasts
rises to day again, toward life-,
toward heart-lines it wakens
in your hand, that rose along the loinpath,—
what is it called, you country
behind the mountain, behind the year?
I know what it’s called.
Like the Winter’s Tale, it is called,
it is called like the Summer’s Tale,
your mother’s Three-Year-Land, that’s what it was,
what it is,
it wanders everywhere, like language,
throw it away, throw it away,
then you’ll have it again, like
that pebble from
the Moravian swale
your thought carried to Prague,
to the grave, all the graves, into life,
it’s long
gone, like the letters, like all
the lanterns, you must
search for it again, there it is,
it’s small, it lies there,
[um die Ecke, da liegt er]
near Normandy-Niemen—in Bohemia,
there, there, there,
behind the house, in front of the house,
white it is, white, it says:
Today—counts.
White it is, white, a water-
surge rushes through it, a heartsurge,
a river,
you know its name, the banks
hang heavy with day, like the name,
you scan it, with your hand:
Alba.
Es ist alles anders
Es ist alles anders, als du es dir denkst, als ich es mir denke,
die Fahne weht noch,
die kleinen Geheimnisse sind noch bei sich,
sie werfen noch Schatten, davon
lebst du, leb ich, leben wir.
Die Silbermünze auf deiner Zunge schmilzt,
sie schmeckt nach Morgen, nach Immer, ein Weg
nach Rußland steigt dir ins Herz,
die karelische Birke
hat
gewartet,
der Name Ossip kommt auf dich zu, du erzählst ihm,
was er schon weiß, er nimmt es, er nimmt es dir ab, mit Händen,
du löst ihm den Arm von der Schulter, den rechten, den linken,
du heftest die deinen an ihre Stelle, mit Händen, mit Fingern, mit Linien,
—was abriß, wächst wieder zusammen—
da hast du sie, da nimm sie dir, da hast du alle beide,
den Namen, den Namen, die Hand, die Hand,
da nimm sie dir zum Unterpfand,
er nimmt auch das, und du hast
wieder, was dein ist, was sein war,
Windmühlen
stoßen dir Luft in die Lunge, du ruderst
durch die Kanäle, Lagunen und Grachten,
bei Wortschein,
am Heck kein Warum, am Bug kein Wohin, ein Widderhorn hebt dich
—Tekiah!—
wie ein Posaunenschall über die Nächte hinweg in den Tag, die Auguren
zerfleischen einander, der Mensch
hat seinen Frieden, der Gott
hat den seinen, die Liebe
kehrt in die Betten zurück, das Haar
der Frauen wächst wieder,
die nach innen gestülpte
Knospe an ihrer Brust
tritt wieder zutag, lebens-,
herzlinienhin erwacht sie
dir in der Hand, die den Lendenweg hochklomm,—
wie heißt es, dein Land
hinterm Berg, hinterm Jahr?
Ich weiß, wie es heißt.
Wie das Wintermärchen, so heißt es,
es heißt wie das Sommermärchen,
das Dreijahreland deiner Mutter, das war es,
das ists,
es wandert überallhin, wie die Sprache,
wirf sie weg, wirf sie weg,
dann hast du sie wieder, wie ihn,
den Kieselstein aus
der Mährischen Senke,
den dein Gedanke nach Prag trug,
aufs Grab, auf die Gräber, ins Leben,
längst
ist er fort, wie die Briefe, wie alle
Laternen, wieder
mußt du ihn suchen, da ist er,
klein ist er, weiß,
um die Ecke, da liegt er,
bei Normandie-Njemen—in Böhmen,
da, da, da,
hinterm Haus, vor dem Haus,
weiß ist er, weiß, er sagt:
Heute—es gilt.
Weiß ist er, weiß, ein Wasser-
strahl findet hindurch, ein Herzstrahl,
ein Fluß,
du kennst seinen Namen, die Ufer
hängen voll Tag, wie der Name,
du tastest ihn ab, mit der Hand:
Alba."
The Seven Prisms of My Blood,"after Yvan Goll
In the absent oils of your eyes two brown ores
resting leisurely on the view of your children.

You uncoil casually. My hand slipping
to the west and what was felled fills me

until I fall forward injuring your already dead arm.
I am so sorry. Our wills in a twist. Electric.

Some pulse between the gurney and the distant coffin.
My camera shutter clicking wildly around my neck.

Back home tus rab hlau searches for your hands.
The soil to harden. Rapture on the way. Onions

sprouting passionately as neglected gardens do.
The seven prisms of my blood bursting through my ears.

Your living children still living. Your garden goddess
drying the last goods in her shrine. With spring-like

precision the sun weeps until I boil. My head cracked
in four places. The ribbed earth catching fatal drops

of your blood or mine. You beseech me but in my time
I’ve slept away the sun. The underside of distance.

But I behold you now in this cool church and for a ransom.
I photograph you again and again. Your form crystalizing.

Your parted mouth a new annex to the ancestral house.
Your bones at the table. O how fair the jaundiced skies.

You get up to close that clear brittle door."
On the Hills of Dawn,"Behold, the morning-glory’s sky-blue cup
Is mine wherewith to drink the nectar up
That morning spills of silver dew,
And song upon the winds that woo
And sigh their vows
Among the boughs!
Behold, I’m rich in diamonds rare,
And pearls, and breathe a golden air;
My room is filled with shattered beams
Of light; my life is one of dreams,
In my hut on
The hills of dawn."
Self-Portrait as the Changeling,"after René Auberjonois
Wet, where all I had longed for             
was the determined touch of softness. Wet, 
             I watched the solids come and go. 
             I counted feet, that ache
and echo of planets, became 
the prosecutor and defense 
             of my own heart, that red-tailed escape 
             from the struggle to represent 
the shapes required of love. 
A rose bud, briefcase 
             or snarling mutt, pea soup, 
             blood blister—I knew hate most
not as these but in my 
formlessness, poured into a coffee cup
            my keeper mimicked to sip. 
             I could not honey my clay. 
The shape of our star days, 
a hum in the rookery of birds 
             I’d know, and never be.
             And when I found my people—
when my people meddled 
with me—they opened a hole 
             to home in the punch-clock 
             of deep space I was destined 
to fall through."
Marshlands,"A thin wet sky, that yellows at the rim,
And meets with sun-lost lip the marsh’s brim.
The pools low lying, dank with moss and mould,
Glint through their mildews like large cups of gold
Among the wild rice in the still lagoon,
In monotone the lizard shrills his tune.
The wild goose, homing, seeks a sheltering,
Where rushes grow, and oozing lichens cling.
Late cranes with heavy wing, and lazy flight,
Sail up the silence with the nearing night.
And like a spirit, swathed in some soft veil,
Steals twilight and its shadows o’er the swale.
Hushed lie the sedges, and the vapours creep,
Thick, grey and humid, while the marshes sleep."
From “The Age of Aquarius”,"Let the sunshine, let the sunshine in. I have learned to repeat these words to myself whenever I feel stuck.
Fear rustles mantras out of my body. I have risked a motherland. Why not also seduce the foreigner who implores nativity if loneliness can be broken and shared?
                                                          When Hair: The American Tribal Love-Rock Musical debuts on Broadway in April of 1968, it becomes the first production to include a nude scene with its entire cast.
Around the same time, Star Trek has popularized the phrase, Where no man has gone before.
Our bodies contain elements of outer space. So that when we’re naked we are gazing at the universe.
                                                          The night of my second panic attack, after getting released from the hospital and determined to change my mental health’s course, I dream of a nebula in the shape of an octopus, holding an astronaut in each tentacle. From my perspective, the cosmonauts feed on all my arms.
                                                          No more falsehoods or derisions. Golden living dreams of visions. Mystic crystal revelation and the mind's true liberation.
                                                          In the Age of Aquarius, give or take, plurality overtakes singularity. History becomes bored by its self-referentialism. Triangles burrow into single lines. Equal signs collapse on the spikes of other equal signs.
In the Age of Aquarius, give or take, we give birth to information and information delivers us. I make a fist and my fist speaks in four languages. Letters enter me and suddenly I experience flavors few before me have.
In the Age of Aquarius, give or take, gender is a tree is a building is a cloud. It is anything that hasn’t been said. The truest instinct one listens to more and more."
America is Loving Me to Death,"acrostic golden shovel
America is loving me to death, loving me to death slowly, and I
Mainly try not to be disappeared here, knowing she won’t pledge
Even tolerance in return. Dear God, I can’t offer allegiance.
Right now, 400 years ago, far into the future―it’s difficult to
Ignore or forgive how despised I am and have been in the
Centuries I’ve been here—despised in the design of the flag
And in the fealty it demands (lest I be made an example of).
In America there’s one winning story—no adaptations. The
Story imagines a noble, grand progress where we’re all united.
Like truths are as self-evident as the Declaration states.
Or like they would be if not for detractors like me, the ranks of
Vagabonds existing to point out what’s rotten in America,
Insisting her gains come at a cost, reminding her who pays, and
Negating wild notions of exceptionalism—adding ugly facts to
God’s-favorite-nation mythology. Look, victors get spoils; I know the
Memories of the vanquished fade away. I hear the enduring republic,
Erect and proud, asking through ravenous teeth Who do you riot for?
Tamir? Sandra? Medgar? George? Breonna? Elijah? Philando? Eric? Which
One? Like it can’t be all of them. Like it can’t be the entirety of it:
Destroyed brown bodies, dismantled homes, so demolition stands
Even as my fidelity falls, as it must. She erases my reason too, allows one
Answer to her only loyalty test: yes or no, Michael, do you love this nation?
Then hates me for saying I can’t, for not burying myself under
Her fables where we’re one, indivisible, free, just, under God, her God.

 "
The Way Words Echo in Our Heads,"I wish we could hear them just once,
instead of over and over.
One day, tired, I sat down on the couch
just to listen to the ringing in my ears.
My eyes are so deep-set in my head
it makes it hard to see
past the memory of lost glamour,
being born too late, living in the shadow
of a beautiful downtown turned into
a ghost town, a hollowed hulk,
and how that itself now turns into
a memory of treasures,
how when something taken for granted
is suddenly over, the pause when you take stock
and realize you’ll never have as much,
that change is always a lessening,
the wall effect, you can’t see what’s next
even though it’s supposedly obvious.
I don’t know what to say about that,
I mean, I’m just barely here."

The Vampire,"translated by Alejandro Cáceres Joseph
In the bosom of the sad evening
I called upon your sorrow… Feeling it was
Feeling your heart as well. You were pale
Even your voice, your waxen eyelids,
Lowered… and remained silent… You seemed
To hear death passing by… I who had opened
Your wound bit on it—did you feel me?—
As into the gold of a honeycomb I bit!
I squeezed even more treacherously, sweetly
Your heart mortally wounded,
By the cruel dagger, rare and exquisite,
Of a nameless illness, until making it bleed in sobs!
And the thousand mouths of my damned thirst
I offered to that open fountain in your suffering.

Why was I your vampire of bitterness?
Am I a flower or a breed of an obscure species
That devours sores and gulps tears?
  El vampiro
En el regazo de la tarde triste
Yo invoqué tu dolor… Sentirlo era
Sentirte el corazón! Palideciste
Hasta la voz, tus párpados de cera,
Bajaron… y callaste… y pareciste
Oír pasar la Muerte… Yo que abriera
Tu herida mordí en ella —¿me sentiste? —
Como en el oro de un panal mordiera!
Y exprimí más, traidora, dulcemente
Tu corazón herido mortalmente,
Por la cruel daga rara y exquisita
De un mal sin nombre, hasta sangrarlo en llanto!
Y las mil bocas de mi sed maldita
Tendí á esa fuente abierta en tu quebranto.
.  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  
¿Por qué fui tu vampiro de amargura?…
¿Soy flor ó estirpe de una especie obscura
Que come llagas y que bebe el llanto?"
Revolutionary Letter #1,"I have just realized that the stakes are myself
I have no other
ransom money, nothing to break or barter but my life
my spirit measured out, in bits, spread over
the roulette table, I recoup what I can
nothing else to shove under the nose of the maitre de jeu
nothing to thrust out the window, no white flag
this flesh all I have to offer, to make the play with
this immediate head, what it comes up with, my move
as we slither over this go board, stepping always
(we hope) between the lines"
Stretto,"translated by Pierre Joris

Displaced into
the terrain
with the unmistakable track:
Grass, written asunder. The stones, white,
with the stalks’ shadows:
Stop reading—look!
Stop looking—go!
Go, your hour
has no sisters, you are—
are at home. A wheel, slowly,
rolls out of itself, the spokes
climb,
climb on a blackish field, night
needs no stars, nowhere
are you asked after.

   *
                                                   Nowhere
                                                                are you asked after—
The place where they lay, it has
a name—it has
none. They didn’t lie there. Something
lay between them. They
didn’t see through it.
Didn’t see, no,
talked of
words. None
woke up,
sleep
came over them.

   *
                                               Came, came. Nowhere
                                                                                   asked after—
It’s me, me,
I lay between you, I was
open, was
audible, I ticked toward you, your breath
obeyed, I
am still the one, as
you’re asleep.

   *
                                                                          Am still the one—
Years.
Years, years, a finger
feels down and up, feels
around:
seams, palpable, here
they gape wide open, here
it grew together again—who
covered it up?

   *
                                                             Covered it
                                                                            up—who?
Came, came.
Came a word, came,
came through the night,
wanted to shine, wanted to shine.
Ashes.
Ashes, ashes.
Night.
Night-and-night.—To
the eye, go, to the moist.

Hurricanes.
Hurricanes, from whenever,
particle flurries, the other,
you
know this, we
read it in the book, it was
opinion.
Was, was
opinion. How
did we grasp
each other—with
these
hands?
And it stood written that.
Where? We
put a silence over it,
poison-stilled, huge,
a
green
silence, a sepal, a
thought of plant life hung from it—
green, yes
hung, yes,
under spiteful
skies.
Of, yes,
plant life.
Yes.
Hurricanes, par-
ticle flurries, there remained
time, remained,
to try it with the stone—it
was hospitable, it
didn’t interrupt. How
good we had it:
gritty,
gritty and stringy. Stalky,
dense;
clustery and raying; knobbly,
level and
clumpy; loose, bran-
ching—: he, it
did not interrupt, it
spoke,
liked speaking to dry eyes, before it closed them.
Spoke, spoke.
Was, was.
We
did not let go, held tight
in the midst, a
pore-structure, and
it came.
Came up to us, came
right through, sewed
invisibly, sewed
at the last membrane,
and
the world, a thousandcrystal,
formed, formed.

Nights, separated out. Circles,
green or blue, red
squares: the
world puts its innermost
into play with the new
hours.—Circles
red or black, bright
squares, no
flight shadows,
no
plane table, no
smokesoul rises and plays along.

In owlflight, near
petrified leprosy,
near
our fled hands, in
the latest fault lines,
above the
bullet trap on
the ruined wall:
visible, a-

furrows, the
choirs, back then, the
psalms. Ho, ho-

The
temples still stand. A
star
still has its light.
Nothing,
nothing is lost.
Ho-

from “The Voice of Sheila Chandra”,"Carried cacophony world wheel
Into the human one small voice
Box pool swum midnight we went
Into the sea expecting our prayers
Might carry themselves across
The silver-slammed surface would
Be answered or do they answer
Pale cut of prayers do not answer

Are those stripes of light across

Reparation,"40 acres & a jewel-encrusted orchid crown
for each & every living baby girl
growing up the way

we do. Unbridled. Unburied

by the U.S. school-to-prison
state’s laser-like vision.
Bi-weekly standing ovations.
Bras-Coupé resuscitated
with a sledgehammer slung over
his left shoulder, eyes ablaze
& dead set on the private
sector, the price
of four-year tuition, four-year
fascist presidents, any & all forms
of predatory opulence. Scholarships.
Scholars that love us
enough to break this language
lengthwise, filled as it is
with the bones of our fallen. Monuments
to the fallen. A grave site
for the illustrious Negro dead,
like Zora Neale Hurston said,
illustrious meaning you were black
& full of adoration, or vexed,
which is just another way
of saying you wanted to survive
the world said die
& you refused its refusal.
Another approach to the general
sentiment that Blackness
is beautiful, with no referent
to their everyday negation
of our essential, human splendor.
An apology on the Senate
floor. For the trade, the plunder
of our names, unremarked
graves, a hand in the hair,
a boot to the throat, guns
in the schools & the guns
are the books, the stares
of the second grade teacher
calling your son a distraction,
your daughter’s braids illegal,
your building a blight
on the neighborhood,
the good you do & dream
of never quite good
enough to merit
the bull’s eye’s removal.
A ship to wherever
we point on a map

Still Life with Toy Gun,"for Tamir Rice and John Crawford III
after the after-party empties both of its fists
the seven of us gather like a murder
of crows to loose bread around the last
table the dining hall has left. It’s late,
and vegetarian pizza is the best thing
the joint has going but we stay, mostly
to partake in what we would never call
gossip in front of our uncles but most
certainly is: who left with how many
numbers, top ten worst life choices
made that weekend, how Lauryn’s cobalt
dress lassoed every human breath in the room.
Night unspools. Our attention plants
its feet in late Clinton-era Everywhere
& we sing of what we yearned for back then,
back home, what mocked our small,
stupefied hands like a white stove
or the promise of beauty.
Consensus lands on Super Soakers.
B.B. guns. All manner of false weaponry
we were barred from as boys
because of a mother’s fear, her suspicion
that the rules of a given game might shift
& gunfire would be our only warning,
the policeman’s voice an aftershock, his first mouth
having already made its claim. Even now, no one
among us calls this a kind of theft, which is to say,
the term never launches like a hex from our tongues,
but even if it did, somehow, rise & alight the air, if everything
we missed during the years we grew tired trying not to die
found its own body right then, right there in the center
of campus, what difference could it make now
that we have already mastered the rule book, the protocol
we learned before we learned to slow
dance, or smooth talk, or scream
the lyrics of a favorite song in a group
of two or more & not feel ashamed
of all the noise a black body can make
while it is still living"
Summer Job,"For all we knew, there was no such thing as wealth
management internships sponsored by a father’s
Harvard roommate, or else some Fifth Avenue gig
running iced coffee for fashionistas an hour’s ride away
from where we stood, the darkest thing for miles,
trash collection claws extending from our sleeves
like some late 80’s cyborg fantasy. We were bored
out of our brains, unlettered, sharp enough still
to know our place in the grander proletarian scheme:
a pair of scholarship kids paid to maintain campus
while our peers tried their hands at college physics,
American industry, psychedelics and road trips
to the mid-west with friends, all while Devin and I
stood in our standard-issue jumpsuits, adding another
coat of white paint to the cafeteria walls without irony.
There were no small iron gods in our pockets then;
no machines to thread us into the invisible world, and so
we passed entire mornings listening to the ceremonies
of birds we couldn’t name as we traversed the sides
of the high-way, each step perfecting our soon-to-be
flawless technique, dodging carrion, dividing paper waste
from condoms and bottles of Coors, just the way Jay taught
us our first day on-call. I spent most breaks in the rift
between observation and dreams, pulling music from the filthy
tales each older man on the maintenance crew cast like a cure
into the mind of the other. Folklore filling the desolate
lecture halls where we took lunch, laughing as we traded
one tradition for another. No future worth claiming apart
from that broken boiler in the next building, blackbirds
trapped in the gutter-way, getting pipes fixed before fall."
Owed to Ankle Weights,"Far as we could tell, Mark dreamt
of weightlessness & little else,
an entire career built upon
leapfrogging elephants
& lesser men. Though he
never deployed this exact
imagery in a public speech
or more casual tête-à-tête
over hot fries & Powerade,
the dream was well- known
throughout the jailhouse
beige middle school hallways
we bolted through.
Mark wears ankle weights
every day because that
is what ballers do
when they are serious,
& Mark is very serious
when it comes to
the business of giving
out buckets as a kind
of spiritual practice, ascension
under control, an outlet
pass flying language-like
across the length
of the court, Mark
catching the so-worn
-it’s-almost-gold
sphere in his dominant
palm, switching
to the left without what most
would call thought, soaring
like an invocation
to the cylinder & the crowd
leaps right along with him.
Hands aloft in awe
of the boy who must have
some falcon in his blood
-line somewhere, the sheer
eloquence of his movement
enough to make them forget
whatever heaviness like a second
skeleton held them flush to the ground
that day, whatever slight or malice
born in silence by necessity
simply melts, falls like a man
made of flowers to the floor.
When we closed our eyes
that year we all saw the same
fecund emptiness staring
back, imagined all we could
hammer our bodies into by way
of pure repetition: sprinting
to the bodega for Peanut Chews
before the cheese bus could leave
us behind, toting little
brothers all the way up
past the third flight
with no break for breath,
jumping rope with the girls by
the hydrant by the hardware
store at least once a week,
two-pound silver bricks
strapped to each leg,
tucked as if contraband
or some secret knowledge
into the lips of our lucky
socks, all that kept us
from drowning."

The bright

up

dog roses, that’s how they open,
they float
toward you, my quiet one,

I see you, you gather them with my

into the Bright-Again no one
has to weep for or name.

I Have Cut Bamboo,"translated by Pierre Joris
I have cut bamboo:
for you, my son.
I have lived.
This hut, to be carried-
away tomorrow, it
stands.
I did not help build it: you
don’t know into what kind of
vessels I put the sand around me, years ago, on
behest and command. Yours
comes from the open—it remains
free.
The culm taking root here, will still
stand, tomorrow, wherever your
soul may cast you in the bound-
less.
Ich habe Bambus geschnitten
Ich habe Bambus geschnitten:
für dich, mein Sohn.
Ich habe gelebt.
Diese morgen fort-
getragene Hütte, sie
steht.
Ich habe nicht mitgebaut: du
weißt nicht, in was für
Gefäße ich den
Sand um mich her tat, vor Jahren, auf
Geheiß und Gebot. Der deine
kommt aus dem Freien—er bleibt
frei.
Das Rohr, das hier Fuß faßt, morgen
steht es noch immer, wohin dich
die Seele auch hinspielt im Un-
gebundnen."
poetry is a temporal art,"“to touch and at once be touched”
            —Joshua Beckman
to touch and at once be touched
that’s what the poem does
reaches out w/ its long spindly arms its grandmother arms to hold you    but you are the arms also in the act of reaching, enfolding in yourself all the primness and solidarity and creakiness of the grandparent as it holds you thru the reaches of time  and you are time itself  grandfather time grandparent time  the grandiosity of time ticking away in its grandparent clock, the clock that haunted the halls of your grandparents and the further forebears that measure things not by clocks, but by the sun.  as the dawn rang out, everything was ok, we—our forebears—noted where the light of the sun first fell on the earth at dawn, bitole the sun’s rays, these were holy holy and where they fell is where we placed our firepit, and around that pit laid four stones, and those stones were the four directions, and from them measured out four tipi poles at equal distance, and between these eight more fanning out, and atop it erected a tipi the home of the holy person, and atop the tipi a crown of evergreens and other plants, yaa da’a’ah, the tops of the poles unshorn of their leaves, blessings were conferred, songs happened in time, to the beat of the deerhoof rattle, not to a beat itself  since a rattle’s noise is disparate, spread out, but to the idea or the sense of a beat nestled at the center of the shaking of the rattle and its small collection of sounds, thrill of the pulsatile universe unfolding across time, ‘across’ as if time were a length of thread, or a thing traversed in space    songs, poetry happened across the pulse of time, they were not like a painting making its ‘same damn face whether the Louvre was open or closed,’ but like music    happening in time, so that you couldn’t look at the whole thing all at once, you couldn’t look at its face headon    you had to perceive it apace, at a pace     it didn’t matter whether time was a thing you believed in or not, whether time was a thing that was real or not, whether it coalesced with space, the space you moved through with your foot on the real earth.        you spoke to your lover on a thing called ‘facetime’ because you were far apart in space, hours apart in time, you could not hold each other but you could see each other’s face, you could see the face but not touch it, it was a face as represented by a screen, your faces appeared to each other on this screen  and your voices too could be beheld, perceived, in and across time, and across space  they could be beheld but not touched, face-to-face you could be, of a kind, but your cheeks could not touch like in the song where the lovers danced cheek-to-cheek, and your lover said they didn’t want to have a relationship through this thing through this ‘face’ and this ‘time’ and you agreed.    a thing that everafter sterilized your concern into a thing seen but untouchable, like the painting in the museum, which could be looked and looked at only. ‘touch me only with thine eyes’ some prim poet probably once said.  ‘look but don’t touch’ one of my parents said to the other, speaking of attractive people.  that the gaze is said to touch, it is said to do violence.  take that sunmote out of your eye when you look at me.  take that beam out of your eye.  i am a crap.  i am a happenstance.  i am holy holy.  christ’s eyebeams pierced thomas too you know.    a woman wore the feather of a flicker on the top of the red blanket she wore around her shoulders in the peyote meetings of the lipan, who kept the beat first by a bow they hit with a stick, a stick not an arrow and then by various drums of water.  who tie up a drum in the flick of an eye.    a flicker is so called because the undersides of its wings are yellow, you see them in a golden flash flashing across the forest.  by you i mean me.  my lover once held me creakily in grandparent arms before it became an insect  and one calling all of the old ones of the desert to us, even embarrassed about the beat that it made because it was not native, it being the lover, still it was a holy thing, holy holy, díyín, díyínde, a holy person, singing a double beat, first to the earth and then to me, i am erthes i said, erthes, as two syllables, i felt the pricks the holy pricks of the lauered on the crown of my head and i felt them seeding, i felt them being seeded there, holy holy, there is no god there is only dííyi robert said, but what accounts for that thing we saw in the desert.    i seed and then i saw it, i seed and saw it,  a seesaw is a thing that you see and then you saw, it measures vision across time as the bodily movement of two children going up and going down, sawed in half the measure of my eye, the top of my head took clean off.  looking is not the same as touching.  there is a frog that looks with bifocular vision, the top half of its eye evolved a skill for looking above water, and the bottom half of its eye for looking below water.  when isánáklesh came out of the water she danced on the shore but for a long time she stayed in the water with her face half-submerged.  they didn’t know if it was a man or a woman.  when she came out of the water the bottom half of her face was stained with the minerals of the primordial pond.  the bottom half of her face looked white.  now they paint the girl that way with klesh  the white clay  the earth  on the bottom half of her face.  but she is isánáklesh now she is not the girl anymore.    poetry occurs in time, syllable by syllable.  a trance-state occurs peripherally, serially, over and over and in that state you ‘passed’ time but you didn’t notice the passing of time.  you were as it were beyond time,  though occurring in time and primarily to the beat of the rattle and the rhythm of the singing.    you can touch and be touched in a poem, though it come thru the ear, tho it come through the eye, it touches in the way a person is said to be touched, i’m touched you say when a thing touches you emotionally, and you touch your heart to indicate the heart, to say that that is where you are touched.  the heart is understood to be the seat of love.  a pulse is measured there, a cardiac pulse whose stoppage or whose arrest is death, the stopping or the stoppage of cardiac time.    we saw a snake upon the trail, a smooth green snake undulated into curves, elegant s-like curves upon the moss, hello i said, can i touch you i said, and taking its calm aspect for an acquiescence gently stroked the back of its back   and the snake  straightened out, and faced its face toward me, i do not know what this means in snake language.  perhaps i was touched to touch a snake, touched as in mad, mad as in crazy, feet not on the earth, not on the erthes as the creature itself was, and not its avatar, its whole body upon the earth.    time can have a wrinkle in it,   and wrinkles  can be ironed out."
Les Globes,"translated by Pierre Joris
In the muddled eyes—read there:
the sun’s, the heart’s ecliptics, the
gorgeously whizzing Fornothing.
The deaths and everything
they gave birth to. The
generation-chain,
that lies buried here and
that still hangs here, in the ether,
edging the abysses. All
the faces’ writing, into which
whirring wordsand drilled—Mini-eternal,
syllables.
Everything,
even the heaviest, was
fledged, nothing
held back.
In den verfahrenen Augen – lies da:
die Sonnen-, die Herzbahnen, das
sausend-schöne Umsonst.
Die Tode und alles
aus ihnen Geborene. Die
Geschlechterkette,
die hier bestattet liegt und
die hier noch hängt, im Äther,
Abgründe säumend. Aller
Gesichter Schrift, in die sich
schwirrender Wortsand gebohrt—Kleinewiges,
Silben.
Alles,
das Schwerste noch, war
flügge, nichts
hielt zurück."
Aspen Tree,"translated from the German by Pierre Joris
Aspen tree, your leaves gaze white into the dark.
My mother’s hair ne’er turned white.
Dandelion, so green is the Ukraine.
My fair-haired mother did not come home.
Rain cloud, do you dally by the well?
My quiet mother weeps for all.
Round star, you coil the golden loop.
My mother’s heart was seared by lead.
Oaken door, who ripped you off your hinges?
My gentle mother cannot return.
  Espenbaum
Espenbaum, dein Laub blickt weiß ins Dunkel.
Meiner Mutter Haar ward nimmer weiß.
Löwenzahn, so grün ist die Ukraine.
Meine blonde Mutter kam nicht heim.
Regenwolke, säumst du an den Brunnen?
Meine leise Mutter weint für alle.
Runder Stern, du schlingst die goldne Schleife.
Meiner Mutter Herz ward wund von Blei.
Eichne Tür, wer hob dich aus den Angeln?
Meine sanfte Mutter kann nicht kommen."
zero in on,"I turn on a light in a room I pace away from
take comfort behind neon signs    nested in wires
an errant mirror propped against a commercial strip
or cradled awkwardly in the elbows of a passerby
my legs become their legs
mushrooms came before us needing no light
now they clean up oil spills    rebuild biomes
ripped green awnings of my youth have become
sleek noun and noun stores like Gold and Rust where 
you can buy boutique sticks    stones    dead flowers
I’m more turned on by the defunct Mustang
its turquoise alive in the rain    nostalgia is dangerous 
turquoise that took millions of years to form   mined up
when there was one woman per one thousand men
Jin Ho threw herself into the bay when she learned
she would be sold into prostitution
threw herself not jumped so even in history she is 
an object possessing herself in an act of dispossession 
you make everything about yourself    
as if there’s another realm where I am real
if only    there was something essential    
an oil I could purchase that would reflect only you 
in my floral wrists shielding my eyes
here    take everything    my social security number
my hope that the rush of a population will crash"
Trance Essay for Remembering Images,"At first, I spoke to my neighbor daily, in part because of the weather
(he could still sit out on bench)
in part because of vice
(I was chain-smoking and he’d shout for one when I passed)
but this stopped, in part because of trust
(he did not believe I was smoking less and resented the imagined lie)
in part because of routes
(at first I added 15 minutes to my commute to walk north, past his apartment, towards 6th avenue, and up through the park, as this removes 25-50% of my anxiety, but now that I have lived here half a year, I find myself incapable of waking up early enough to permit this easy remedy, so I walk the other, faster direction)
and in part because of novelty
(having covered introductions, we now tend to say only “hello” when I do pass).
I have a sense of what he looks like, due to this regularity,
but I could not describe his building.
Someone I was hoping to kiss informed me
that it’s easy to remember
images (all you have to do, they said, is take
a lesson from a children’s book, one in which a girl could
remember anything she wanted by saying “click,”
and imagining she held a camera). Later, distracted
on my walk home by the kiss’s memory, which came
easily because my eyes had been closed for it, I took a wrong
turn and struggled to find my building
on an unfamiliar street. That’s why I’m studying:
There is my own blue bicycle; the round planter to the left
of the steps I use to enter, which the downstairs neighbor keeps
tidy—cutting back the plants that don’t stay green
in the winter, for example, but keeping the heartier cabbages
watered—though I have never seen her do this work;
somewhere between two and five pride flags,
some of which are there year round while others
appear only in June; a fire hydrant; the windows
of the apartment that face mine, through which I see my least
favorite bookshelves: they look mildly expensive
and comprise a set of intersecting diamonds, making the books
hard to remove and reshelf since they are all piled at slants;
some scaffolding that seems to attract unhappy couples mid-fight;
one set of table and chairs; a house that frequently puts books
or toys or clothes out on the sidewalk for free. I know that
there are two or more remarkable sculptures, but only
because I remember remarking: one might be of a silver
bust of a woman, maybe an angel or a pop star, while others
are definitely at the base of the railings to the steps across the street, but I don’t
remember now if they are dogs or birds. There is a statue of an owl
on a window ledge I can see from one chair, and it often scares me.
Now some buildings have Christmas lights, but I couldn’t say
which, and that could easily lead me to turn down any other residential
block. There is a lilac bush immediately next door, and in May, it helped me
identify my building from very far away. But when we came
to pick up our keys, I began to cry—it resembles
another that grew in front of my childhood and I am
sentimental. I sat down and demanded my roommate tell me
why he hadn’t pointed out the lilacs earlier, and he threw up
his hands: he had tried, but I had talked over him.
When the kisser who recommended I take snapshots
of my surroundings came to my apartment, there is a chance
that they noticed many more things: they probably know
whether it is broken up at any point by vinyl siding, or what words
appear on the inflatable Santa down the hill. When we passed
through the park, I did attempt to capture the snow lifting
from the ground in spirals, the two bodies—one seated, one running—blocking
some light, the corner-eye view of their metallic jacket. But I wanted
to remember what we looked like to the seated person, so replaced the above
description with an imagined photo of two people connected
by elbows, which I now see instead.
My panic, when it comes in public, starts
with lost vision; at home, with the heart. The classroom used to turn
to white: I could make out, maybe, the light from the streetlamps
visible from the class’ windows, but the shapes of the students’ faces
and the windows themselves would be gone. I got very good
at remembering where I had left my chair, sitting down, and pretending
to glance thoughtfully at my notebook. If I said “yes, mmhmm,
anyone else?” my students would feel prompted to speak
without raising hands, and sometimes I’d take illegible
notes on their comments in order to prolong the period
before I would need my eyesight back. If no voices emerged, but
I could register the electronic sounds enough to know my hearing
was still with me, I would spontaneously become a person
who lectures, or I would ask them to break into groups of 3-4
to collectively answer some question. Years before, when sound
and sight left together, I would sit on the floor
of the subway hoping to faint from a more auspicious
starting position. Looking at things indirectly—on a telephone,
say—does not typically produce such a reaction."
Untitled Fragment,"And as the procession
before me fled one seemed to
know as one whose years the mask
and smokeless altars interpose
incessantly

SHAPE whose garments in the changing
seasons as yet formless against
the trembling like the

From “Defacing the Monument”,"The words “economic,” “family,” and “asylum” remain unspoken as I sit in the back of the courtroom scribbling on a legal pad, trying to structure a context and trace my relation to the seven men who stand before the judge shackled at the wrists, waists, and ankles.
Reader, can you improvise your relation to the phrase “illegal entry,” to the large seal of US District Court, District of Arizona, that hangs above the judge, eagle suspended with talons and arrows pointing?
Perhaps your relation stretches like a wall, bends like footprints towards a road, perhaps your relation spindles and barbs, chollas or ocotillos, twists like a razor wire on top of a fence.
Perhaps you do not improvise, perhaps you shackle, you type, you translate, you prosecute, you daily wage, your mouth goes dry when you speak—paper, palimpsests of silence, palimpsests of complicity and connection never made evident on the page.
Write down everything you need. How long is the list?
Sleep with it beneath your head, eat it, wear it.
Can you use it to make a little shade from an unrelenting gaze?
Speak into the court record the amount of profit extracted from such men as those before the judge shackled at the wrists, waists, and ankles not limited to the amount of profit that will be extracted from such bodies through the payments that will be made per prisoner per day to the Corrections Corporation of America and GEO Group, but also inclusive of all the profits generated by trade agreements that makes labor in the so-called developing countries so cheap.
Best of luck to you, the judge says.
Que le vaya bien, the lawyers say as the men begin their slow procession out of the courtroom in chains.
And in that moment, from the back of the courtroom, we can decide to accept or forget what we have seen, to bear it, or to change it
because we love it, we want it, we don’t care enough to stop it, we hate it,
we can’t imagine how to stop it, we can’t imagine it, we can’t imagine."
Q.,"One of the four Royal Stars is watching over me.  Yeah, I’m blessed in these times of nervous weather.  The leaves chill in a bundle then scatter like police, off to the next doorstep.  They don’t step, they don’t faze me.  These jeans could hold three men.  But it’s just one of me, girl.  Only Son.  Only Sound.  Only Seer.  All this green to gold to red to orange is just theater.   I’m the Real.  Keep your eyes on the Navigator of Snow and Infinite Gray.  I rock these boots all year.  What a storm got to do with me? Who knows the number of strolls to heaven?  Not that I’m thinking on it.  The Heavens know my real name.  But you can call me Q.   Quicker than Q.  But, anyway.   Certain things a man keeps to himself.  Jesus wept.  So I don’t. The past is for people who like to play things over and over.  Me, I’m on to the next song. Listen to my own Head Symphony, to the Royal Stars.  The colors, they thrill me, they fuel these legs."

Where There’s Ice,"translated from the German by Pierre Joris
Where there’s ice, it’s cool for two.
For two: so I let you come.
A breath as of fire was around you—
You came from where the rose is.
I asked: what did they call you back there?
You told it to me, that name:
a glare as of ashes coated it—
From where the rose is you came.
Where there’s ice, it’s cool for two:
I gave you the double name.
You opened your eye beneath it—
A luster lay over the hole in the ice.
Now I close, is what I said, my own—:
Take this word—my eye spoke it to yours!
Take it, repeat it after me,
repeat it after me, say it slowly,
say it slowly, draw it out,
and your eye—keep it open the while!

Wo Eis Ist
Wo Eis ist, ist Kühle für zwei.
Für zwei: so ließ ich dich kommen.
Ein Hauch wie von Feuer war um dich—
Du kamst von der Rose her.
Ich fragte: Wie hieß man dich dort?
Du nanntest ihn mir, jenen Namen:
ein Schein wie von Asche lag drauf—
Von der Rose her kamst du.
Wo Eis ist, ist Kühle für zwei:
ich gab dir den Doppelnamen.
Du schlugst dein Aug auf darunter—
Ein Glanz lag über der Wuhne.
Nun schließ ich, so sprach ich, das meine—:
Nimm dieses Wort—mein Auge redet’s dem deinen!
Nimm es, sprich es mir nach,
sprich es mir nach, sprich es langsam,
sprich’s langsam, zögr es hinaus,
und dein Aug—halt es offen so lang noch!"
Dark Eye in September,"translated by Pierre Joris
Stonehood Time. And lusher do
the locks of pain well up around earth’s face,
the drunk apple, browned by the breath
of a sinful saying: fair and averse to the game
they play in the baleful
afterglow of their future.
A second time the chestnut blooms:
a sign of the poorly enkindled
hope for Orion’s
quick return: the star-clear
fervor of heaven’s blind friends
calls him near.
Unconcealed at the gates of the dream
a lonely eye contends.
What happens daily
is all it needs to know:
at the eastern window
nomad-figure of feeling.
Into the wet of its eye you dip your sword.
 
Dunkles Aug Im September
Steinhaube Zeit. Und üppiger quellen
die Locken des Schmerzes ums Antlitz der Erde,
den trunkenen Apfel, gebräunt von dem Hauch
eines sündigen Spruches: schön und abhold dem Spiel,
das sie treiben im argen
Widerschein ihrer Zukunft.
Zum zweitenmal blüht die Kastanie:
ein Zeichen der ärmlich entbrannten
Hoffnung auf Orions
baldige Rückkunft: der blinden
Freunde des Himmels sternklare Inbrunst
ruft ihn herauf.
Unverhüllt an den Toren des Traumes
streitet ein einsames Aug.
Was täglich geschieht,
genügt ihm zu wissen:
am östlichen Fenster
erscheint ihm zur Nachtzeit die schmale
Wandergestalt des Gefühls.
Ins Naß ihres Auges tauchst du das Schwert."
Written After a Massacre in the Year 2018,"There is no country to claim you when you die inside the word 
There is no language to claim you when die inside the cage  
The exiled cage breathes death at us 
The cage of exile heaves private air at us
Look 
Don’t speak now 
Just look 
Breathe into the mouth of the wound 
Dream into the foreclosure of your death 
Look into the vulture of your wound 
Look into the spider of your wound 
Look closely into the algorithm that determines the depth of your wound 
Whisper into the cage of exile 
You have nothing to lose but this breath 
Look
Into the breath in your breath 
Look     into the absent body in your breath 
Look     into the absent I in your body 
Look     into the absent you in your body 
No dust on your body no wound on your body no breath on your body no word on your body no fat on your body no arm on your body no tongue no shadow no rupture no breath no thought no cage no exile no word no code no silence 
Look
At the broken shadow in your broken shadow 
Look 
At the flooded street in your flooded street 
Look      into the economy of your absence and whisper into the code you cannot speak 
Look      into the silence of the code
Do not speak directly of the breath 
Do not speak directly of the suicide
Do not speak directly of the kids who tossed themselves into the river
Do not speak directly of the state that paid the kids to toss themselves into the river 
Breathe the privatized wind     breathe through the foreclosure of your mouth  
Breathe the broken shadow into the broken shadow 
Don’t take the money into the cage or they will kill you before it is time to kill you 
Pray gently into the privatization of your absence 
Die gently into the privatization of your absence
Pray gently into the accumulation of your absence
Die gently into the cage where the babies cry in your absence
Pray gently into the puffed-up corpses who grow and grow in your absence
The only breath in this cage is death "
Sonnet for a Tall Flower Blooming at Dinnertime,"Southern Flower, I want to quote the bard,
to serenade you, to raise a glass to you.
Long & tall you are always parched
& hungry. You wobble in strong winds, you
puff your bright hair when it rains, you
toss off the lint of dandelions, you
lean into the evening haunts
with your indifferent afro. You
were born in the old-world city, the invisible
dark girl city, the city that couldn’t hold
a candle, a straight pin, a slave-owner’s sins
to you. You are the most beautiful
            dark that hosts the most private sorrows
            & feeds the hungriest ghosts."
W 177th & Broadway,"All night you eyed the man I wanted to be;
my jaw flexed tight. Anger slipped into
desire. Easily he would rise. Easily you would
disperse, pleasure made into light:
what you want under him,
I put on to amuse—I, your worked
supplicant. Yes, love is looking away.
My desire greened in your dismissal. Was
technicolor and twilight-made and never
turning off. The city air hung humid
above our charade. What need I could fill:
to transubstantiate, to unravel?"
Club 2718,"Because I don’t have the juice or enough gold anything to enter, a room that occasionally exists inside of me is the poorly lit dance floor of Club 2718. Thirst is a way of knowing, not knowing. I was on a gin fueled hunt for big asses and music I could cry to. A woman almost twice my age asks where I’ve been and she shuts the door. Like any american what haunts me is my addiction to private property, not time or blackness. I want to love no one in particular the way I say I love my woman when she’s in the doorway and mad at me. There were days I believed my grandfather owned my grandmother kept her overfed and out of the sun in the back room. Occasionally a room exists inside of me where Johnny Hartman & John Coltrane’s “One and Only Love” plays on repeat. On repeat too is a video of my grandfather dancing a limber legged shuffle and singing across the wall to my grandmother. To love like him is to be a student of regret. To abide by regret is to watch grief turn to ecstasy. I wept in the winter when I left my woman, I wept in the heat when she came back."
Nocturne,"What was rampant in me was not wisteria. Perhaps decay, or loss of reflection.
No one like me gets old, or so I thought, even as I watched the days fade into each other.
Was I no one? Which phrase means a grown-up girl: mica-gilded; pure myth; gone?
Thoreau might say I was trying to find the door to nothingness, that the wild was already in me.
However, I walked out my bed to find my skin, only to return moondrunk, bramble-laden,
stripped to sinew, a broken syntax. No denying how I got here, I laid down among the tall grass
and came up a specter. I came up everywhere."
States of Decline,"The room is dying honey and lemon rind.
Soured light. My grandmother sits in her chair
sweetening into the blue velvet. Domestic
declension is the window that never opens—
the paint peeling, dusting the sill, and inhaled.
It is an american love she lives in,
my grandmother, rigored to televangelists
and infomercials. Losing the use of her legs.
Needing to be turned like a mattress.
No one is coming for her. The dog is
asleep in the yard, Her husband,
obedient to the grease and garlic
in the cast iron, salting her
death in the wind house."
8th & Ingraham,"I forget about money watching the clouds over 8th and Ingraham. The clouds a rhubarb-colored ship in the sky. To my right it all grays out, the bats emerging now from the chimneys. The bats listening for the cicadas’ echo. Echo is a way to create space, is a metaphor for time. Time for the cop to move along I think watching the cop watch me from my porch. Fuck 12. The robin on the wirevine the wireeye competing with the bats for cicadas. The robin competing reds with the sky. The sky a money for the cicadas: a way to make space, time. The cicadas sounding out the future through repetition. A friend says to spend nothing is to keep flexibility in your hands, to keep your youth. Money the sound of decay. Money the repetition of waste."
Art Movie,"Red is a secret in the trees. The train passes through the trees in Alabama. Red earth red earth. The winterlight consumes the field. The light silvers. The light relieves. The light thrown as dust upon the field I put my ear in. I crack an egg, and a saxophone that tells on me, yells at me, comes out no yolk. The train hollers to stop. The train stopped, still loads new passengers, but the conductor won’t let me get off and kiss you. You know that’s what I haunted to do. The stage is the window circle between us. The emergency exit door. I keep you in my ear and give you how I’m doing and what I want to eat were I not on a train. You and your white boots. You tell me what else could come out of an egg—women all the way down, holding waists. The train is a place going by, strictly passing through. I touch a stranger’s wrist going back to my seat, the whole train becomes a garment I put on. I touch indiscriminately. I can’t stay, I tell the dog waving from your convertible. None of the windows open. I held your gaze until I couldn’t. In the previous scene, I took you to the slip until we were shining tunnels for sound. I took your sound for my name. Never asked what I called myself."
Go-Go Ode,"O capacious room,
give me your tongues.
I’m done with being self
possessed. Take hold, turn
the river in me. I’m freed
up to be anybody else,
my molecules twinned
with the sound. O erotic ours,
pass me not. Keep me in
the pocket. O percussive
dissent, devotion is anything you
say go awry. In this early hour,
keep me recursive. The impulse is
to lose my feet. I’m yet overcome.
You seismic drop.
You sovereign fade.
O black chaos, I’m in study
at your center, turn me out."
"Count the Almonds,","translated by Pierre Joris
count what was bitter and kept you awake,
count me among them:
I searched for your eye, when you opened it and no one looked at you,
I spun that secret thread,
along which the dew you thought
slid down to the jars,
watched over by a saying that found its way to no one’s heart.
Only there did you wholly enter the name that is yours,
did you step sure-footed toward yourself,
did the hammers swing free in the belfry of your silence,
the overheard reach you,
the dead put its arm around you too,
and all three of you walked through the evening.
Make me bitter.
Count me among the almonds.
  Zähle die Mandeln,
zähle, was bitter war und dich wachhielt,
zähl mich dazu:
Ich suchte dein Aug, als du’s aufschlugst und niemand dich ansah,
ich spann jenen heimlichen Faden,
an dem der Tau, den du dachtest,
hinunterglitt zu den Krügen,
die ein Spruch, der zu niemandes Herz fand, behütet.
Dort erst tratest du ganz in den Namen, der dein ist,
schrittest du sicheren Fußes zu dir,
schwangen die Hämmer frei im Glockenstuhl deines Schweigens,
stieß das Erlauschte zu dir,
legte das Tote den Arm auch um dich,
und ihr ginget selbdritt durch den Abend.
Mache mich bitter."
Corona,"translated by Pierre Joris
Autumn eats its leaf out of my hand: we are friends.
We shell time from the nuts and teach it to walk:
time returns to the shell.
In the mirror is Sunday,
in the dream we sleep,
the mouth speaks true.
My eye goes down to my lover’s sex:
we gaze at each other,
we speak of dark things,
we love each other like poppy and memory,
we sleep like wine in the seashells,
like the sea in the moon’s blood-beam.
We stand and embrace at the window, they watch us from the street:
it is time, for this to be known!
It is time that the stone took the trouble to bloom,
that unrest’s heart started to beat.
It’s time for it to be time.
It is time.
  Corona
Aus der Hand frißt der Herbst mir sein Blatt: wir sind Freunde.
Wir schälen die Zeit aus den Nüssen und lehren sie gehn:
die Zeit kehrt zurück in die Schale.
Im Spiegel ist Sonntag,
im Traum wird geschlafen,
der Mund redet wahr.
Mein Aug steigt hinab zum Geschlecht der Geliebten:
wir sehen uns an,
wir sagen uns Dunkles,
wir lieben einander wie Mohn und Gedächtnis,
wir schlafen wie Wein in den Muscheln,
wie das Meer im Blutstrahl des Mondes.
Wir stehen umschlungen im Fenster, sie sehen uns zu von der Straße:
es ist Zeit, daß man weiß!
Es ist Zeit, daß der Stein sich zu blühen bequemt,
daß der Unrast ein Herz schlägt.
Es ist Zeit, daß es Zeit wird.
Es ist Zeit."
Evolution,"The corpses weigh nothing, nearly nothing, even your breath
is breeze enough to scatter them
We steamed them in tupperware with a damp sponge
then we tweezed the stiff wings open
The wing colors would brush off if you touched them
3,000 butterflies raised and gassed
and shipped to Evolution, the store in New York
rented by an artist hired to design a restaurant
He wanted to paper the walls with butterflies
Each came folded in its own translucent envelope
We tweezed them open, pinned them into rows
on styrofoam flats we stacked in towers in the narrow
hallway leading to the bathroom
Evolution called itself a natural history store
It sold preserved birds, lizards, scorpions in lucite, bobcat
with the eyes dug out and glass ones fitted, head turned
Also more affordable bits like teeth
and peacock feathers, by the register
a dish of raccoon penis bones
This was on Spring
The sidewalks swarmed with bare-armed people
there to see the city
You could buy your own name in calligraphy
or written on a grain of rice
by someone at a folding table
Souvenir portraits of taxis and the Brooklyn Bridge
lined up on blankets laid over the pavement
The artist we were pinning for had gotten famous
being first to put a dead shark in a gallery

For several million dollars each he sold what he described 
as happy pictures which were rainbow dots assistants painted 
on white canvases

I remember actually thinking his art confronted death,
that’s how young I was
We were paid per butterfly
The way we sat, I saw the backs
of the other pinners’ heads more than their faces
One’s braids the color of wine, one’s puffy headphones, feather cut
and slim neck rising from a scissored collar, that one
bought a raccoon penis bone on lunch break
Mostly we didn’t speak

Another life glimpsed in a detail mentioned, leaving or arriving 

She lived with a carpenter who fixed her lunches

Come fall I’d be in college
I smelled the corpses on my fingers when I took my smoke break
leaning against a warm brick wall facing the smooth white headless
mannequins in thousand-dollar shift dresses
The deli next door advertised organic toast and raisins on the vine
Mornings, I tried to learn from eyeliner
and shimmer on faces near mine on the train
Warm fogged imprint on a metal pole
where someone’s grip evaporated

Everyone looking down when someone walked through 
asking for help
At Evolution, talk radio played all day
A cool voice giving hourly updates
on the bombing of another city which it called
the conflict
The pinner in headphones sometimes hummed
or started a breathy lyric
“Selfish girl—”
I watched my tweezers guide the poisonous exquisite
blue of morpho wings
Their legs like jointed eyelashes
False eyes on the grayling wingtips
to protect the true face
The monarch’s wings like fire
pouring through a lattice"
mountain language,"the day after the mulberry tree fell on its belly, the army bombed a truck
full of black umbrellas sent from russia against the tyranny of rain. they
said, the black umbrellas are no longer allowed in the mountains. hats
are. guns are. gods are. the trees are offensive to the sky. then
they called our language mountain, then they pronounced it dead.
we are in a dream, you said. undo the pain before you speak
against the gods with mouths full of rain. a tongue cut in half
becomes sharper, you said. date your wound."

She Told Me the Earth Loves Us,"She said it softly, without a need 
for conviction or romance.
After everything? I asked, ashamed. 
That's not the kind of love she meant.
She walked through a field of gray 
beetle-pored pine, snags branching
like polished bone. I forget sometimes
how trees look at me with the generosity 
of water. I forget all the other 
breath I'm breathing in. 
Today I learned that trees can't sleep
with our lights on. That they knit 
a forest in their language, their feelings. 
This is not a metaphor. 
Like seeing a face across a crowd, 
we are learning all the old things, 
newly shined and numbered. 
I'm always looking 
for a place to lie down
and cry. Green, mossed, shaded. 
Or rock-quiet, empty. Somewhere
to hush and start over. 
I put on my antlers in the sun. 
I walk through the dark gates of the trees. 
Grief waters my footsteps, leaving 
a trail that glistens. "
November,"If I can’t save us
then let me feel you
happy and safe 
under my chin. 
If this will drown 
or burn 
then let us drink starlight
nap under trees
sing on beaches—
the morning rush to sit indoors
what, again? 
If we are dying
then let me rip open
and bleed Love,
spill it, spend it
see how much 
there is
the reward for misers is 
what, again? 
If this life is ending
then let me begin 
a new one "
Burial of the Sardine,"Giannina: I’m burying the sardine—the dead body I carry on my back.
Zarathustra: A little fish—in a little coffin. And for this—for this little stinky
thing—we came from so far?
Giannina: Look, it’s moving. It’s still alive.
Zarathustra: It’s so salty and ugly it itches and bites.
Giannina: It worked its whole life in the sludge of oil and vinegar. I’ll sprinkle
incense, myrrh, and a pound of gold to be buried with it under the
sand.
Hamlet: Hurry up. The ferry will leave without us.
Giannina: You have no idea how much I’ve suffered under the influence of
this rigorous but retarded sardine. Not a warrior, but a soldier. Making me
vow to its regiment of passive-aggressive work. No traveling was allowed.
No smoking allowed. No pets allowed. No one could get near me
because the sardine would stink—and its stink would bite. Sometimes it
would fly around the rim, but it would always dive back into the can
sardines—looking for its paycheck. Every two weeks—it brought me a
salary—the stinky sardine—and I brought home all I could buy with that
salary—confinement, imprisonment. Depending on a salary made me
salivate—but it blew my mind to dust—the dust that blows around and
makes you cough—but you hardly can see it because it’s made of dust. But
I’m not made of dust—I’m made of flesh—and making love to the little
sardine drove me crazy. It was such a little fish it barely filled my mouth. I
could hardly eat it. I grew hungry—hungry for a big fish. God help me—no
more fish! Please no clams, no oysters! Please—nothing shelled or scaled!
Nothing salted—nothing finned or fanged! Because it had fangs—the
sardine had fangs—and it bit me like a rabid squirrel. It must have known I
wanted to bury it. Its fangs were long—and its screams were shrill—and it
held grudges—and it had bones to pick. It blamed me for keeping it
down—but all I wanted was its liberation from the can. I wanted it to
breathe clean air—and to sing. Your mouth is already open—now take a
deep breath, little fishy, and sing—sing a song of love. You know my cords
are made of vibrant colors. You know I too come from the sea—but I don’t
come with grudges in my fangs. I come with wings to fly from your stink. I
hate sardines.
Zarathustra: Then why do you eat them?
Giannina: Because I detest their helplessness. I wouldn’t eat a lion. It would
eat me first. I eat what is weaker than me. I like lamb. I watch a grazing
lamb, and my mouth waters. I could eat it alive. But not sardines. They’re
already dead. They never lived. They’re dead even when they’re alive.
Always with their mouths open. Begging for water. And I don’t mind
beggars. But sardines are not beggars—they’re squirmers. They beg for
water—but what they really want is to eat you alive—with their
deadliness—which is a plague—a virus—bacteria—something contagious
that kills you without killing you. They open their mouths to beg for
water—but do nothing but gulp the draught and wait for water—with their
mouths
open—as if snoring, which is worse than imploring—they’re beggarly
beggars that don’t even beg—they’re too dead to beg—and they’re deadly
contagious. It’s their deadliness that lingers over me every day of my
life—the dead inertia of the sardine that obeys and begs for water, gallons
of
water, and does what it’s asked to do in spite of no water and denies itself
so much—that it doesn’t realize it doesn’t have a being anymore—and it
lets itself be canned—always with its open mouth saying:
—Drop dead, but give me drops of water. I don’t want to be buried
alive. I want to survive. I’m a salaried sardine. Give me more money.
That’s why they’re so salty and ugly, they itch and bite. Because they’re
salivating for salty salaries—salty salaried sardines.
Zarathustra: It is not a sardine. It is a big fish.
Giannina: The coffin is small, but the stench is immense."
September 11,"Banks are the temples of America.

Tongue Machine,"I’m in exile from the mother tongue—in exile from the foreign tongue—in
exile from all the tongues that wag with the familiarity of knowing—with the
credibility and the certainty—and without any kind of doubt that this is their
town and country. I laugh out loud—and my laughter is as mother tongue
as any laughter in any foreign tongue—but the joke is on me—because my
laughter is not cheering for the other team which is roasting the barbaric
tongue over an open flame of racist jokes and innuendoes—which is what
the mother of all eggs laid in the foreign tongue wants—to leave me
speechless—without a motherland—a land to mother my thoughts or a bed
to lie down in."
A Toast to Divine Madness,"(in the crown of the Statue of Liberty)
With this glass of champagne—I propose a toast to Divina Locura—Divine
Madness that has always inspired the higher expectations of the great
poets throughout the globe. And I propose raising to this magnificent
crown—Divine Madness that, like the oppressed everywhere, has been
kept down—in submission, in seclusion, deprivation, and silence—and has
been kept down by the antithesis of Divine Madness, divine expectation,
divine philosophy, and poetry—by the enemies of greatness and the lovers
of entertainment who have spit in the eyes and slapped the cheeks of
poetry and philosophy—with the cheapening of the heart—the cheapening
of all that is high and noble—the cheapening of all the greatness, the
magnificence, the beauty, the good, the noble, the suspension of the
senses, the charisma, and the good energy that spells, through our good
will, something good for America—something that makes America rise again
from the tippy-top of the Yukon to the tippy-toe of la Tierra del Fuego."
Miracles,"—There are more things in heaven and earth than are dreamed in your
philosophy.
—Like what?
—Like miracles—like changes of power—like changes in climate—like
political climates collapsing like polar ice caps—like the dungeon becoming
the crown and the crown the dungeon—like not paying attention to
bullies—like superpowers running out of fuel—like finding oil in the
dungeon of liberty—like the dungeon of liberty becoming a gold mine—like
useless poets changing the way the world thinks and sings—like a voice
coming out of the dungeon—a useless voice that has something to say but
doesn’t know how to market it—like finding yourself for the first time
happy—even though you’re in prison. Like finding camaraderie and
solidarity among friends you never thought could be your friends. Like
understanding the other—not loving the other—but putting yourself in the
shoes of the other—not to take their position—not to steal what the other
has—but to feel what the other feels—to appreciate his thoughts. Not to be
ironic—clever—smart—but to be profound—not to be the boss who puts
everybody down—but to be the leader of a chorus of voices—each and
every single one of them having their own point of view—like saying—stop being a predicate and become a subject."
"Saluda al sol, araña","If I respected languages like you do, I wouldn’t write at all. El muro de
Berlín fue derribado. Why can’t I do the same. Desde la torre de Babel, las
lenguas han sido siempre una forma de divorciarnos del resto de la
humanidad. Poetry must find ways of breaking distance. I’m not reducing
my audience. On the contrary, I’m going to have a bigger audience with the
common markets–in Europe–in America. And besides, all languages are
dialects that are made to break new grounds. I feel like Dante, Petrarca
and Boccaccio, and I even feel like Garcilaso forging a new language.
Saludo al nuevo siglo, el siglo del nuevo lenguaje de América, y le digo
adiós a la retórica separatista y a los atavismos.
Saluda al sol, araña,
no seas rencorosa.

Soy Boricua,"Soy boricua. In spite of my family and in spite of my country—I’m writing
the process of the Puerto Rican mind—taking it out of context—as a native
and a foreigner—expressing it through Spanish, Spanglish, and
English—Independencia, Estado Libre Asociado, and Estadidad—from the
position of a nation, a colony, and a state—Wishy, Wishy-Washy, and
Washy—not as one political party that is parted into piddly parts and
partied out. Todos los partidos están partidos y son unos partidos."
"Poem from Pastoral; or, the Inquisition of Memories (Memories walk around dressed as old men.)","translated by Tess O’Dwyer
Memories walk around dressed as old men. But they’re not old. They’re
hypocrites and gossipers. I love gossip. But I hate memories and sorrows. I
like the he told me and I told him and we fell in love and rode off into the
sunset and lived happily ever after. I like the sun and the beach. I like
sidewalks. And soup and beets. I like men and women. And I like
mountains and seas. I like fire and water. I like trashy movies and novels. I
like tackiness and gossip. Most of all, I like to forget everything. Especially
memories. I am forgetfulness. And nothingness. I am joy, well-being, and
happiness. I am laughter, gossip, and pantomime. I am the idiot and the
prince. I am the grain of rice and the bean. I am the chickpea and the
casserole. I am the red apple. And salt and pepper. I am the shepherd of
life. I am the shepherd of memories, which I love despite everything.
Affirming is everything I love and everything I hate. Affirming. And living.
And denying. Affirming everything."
"A Poem from Pastoral; or, the Inquisition of Memories (I make the affirmation.)","translated by Tess O’Dwyer
I make the affirmation. I make the exclamation. I am the inquisition of
memories. And I am bored by semicolons. I am bored by doubt. And above
all, by memory. I am bored by memories and have reached the top of the
world to burn them. My memories are in this book. Listen to me, ladies and
gentlemen. This is the funeral of memories. This is their cemetery. This is
their funeral service. I don’t adore them or respect them at all. They belong
to no one. They don’t belong to the grave. They don’t even belong to
memory. You’ve all seen red chimeras and black chimeras. And you’ve
seen drunkenness and banquets. And afterwards the hangover of memory
came and swept away life. Death is called memory. And so is time. And so
are the damned garbage collectors. I mean the shepherds of memory. And
memories are shadows. And memories are death. I am not a memory. I am
not an arsenal of epithets or metaphors. I am the star, and the star shines. I
am affirmation. And I do not want concepts. I do not want abstractions. No,
no, no, and no. I am not a semicolon. I want a new paragraph. I want to
end it all, once and for all. Without any regrets. Without memories."
Little Lead Soldiers,"translated by Tess O’Dwyer
My tanks were filled with gasoline and wars. I was a lead soldier. I marched
against the smoke of the city. There were difficult moments and there were,
Hello! How are you? They were all worth the same. I had two pennies. I
could enter the city. But they closed the doors on me. I closed my soul on
them. They didn’t know what had happened. Did my soul pass by here?
Body, I said to you, how are you? I have been a lead soldier. The voice that
said it was not what it said. I almost swear by the road. But the segment,
the march loaded with clay, eyes of asphalt, hands of lime, legs of drill,
navels of cement, resounded, resounded, resounded—the anvils of the
hammer against the beams of the body—drilling, drilling, drilling me.
Marching in time, the wall and the latch, the heart, my soul, the precipice of
the trucks. And everything was black, black, black, white—like the asphalt.
And the world closed its doors—anvils and hammers against the sleeping
men—the doors of the heart, cities everywhere and little lead soldiers."
I Have Been a Fortune Teller,"translated by Tess O’Dwyer
I have been a fortune-teller. Ages ago, I told the fortune of buffoons and
madmen. You remember. I had a small voice like a grain of sand and
enormous hands. Madmen walked over my hands. I told them the truth. I
could never lie to them. And now I am sorry. Ages ago, a drunkard filled
with dreams asked me to dance. I used my cards to tell his fortune when
his drinks became blows. My banging on the door killed the sea. Memories
finished us. Madmen and buffoons count the grains of sand and have never
destroyed night’s dreams. They draw up the night and rise filled with
middays. Magicians were and always will be my companions. Without
guessing their tricks I started fire in their throats. But none explode. Maybe
one. And with the fish another chimera rises."
Poetry is This Screaming Madwoman,"translated from the Spanish by Tess O’Dwyer
(ars poetica)
Poetry is this screaming madwoman. Everything seems poetry. Madmen
gaze high. Everything seems madness. Madmen fear no moon, fear no fire.
Burns of flesh are poetry. Madmen’s wounds are poetry. The witch’s crime
was poetry. Magic knew how to find its poetry. The star wasn’t poetry
before the madwoman discovered it. Discovery of fire in the star. Discovery
of water with sand. Neither poetry nor prose. Salt is for fish, salt is for
death, the poem is not among the dead. Remember, but don’t write it. Love
her duendes and act as her Lazarus, but don’t wake her. Sleepwalker
among cats, thief among dogs, man among women, woman among men,
blasphemous toward religion, fed up with poverty. Tear out poetry’s voice.
Don’t let her find you, hide. Disregard her, ignore her, forsake her. Don’t
touch her wounds, she’ll scorn you. Back away. Scorn the poem. Develop
without her. Give her the necessary distance. Let her feel conceited. Then
insult her for not having written with power. Deride her dreams, slap her
eyes. Kneel down and ask her forgiveness. Take the poem from her belly.
Sleep beside her, but don’t avert your eyes. Listen to what she tells you in
dreams. Acknowledge her when you see her spell the names of hell.
Descend with her into hell, climb her streets, burn within her history. There
are no names, no history. The volcano erupts and rushes toward the poem.
I can’t do anything but bash her against a rock. I can’t do anything but
embrace her. I can’t do anything but insult her dreams, and she can’t do
anything but open the poem for me, just a crack, a crack in silence, without
watchmen or maidens, with a fowl and an owl to keep distant, to keep
silent, to show up barefoot. And she couldn’t do anything but crash against
the rocks, and the wind couldn’t do anything but blow her locks, and time
couldn’t do anything but eternalize her moment. And poetry is nowhere in
the castle. She disappears through the trapdoor, escapes with the fire that
burns her and dissolves in water.
  La poesía es esta loca que grita
(Ars poetica in Spanish...)
La poesía es esta loca que grita. Todo parece poesía. Los locos miran alto.
Todo parece locura. Los locos no le temen a la luna, ni le temen al fuego.
Las quemaduras del cuerpo son poesía. Las heridas de los locos son
poesía. El crimen de la bruja fue poesía. La magia supo encontrar su
poesía. No era poesía la estrella antes de que la loca la descubriera.
Descubrimiento del fuego en la estrella. Descubrimiento del agua con la
arena, no es poesía ni es prosa. La sal es de los peces, la sal es de la
muerte, no está el poema en la muerte. Recuerda, pero no lo escribas.
Ámale los duendes, y sírvele de Lázaro, pero no la despiertes. Sonámbula
con los gatos, ladrona con los perros, hombre con las mujeres, mujer con
los hombres, blasfema con la religión, harta con la pobreza. Arráncale la
voz a la poesía. No dejes que te descubra, escóndete. No la pienses ni le
des importancia, abandónala. No le toques las heridas, te despreciará.
Apártate. Despréciale el poema. Desenvuélvete sin ella. Dale la ncesaria
distancia. Deja que se siente engreída. Entonces insúltala, por no haber
escrito con fuerza. Entonces ultrájale los sueños, abofetéale los ojos.
Arrodíllate y pídele perdón. Sácale el poema del vientre. Duérmete a su
lado, pero no la dejes de mirar. Escucha lo que en sueños te dice.
Reconócela cuando la veas deletrear los nombres del infierno. Desciende
con ella al infierno, sube por sus calles, arde dentro de su historia. No hay
nombres ni hay historia. Se precipita el volcán y la lava está deseosa de
introducirse en el poema. No puedo menos que estrellarla contra una roca,
no puedo menos que abrazarla. Ni puedo menos que insultarle los sueños,
ni puede menos que entreabrirme el poema, a medio decir, en silencio, sin
centinelas ni doncellas, con una lechuza y un buho para guardar la
distancia, para guardar el silencio, para presentarsedescalza. Y ella no
pudo menos que estrellarse contra la roca, y el viento no pudo menos que
soplarle los cabellos, y el tiempo no pudo menos que eternizar su
momento. Y la poesía no está en todo el castillo, desaparece por la puerta
defuga, se va con el fuego que la quema y se disuelve en agua."
Poetry of the Night,"translated by Tess O’Dwyer
Poetry of a shark with two whales and a scarecrow. Poetry of a crab and a
turtle. Poetry of an elevator and two cars. Poetry of a giant and a dwarf.
Poetry of the clown and the drunkard. Poetry of the star and the wall.
Poetry of the summer and the mountain. Poetry of the flying rabbit and the
dancing shoe. And poetry of the pain of joy and poetry of the joy of pain.
Poetry of the bat and the witch. Poetry of the torn shoe and the barefoot
stockings and the horizon that looks for you when you’re approaching the
mountain. And poetry of the hill you descend when you’re expecting the
call. And poetry of the number lost in the magician’s hat. And poetry of the
parakeet’s feather and poetry of the parrot and the parasol. And poetry of
the shadow and the witness. And poetry of the accident and the surprise.
And poetry of the love that never arrives because it escapes with the
magician’s hat. And the word poetry, and the sound poetry, and the
shadow poetry become two real numbers, two real clowns, two jumbo jets,
two cheers that no one hears because shattered in the air they cease being
air and shattered against the wind they cease being wind. And poetry
without mountain and without hill. And poetry without absence and without
emptiness. And poetry of the night and the witness in shadow, in dust, in
nothing."
Nostalgia,"translated by Tess O’Dwyer
Nostalgia is a fruit with the pain of distance in its seed."
Truth,"translated by Tess O’Dwyer
Yes, it’s true. Questions don’t change the truth. But they give it motion.
They focus my truth from another angle. And you said: we’re washing the
truth. Things must be clarified.
You don’t tell the truth and eventually your jacket comes back made of
another material, and your shoes say yes and run back to you telling my
truth. Though it’s raining now, it may not be raining inside your truth like it’s
raining outside. Though silent, you may be saying what I’m thinking when
you weren’t speaking. But don’t ignore me and then start up again saying
come when you said go. Then don’t expect me to listen when you say
come. You’ll come with your words get out and the door will open. I hear
those words and the door opens. Then you’ll come and I’ll know how to tell
you: get out."
A Letter Comes and Visits Me,"translated by Tess O’Dwyer
A letter comes and visits me. Puts its legs up in the living room. Wanders
about speechless. Suddenly it explodes and another shape appears.
Welcome! Swiftly it flees, and I see two, three, four, five, seven, five
hundred letters. Suddenly I hear the word river and water runs in another
river’s space. I repeat river two, three, four, five, seven, five hundred times,
and cold imprisons twilight. Then the twin slope of this letter trembles.
There is no bottomless return. The letter is born of life. That’s where its limit
began. I discover the world beneath."
Behind the Word is Silence,"translated by Tess O’Dwyer
Behind the word is silence. Behind what sounds is the door. There is a
back and a fold hiding in everything. And what was approaching fell and
stopped far away in proximity. An expression falls asleep and rises. And
what was over there returns. It’s a way to put the world back in its place.
And something comes back when it should remain remembering. 
But if I ring the bell, water jumps and a river falls out of the water again.
And the body rises and shakes. And the rock wakes and says I sing. And a
hand turns into a kerchief. And twilight and wind are companions. And this
twilight appears amid lightning. Outside there is a bird and a branch and a
tree and that lightning. Above all, there is noon without form. And suddenly
everything acquires movement. Two travelers meet and their shoes dance.
And breeze and morning clash. And the seagull runs and the rabbit flies.
And runs and runs, and the current ran. Behind what runs is life. Behind
that silence is the door."
"He, Too","Returning to the US, he asks
my occupation. Teacher.
What do you teach?
Poetry.
I hate poetry, the officer says,

Time-Lapse Video of Trans Woman Collapsing Inward Like a Dying Star,"I beg for invisible fire.
Every night I pray to love,
please invent yourself.
I imagine a place after this place
and I laugh quietly to no one
as the hair on my chin
weeds through old makeup.
When I go to sleep
I am vinegar inside clouded glass.
The world comes to an end
when I wake up and wonder
who will be next to me.
Police sirens and coyote howls
blend together in morning’s net.
Once, I walked out past the cars
and stood on a natural rock formation
that seemed placed there to be stood on.
I felt something like kinship.
It was the first time.
Once, I believed god
was a blanket of energy
stretched out around
our most vulnerable
places,
when really,
she’s the sound
of a promise

Melancholia,"The whirring internal machine, its gears
grinding not to a halt but to a pace that emits
a low hum, a steady and almost imperceptible
hum: the Greeks would not have seen it this way.
Simply put, it was a result of black bile,
the small fruit of the gall bladder perched
under the liver somehow over-ripened
and then becoming fetid. So the ancients
would have us believe. But the overly-emotional
and contrarian Romans saw it as a kind of mourning
for one’s self. I trust the ancients but I have never 
given any of this credence because I cannot understand
how one does this, mourn one’s self.
Down by the shoreline—the Pacific 
wrestling with far more important 
philosophical issues—I recall the English notion
of it being a wistfulness, something John Donne
wore successfully as a fashion statement.
But how does one wear wistfulness well
unless one is a true believer? 
The humors within me are unbalanced, 
and I doubt they were ever really in balance
to begin with, ever in that rare but beautiful
thing the scientists call equilibrium.
My gall bladder squeezes and wrenches, 
or so I imagine. I am wistful and morose
and I am certain black bile is streaming 
through my body as I walk beside this seashore.
The small birds scrambling away from the advancing 
surf; the sun climbing overhead shortening shadows; 
the sound of the waves hushing the cries of gulls: 
I have no idea where any of this ends up.
To be balanced, to be without either
peaks or troughs: do tell me what that is like…
This contemplating, this mulling over, often leads 
to a moment a few weeks from now,
the one in which everything suddenly shines
with clarity, where my fingers race to put down 
the words, my fingers so quick on the keyboard 
it will seem like a god-damned miracle."
Experiment with Aspic,"It commences. Here
   it is endless. Mostly
poverty. Parallel to
the railway track.
Manure, procession,
conniptions. It is crisp.
   A labyrinth. It is here
it commences. Lac,
it is said. Or albumen.
    Gourds, chikus, com-
prehensions of ripeness.
What’s fresh, what’s
   not, under the same
feckless auspices.
Luxury, it is said, moves,
    sometimes, at midday.
Mellow the light cast on
such euphemistic striations.
        On the goathooks
(up ahead), on the garlands
    (up ahead up ahead).
The muffled scene of death
to which the lines proceed,
curved. Citrus curling up
   the light, so tart it is.
   But here, here where it
commences, here, from where
the lines, endless, proceed,
    here the voices, here
the prices. Lacquer on this
produce, surreal photography,
tainted reverie. Nothing clean
yet, presence implied, not seen.
        It proceeds, an extreme
   intelligence can be held
in the hands, is. Slight burn
    from the citrus, slight build
from up the ground. Euphemism
    for shanty. Euphemism for
        indigence. Skinny body,
slender bean, sturdy drumsticks
   snap. Nothing clean, yet
the causal knives luxuriate.
Lone jackfruit, abandoned
beehive. Nightshade in terror
    of being shook. The lymph is
anxious. The child rears her
        ugly head, slow capacity
for memory. Lacquer, she says.
   Lacquer on this. This kind of
traffick is difficult to curb. Her skin
is light, her mother’s translucent.
    This is how it begins, the acts
of comprehending things, softening,
   into the basket, plastic,
        the voiceless hellos, a
      tendency, hushed.
   An impossible sculptural
    aspect her eyes laminate.
Things mature along
   this aisle that’s endless.
And she too, in the town
called Fraser, opposite
the police station and the
pork shop, parallel to the
railway track, she too
        developed symptoms,
    hysteria, depression,
     a deviant sexualized
    mesmerism. She told us,
not without resistance,
      that she had had an
   education. Her mother
spoke the apt languages.
She said nothing but lacquer.
   Lacquer on this. The brain
like a jelly, something trapped
        in it. She views it
with her double-eye, its
      glittering mound
   of curvatures, lipid-rich
      broth. We call it in the vulgar
gelatin. We will return to this point
later. For the child rears her head
to the sound of community, which
   she hears as tribe, later mafia.
    She appears to comprehend
but does not the sorrow
   of haggling. Whether she might
come to say it, let’s not insure.
   But it is here it commences.
The thickenings of lymph,
the persistent shyness, the passions.
        It is endless. As symbol, luxury,
she finds, and poverty are the same.
   She listens prodigally. Correlatives
    appear, disappear. She lacquers
them. But poverty, she finds, is,
    in act, in thought, a word, to her,
   not otherwise permitted, real.
Articulacy then was of elbows
    and knees. The spirit never quite
levels between her mother and
   the woman on the blue tarp,
but they touch hands. The mother
communes with nearly every one.
    The child rears her ugly head,
quizzical. Recrudescence
   that’s luscious, shutting down
institutes. Speak, she says, speak,
my heart is gelatin. If anything luxe
        is, it is this severe
unthinkable audio. Palatial,
   she says. In futures glorious
and systematic the word ATELIER
   will come to describe this
     pure fragment, this collapse of lines.
Curvatures, she thinks. Conniptions.
   The dusty, colloidal elegance, she
thinks, of air. She views it with her
        double-eye, sculptural aspect.
A powdery substance overlays things,
steady music. It is here she comes to
        comprehend, tender,
later, smell it. We call it in the vulgar
money. Speak, she speaks. The humors
reside not in but a quarter of an inch
   away from her, settling sometimes
as sweat. She was extraordinarily
    vulnerable, with not even a
rotten core. What might coerce her
   to nostalgia. Hot tea chilled jelly
dissolves. No quality here. It is
      nothing and the saw. The recrude-
scence is luscious, shuts down law.
   It began as tendency. Petty crime.
      Delirium of touching. Passion of
the silk. Subjective correlatives.
   Desire, dark wishes, ossifications,
   and abbreviations of sound. The
refusal to dance, the turning away
    inside the apostrophe. Meditative
processional. It got heavy. She
   lacquered it. She viewed it with her
      vulgar eye. She lacquered it.
         No delicacy obtained. She put it
   away in its pure future, glittering
mound. The opposite of hot tea
    and a biscuit. Lacquer on it.
Endless, mostly. Difficult to discern.
   The conniptions. Cognitions. This kind
of traffick is difficult to curb. But no,
       it did not affect her. No one was
             spirited away. This was not the meadow
         in which she grew. No one haggled,
    no one withdrew. It was as a lacquer
on her."
nation,"Steady now, a sense is pealing out the surface areas.
Observe here the fit expressions, as germane as botanic.
Here a faith in images still, and moving, you observe nothing quite
proves prosody but people feel rhythm in their bodies.
The body is pronounced bawdy.
And here a faith in materials I too cagily profess.
And then ‘the sense / faints.’
Fold this.
Steadily you discover exteriors. Fold them.
Continual and cheapened light of the electric kind suffuses most
areas in which you remain.
In some sense you are reporting on a country.
What do you observe?
You observe observation, its obstacles.
Forms of envy.
Narrative growing out the landscape constrainedly.
A seasonal negation inducing absence.
A relation blooms in this landscape full of abuses.
The people aren’t errant, they’re erratic.
Terror takes them.
The air is filled with amazing becomings, Marquezian butterflies.
Fold this.
This is not a truth but a way, a movement—simply—moving futures
into fuchsias."
Sidewalk Rage,"I’m not sure why but it’s taken forever for me to write this poem
I hope to remember all the pieces
But I’ve developed a new condition
One that’s come from age/I can no longer take the shit I once did
And there’s a part of my condition that comes from gentrification
And cell phone use
Living amidst tech zombies
And their general fear and hatred of People of color
My condition is called sidewalk rage
Kind of like road rage
But comes when walking down the street and there’s some millennial
Who has just moved into the neighborhood
who thinks its theirs
a little grown ass white girl who in broad daylight feels a dark presence
walking behind her
it’s me/minding my own business and she gets so panicked and paralyzed
she stops walking and holds her purse
with my new condition I yell
If you don’t want to live around Black people, get the fuck out of the neighborhood!
She is shocked.
Or in another scenario:
You see random white women on their phones
Standing in a doorway completely blocking it
Because you know only they exist
And you’re like HELLO, HELLO
Yes, all these years I thought I was still a small town girl and then suddenly
with my sidewalk rage, I’m a bonafide New Yorker
like the ones you’ve seen on bicycles banging on the hood of a taxi cab
that tries to cut them off
My person with sidewalk rage is a character of their own
Where once I was silent
Recently I confronted a man who was blocking my path/crossing the street
He had his head down and almost rammed into me
I sucked my teeth loud and shouted HELLO HELLO
He was so angry I’d confronted him he yelled, “Suck my dick”
I started to yell something profane but I stopped myself
And then I was in the subway/going downstairs and a white man rammed into me
on the phone,
My sidewalk rage kicked in and thought for a second to sneak behind him
And kick him down the stairs,
That’s my sidewalk rage/ I stopped myself.
I don’t know who this person is in me who would never speak up for herself
Was always soft and vulnerable
Who’s been at various times pickpocketed, blasphemed/body slammed,
ransacked, ridiculed
Who now has a voice
Who now lets rage show
Who couldn’t express herself
Has now become all angles and sharp edges."
Untitled,"Say what you want about my mother/ I know
her cruelty knew no bounds
neglect
never a warm hug
kind word
every year when school came/fall
I looked at the flyers of back to school clothes
Nothing
I wore rags/hand me downs
As soon as I worked she made me pay rent
and that was the message engraved into me
instead of being taught responsibility
I was taught I owed
her rent
the ground I stood on and had no rights
My father’s neglect
The patches put over his eyes
not to see
never a book
nothing
She suffered from mental illness
was selfish
Through blinds
Through stories I get glimpses
Say what you want but she is the greatest fighter
She is going now
She cobbles out a life from the women she watches on housewives shows
Their competition
My neighbor buys a wreath
My mother buys a bigger one
She tells my father when I visit
Strike up the barbeque
She buys corn
pretends it’s a party
I see she has lost weight this visit
the depression she believes there is a man coming to destroy things
and there are bugs
She constantly buys poison
I know I can’t talk to her about depression/the drugs
So I say as gently as I can
Keep your spirits up/ then you will gain back the weight
On the morning I am leaving
She dresses up in nice clothes
And a pair of coral earrings I gave her
She said she’d been skipping meals
But on the morning before I left
perhaps just as a child to show me
She piled her plate full of scrambled eggs with ketchup
And she ate."
Twizzlers,"Size color class I was never allowed to be little
And by little I mean innocent
By little I mean allowed to play
make mistakes
If anything occurred in whatever setting
I was always blamed
I was mistaken constantly for being older than I was
At 6 when my stepmother came she refused to
allow me alone time with my father
If a moment occurred she asked
What were you doing with him?
As if I at 6 were molesting my father
I was caught once through an open bathrobe
trying to see my father’s penis
My stepmother never forgot
You were trying to look at him, she said.
I was not given toys books anything
Stuffed animals
Bows ribbons anything that may be attached to a little girl
I was also my mother’s sounding board for her adult problems
with my Dad
Constantly instructed to call the police
when he hit her
The only thing my parents could figure out to do together
for some small infraction was to give me punishment
2 weeks
So I never knew the nurturance
that girls got
My adult life has duplicated this
always to blame
always outside
refusing to see my little girl
On occasion my mother sent me to the store to get candy
Things that she liked
Fire balls
Reese's peanut butter cups
Kit Kat bars
Black licorice
Sometimes red which I liked
Twizzlers
I remember once chewing a pack of red Twizzlers as an adult
the red stem hung out of my mouth
A friend at the time exclaimed
You're such a little girl …
And once when I was with a woman
Someone looked on and said oh
Your little girl is out
In relationships too I was never
the little girl
In fact in most of them I rescued radically immature women
I was their mother caretaker
the one with all responsibility
And of course when it ended I was always to blame
Everything to me lies around class race gender lines
Even in so called evolved communities
Even with people of color
I always know no one would treat a white skinned woman or a man the way I've been treated
In colleges where I teach
I'm always aware of the hierarchy
People screaming about diversity
I moan complain
How the Aids narrative only belongs to men
They never ask women
Black women
As if Aids didn't happen to us
Our fathers brothers sons nephews
Cousins acquaintances
The black gay boys in the choir
became our disappeared
I remember a pair of black gay men
who were spiritual
would act as ministers
and bury the dead black boys
families wouldn't recognize
These men showed up as the priests
and gave last rites
And what of the women
A mother nursing a grown son
returned to a baby
ravaged by Aids
Me being young myself going into sick wards
like leper colonies
seeing those abandoned by society
I never forgot
Even my era did not allow me to be little
innocent
A threat if I spoke up
A competitor for middle class white girls
who had the world handed to them
And resented me/you for surviving
thriving despite all odds."
Never Again,"At the end of every holocaust film I’ve seen and there
are not that many
they show real life survivors and the lines are
Never Again
and some of us like me/stare into these films
down long tunnels of history
wondering how it could have ever happened at all
that a leader and his minions could be so toxic, poisonous
you’d turn against your neighbors
and you could be so oblivious, brainwashed, scared
desperate to be superior or to survive
you’d do anything-or almost.
They say never again
but it is again
as I look at the deportations
round ups
I’m reminded of Idi Amin when he cast out foreigners
and Forest Whitaker in the film The Last King of Scotland/when he played him.
And to see it is again
at rallies, at protests, they show the coat hangers and crude instruments
women were forced to use in back alley abortions
We say never again but taking away women’s choice
and Planned Parenthood it is again.
Today started out in an argument with a so called fan
who didn’t understand why I mentioned race so much in my new book
and that white man is not the first/a black woman
asked too.
I wanted to scream HELLO haven’t you seen the news?
Didn’t you see what happened to Stephon Clark?
unarmed and shot in the back six times by police
And no one even cares what happens to women/
Black lesbians or lesbians of color
There’s no public outcry.
A student once wrote to me in an academic paper
that a parent forced her to stop playing sports
because they said sports made her more of a dyke
It murdered my student inside because she was an athlete
Yeah so the white guy I argued with about my book
said he was just giving me some good advice
from his experience as an empath
I said I don’t need your advice
I have reasons for talking about race and gender in the interpersonal
He said he was just trying to help me.
I’ll offer this non-sequitur
Winnie Mandela died a few weeks ago
She had great impact on me
I read she was nobility
But then of course the difference between her and say
how Princess Diana was treated
Everyone accepted and loved Diana’s silent/passive status
She was allowed to be gorgeous
No one ever associated her with that dirty colonial stain
There are moments in that recent Winnie Mandela doc that stand out to me
where she buried her face in her hands and screamed out
as I have so many times, “I’ve been betrayed”/the other moment
was when she said she was the only ANC member
brought to TRC and made to testify
Also that Nelson Mandela forgave a nation
but he could never forgive her.
I think what was done to Winnie
is also done to other Black women and working artists
Black women fighting to give language/resistance
but it only matters when a celebrity says or does it.
At Cape Coast Castle in Ghana after you’ve passed
the door of no return
there is a plaque donated to the Castle by Black tribal elders/it reads:
May we never sell ourselves into slavery again...
But it is Again."
Love in the City,"translated by Esther Allen
     Times of gorge and rush are these:
Voices fly like light: lightning,
like a ship hurled upon dread quicksand,
plunges down the high rod, and in delicate craft
man, as if winged, cleaves the air.
And love, without splendor or mystery,
dies when newly born, of glut.
The city is a cage of dead doves
and avid hunters! If men’s bosoms
were to open and their torn flesh
fall to the earth, inside would be
nothing but a scatter of small, crushed fruit!
     Love happens in the street, standing in the dust
of saloons and public squares: the flower
dies the day it’s born. The trembling
virgin who would rather death
have her than some unknown youth;
the joy of trepidation; that feeling of heart
set free from chest; the ineffable
pleasure of deserving; the sweet alarm
of walking quick and straight
from your love’s home and breaking
into tears like a happy child;—
and that gazing of our love at the fire,
as roses slowly blush a deeper color,—
Bah, it’s all a sham! Who has the time
to be noble? Though like a golden
bowl or sumptuous painting
a genteel lady sits in the magnate’s home!
     But if you’re thirsty, reach out your arm,
and drain some passing cup!
The dirtied cup rolls to the dust, then,
and the expert taster—breast blotted
with invisible blood—goes happily,
crowned with myrtle, on his way!
Bodies are nothing now but trash,
pits and tatters! And souls
are not the tree’s lush fruit
down whose tender skin runs
sweet juice in time of ripeness,—
but fruit of the marketplace, ripened
by the hardened laborer’s brutal blows!
     It is an age of dry lips!
Of undreaming nights! Of life
crushed unripe! What is it that we lack,
without which there is no gladness? Like a startled
hare in the wild thicket of our breast,
fleeing, tremulous, from a gleeful hunter,
the spirit takes cover;
and Desire, on Fever’s arm,
beats the thicket, like the rich hunter.
     The city appals me! Full
of cups to be emptied, and empty cups!
I fear—ah me!—that this wine
may be poison, and sink its teeth,
vengeful imp, in my veins!
I thirst—but for a wine that none on earth
knows how to drink! I have not yet
endured enough to break through the wall
that keeps me, ah grief!, from my vineyard!
Take, oh squalid tasters
of humble human wines, these cups
from which, with no fear or pity,
you swill the lily’s juice!
Take them! I am honorable, and I am afraid!
  Amor de Cuidad Grande
     De gorja son y rapidez los tiempos.
Corre cual luz la voz; en alta aguja,
Cual nave despeñada en sirte horrenda,
Húndese el rayo, y en ligera barca
El hombre, como alado, el aire hiende.
¡Así el amor, sin pompa ni misterio
Muere, apenas nacido, de saciado!
Jaula es la villa de palomas muertas
Y ávidos cazadores! Si los pechos
Se rompen de los hombres, y las carnes
Rotas por tierra ruedan, ¡no han de verse
Dentro más que frutillas estrujadas!
     Se ama de pie, en las calles, entre el polvo
De los salones y las plazas; muere
La flor que nace. Aquella virgen
Trémula que antes a la muerte daba
La mano pura que a ignorado mozo;
El goce de temer; aquel salirse
Del pecho el corazón; el inefable
Placer de merecer; el grato susto
De caminar de prisa en derechura
Del hogar de la amada, y a sus puertas
Como un niño feliz romper en llanto;—
Y aquel mirar, de nuestro amor al fuego,
Irse tiñendo de color las rosas,—
Ea, que son patrañas! Pues ¿quién tiene
tiempo de ser hidalgo? Bien que sienta,
Cual áureo vaso o lienzo suntuoso,
Dama gentil en casa de magnate!
     O si se tiene sed, se alarga el brazo
Y a la copa que pasa se la apura!
Luego, la copa turbia al polvo rueda,
Y el hábil catador—manchado el pecho
De una sangre invisible—sigue alegre
Coronado de mirtos, su camino!
No son los cuerpos ya sino desechos,
Y fosas, y jirones! Y las almas
No son como en el árbol fruta rica
En cuya blanda piel la almíbar dulce
En su sazón de madurez rebosa,—
Sino fruta de plaza que a brutales
Golpes el rudo labrador madura!
     ¡La edad es ésta de los labios secos!
De las noches sin sueño! ¡De la vida
Estrujada en agraz! Qué es lo que falta
Que la ventura falta? Como liebre
Azorada, el espíritu se esconde,
Trémulo huyendo al cazador que ríe,
Cual en soto selvoso, en nuestro pecho;
Y el deseo, de brazo de la fiebre,
Cual rico cazador recorre el soto.
     ¡Me espanta la ciudad! ¡Toda está llena
De copas por vaciar, o huecas copas!
¡Tengo miedo ¡ay de mí! de que este vino
Tósigo sea, y en mis venas luego
Cual duende vengador los dientes clave!
¡Tengo sed,—mas de un vino que en la tierra
No se sabe beber! ¡No he padecido
Bastante aún, para romper el muro
Que me aparta ¡oh dolor! de mi viñedo!
¡Tomad vosotros, catadores ruines
De vinillos humanos, esos vasos
Donde el jugo de lirio a grandes sorbos
Sin compasión y sin temor se bebe!
Tomad! Yo soy honrado, y tengo miedo!"
Flying Down the Five,"after Gala Mukomolova’s “On the Brighton Beach Boardwalk”
Families roll on toward summer, its feral freedom, ocean waves 
beckon every sibling like schools of skipjack leaping together to  
catch the sun on their silver scales. Bundles of beach umbrellas  
waiting to be raised high & planted for their temporary kingdoms.  
Trucks bobbing with oranges, station wagons bouncing with  
babies in the back. Lovers fight in the red gleam of a rover or  
swerve in the sweat of a frolick behind the wheel. A highway  
stretch of to & fro, bodies raucous & guzzling. So many dreams  
leaking from gas tanks, the oil drip of wasted want. A congested  
uproar of miles in waiting. So many exits missed.  What-could-
have-beens, just beyond the turnpike. Dead ends. Concrete &
unmoving.  
My aunt, a tree cutting herself down & me with, turns to me from  
the front seat, says, some of us didn’t get the looks in the family, right?
You know how it is. My silence hits the lane markers, all we hear is  
bumpbumpbump. All I hear is my tías telling each other, you are  
beautiful, mija, but wear a hat so you don’t get too dark. All I hear is a  
world saying brownbrownbrown a little too much & I am furiously  
stuffing my mouth with plantain chips crunching centuries  
between my teeth, my lungs a bouquet catching a windfall of  
particles unseen. So much ugly 
I tug on my seatbelt to breathe a little easier, flicking all the dead  
ends off me. A cement barrier, the road of my throat. No one says  
anything, the words filling the car like murky green lake water after  
a tumble off the road. I imagine the doors stuck in the pressure of  
the plunge, my drowned body floating to the surface not pretty  
enough to salvage & burn. I spread to the shoals, a seasoned meal  
in undertow, delicious, at least, to the fish. I am the fish, feral &  
flying.  
But I am flopped against the window, a pane dusty with estival  
judgment. I roll it down, gills gasping for air, my face a drum of  
highway breath, the 65 mph hot wind on my cheek reminding me  
I am a body on an irreplaceable planet. Don’t take everything so  
seriously, I hear. Roll the window up, dear, it really is too loud. "

"Nó, Actually, Soy Salvadoreño","“EL Sal-va-doh-RE-AN Salva-doh-RAN, Salva-DOH-RÍ-an,”
los mui-muis, we don’t even know what
to call ourselves. How to eat
a pupusa: ¿fork & knife? or
¿open it up & treat it like a taco? but
then, we’re betraying our nationalistic (read:
anti-black, anti-indigenous) impulse
to not mix with anyone else. ¿& what’s
with jalapeños in the curtido,
cipotes? ¿With using spicy “salsa”
instead of salsa de tomate? There’s too many
“restaurantes,” one side of the menu: Mexican,
the other, platos típicos. Typically
I want to order the ensalada, but then
they bring me an actual salad.
I say: cóman miercoles, they
want to charge me extra for harina de arroz. Extra
por los nueagados. There’s
nowhere I’d rather be most
than in Abuelita’s kitchen, watching her
throw bay leaves, tomatoes, garlic, orégano
into the blender, then chicharrón,
helping her sell to everyone that knows
she made the best pupusas
from 1985 to 2004. By then,
Salvadoreños became “Hermanos Lejanos,”
we traded Colón for Washingtón. By then,
Los Hermanos Flores looked for new singers
every time they returned from Los Yunaited
to San Salvador. Stay, no se vayan,
es-tei, no sean dundos, was all
those Salvadoreños could say.
We didn’t listen & came here
only to be called Mexican or Puerto Rican,
depending on the coast. We had to fight
for our better horchata, not
the lazy whiter one with only rice. & when
we didn’t want to fight
we tried to blend, speak more “Mexican,”
more ira, more popote, more
no pos guao. ¡Nó, majes!
¡No se me hagan dundos,
ponganse trucha vos!
When anyone wants to call you: Mexican.
You can just say: Nó,
actually, andáte a la M—
racista cara de nacionalista."
Dysphoria,"It’s true that I’m im-
patient under affliction. So?
Most of what the dead can
do is difficult to carry. As for
gender I can’t explain it
any more than a poem: there
was an instinct, I followed
it. A song. A bell. I saw
deer tracks in the snow. Little
split hearts beckoned me
across the lawn. My body
bucked me, fond of me.
Here is how you bear this flourish.
Bud, I’m buckling to blossoms now."
Nuestra Señora de las Iguanas,"(after Graciela Iturbide’s 1979 photograph)
My warm morning skin bristles
in the jungle hut’s frigid shower
as shrill chirps trill
off my inner ear’s high-hat.
What tropical bird lurks
outside this screen-less window?
I imagine lime green wings,
a feathered turquoise face,
but when its squeak rattles
into a hiss that creeps
behind me like a shadow, I turn
to stare straight into the onyx
eye of an iguana, iridescent
crown gleaming down
on my miserable wet head, tail
coiling the shower pole, tongue reach-
ing for my splashed shoulder.
I slink back, leave dirt in the bends
of elbows and knees, relinquish
a chance to feel eyes licked
into the back of my head. I am not
la Nuestra Señora de las Iguanas
donning her Zapotec headdress
of protruding limbs about to leap,
folded faces, triple chins. Not
Iturbide’s pebble squint refusing to blink
as it latches onto the queen of Juchitán
so far away, yet so near to where I stand
dripping on this poured concrete floor."
When I Became La Promesa,"For every unexpected illness that required medical insurance,
every second-trimester miscarriage, every chaos unemployment
caused, every looming eviction, every arrest warrant gone
unanswered, the women in my family made promesas to plaster
cast statues worshipped in overcrowded apartments with rum
poured over linoleum, nine-day candles coughing black soot
until the wick surrendered, Florida water perfuming doorways
and the backs of necks.
Promesas: barters/contracts with a God they didn’t vow to
change for but always appeased/ bowls of fruit/ paper bags filled
with coconut candy and caserolas de ajiaco/ left at busy intersections,
an oak tree in High bridge park, the doorway of the 34th precinct,
and when mar pacifico and rompe saraguey refused to grow on
Washington Heights windowsills, the youngest became part of
the trade.
Unsullied and unaware: cousin Mari pissed about having to dress
in green and red for twenty-one days to keep Tío Pablo out of jail/
Luisito scratching at an anklet made of braided corn silk to help
Tía Lorna find a new job/ and my hair not to be cut until Papi’s
tumor was removed.
Gathered in tight buns or sectioned pigtails, falling long past my
waist when asymmetrical bobs were in fashion, unaware my crown
had the necessary coercion to dislodge a mass from a colon, I grabbed
my older brother’s clippers, ran thirsty blades across my right temple
to the back of my ear, massaged the softness that emerged as strands
surrendered on bathroom tiles. My desire to mimic freestyle icons,
whose albums my cousins and I scratched on old record players,
wagered against Papi’s large intestine.
My unsteady hand: a fist
in the face of God."
California,"I used to dream of living here. I hike
a trail I know that at the end opens
to glorious views of the city I did
live in once, when men my age kept dying
while I learned how to diagnose AIDS.
Some dreams don’t come true, and some dreams become
nightmares. Across a field that smells of sage,
a few horses loiter. I want to think
that they forgive me, since they’re noble creatures.
They stamp and snort, reminding me they know
nothing of forgiveness. I used to dream
that someday I’d escape to San Francisco,
when I was still in high school and I knew.
Tall and muscled, the horses are like the jocks
on the football team who beat me once, as if pain
teaches truth and they knew I had to learn.
I used to dream I was as white as them,
that I could slam my locker closed and not
think of jail. Some nightmares come true,
like when my uncle got arrested for
cocaine. My family never talked about it,
which made me realize they could also feel shame.
That’s when I started dreaming I could be
a doctor someday, that I could get away,
prescribe myself a new life. Right now, as
the city comes into view, I think of those
animals and hope they got what they deserved.
The city stretches out its arms, its two bridges
to Oakland, to Stockton, to San Rafael,
to Vallejo; places I could have been from
but wasn’t. It looks just as it did
all those years ago. Yet I know it’s changed
because so many of us died, like Rico,
who took me up here for the first time.
We kicked a soccer ball around and smoked
a joint. I think we talked about our dreams,
but who can remember dreams. I look out
and the sun like your hand on my face
is warm, and for a moment I think this is
glorious, this is what forgiveness feels like."
"Birds in Flight, 1965","translated by Bernard Capinpin
Not as a multitude, but as one. Caught in the rush of an instant only to be contained
In an illusion of light once depicted in a holographic existence
And to give weight to the meaning of lightness. Here, he pointed
To the directions of his imprisonment. How the wings
Have too much dulled and to take wing must orchestrate
The shattering of mirrors: fragile, fine, acicular. The yellowing
Brightness is in the proximity to the light, like how one recognizes beneath
The lightbulb the chick nesting within an egg, as to trace how thick
Illusions go in the labyrinth of plurality. Now, no matter what,
They seem a bouquet of bougainvillea on the palms, dreaming to be set free.
This may be true of desire. One first keeps to heart
The simplest things one loved in childhood: the chase after
A kite broken loose, not minding the prickling thorns,
The mimosa’s curtsey to the sole. That is what freedom simply is.
Not playing patintero with shadows. Not captive to the multiplicity
Of false geometry. Almost brittle but original.
  BIRDS IN FLIGHT, 1965
Hindi marami, kundi iisa. Dinakip sa bilis ng mga iglap upang mapiit
Sa ilusyon ng liwanag nang maitanghal sa holograpikong pag-iral
At makapagbigay bigat sa kahulugan ng gaan. Dito, ganap niyang
Naituturo ang mga direksyon ng kanyang pagkakakulong. Lubos
Ang pagkakapurol ng mga pakpak at ang pagaspas ay orkestradong
Pagkabasag ng mga salamin: manipis, pino, linyado. Nasa lapit ng ilaw
Ang tingkad ng paninilaw, katulad kung papaano kinikikilala sa ilalim
Ng bombilya ang nanahang sisiw sa itlog, upang mabakas ang kapal
Ng pamamalikmata sa laberinto ng pluralidad. Ngayon, kahit papaano,
Tila pumpon ito ng mga bunggambilya sa palad, nangangarap makaalpas.
Na maaring totoo ito ukol sa pagnanasa. Unang isinilid sa dibdib
Ang mga simpleng bagay na minahal noong kabataan: ang paghabol
Sa napatid na guryon, ang hindi pag-alintana sa kalabit ng mga tinik,
Ang pagyukod ng makahiya sa talampakan. Ganoon lamang ang kalayaan.
Hindi nakikipagpatintero sa mga anino. Hindi nakapiit sa multiplisidad
Ng mga huwad na hubog. Halos babasagin ngunit orihinal."
This Body,"This Body
SKIN: NOUN
1. Sensitive. Dry
See Dove soap, Oil of Olay, shea butter.
See middle school pimples plumping up 
the night before picture day.
Always on the chin or nose.
2. Dark. See Slave. See Negro.
See age 7. See yourself
playing on the playground
when a white girl says,
you must eat a lot of chocolate
since your skin so brown.
HAIR: NOUN
1. See assimilation.
See smoke from the hot comb crocheting the air,
burning a sacred incense.
See your momma parting your hair, brining iron to nap,
“Hold your ear baby,” she tells you.
So she can press Africa out.
When Black girls ask, “Is it real?” Say yes.
When white girls ask, “Can I touch it?” Say no.
2. See natural. Reference Angela Davis,
Dorothy Pitman Hughes.
Comb yours out. Twist yours like black licorice,
like the lynching rope
used on your ancestors’ necks.
Let it hang
free.
HIPS: NOUN
1. Reference Lucille Clifton and every other big girl
who knows how to work a Hula-Hoop.
See Beyoncé. Dance like her in the mirror.
Do not be afraid of all your powers.
2. You will not fit in
most places. Do not
bend, squeeze, contort yourself.
Be big, brown girl.
Big wide smile.
Big wild hair.
Big wondrous hips.
Brown girl, be."
A Psalm for Emmett Till,"The brutal abduction and murder of 14-year-old
African American Emmett Till 
in Mississippi on August 28, 1955, 
galvanized the emerging Civil Rights Movement.
Martin Luther King, Jr. called his murder 
“one of the most brutal and inhumane crimes 
of the 20th century.”  –Biography
But what I don’t know is your favorite color, or
your favorite bubble gum flavor. I don’t know if
you liked winter days, if you ever left the imprint of
your body in the snow to make an angel. And I want
to know the song that you couldn’t stop listening to,
singing it in your head, over and over. What was the
song? I want to know the games you liked to play, if
you ever climbed a tree, swam in a lake, looked up
at the night sky and made a wish. And I want to
know who you thought you might become. Your
mother told us you were good at science, that you
loved art. I wonder if you had lived, would your
masterpieces be in a gallery or maybe you would
have kept them to yourself—hidden treasures in a
notebook, or maybe you would have been an art
teacher. Or maybe you would have been a baseball
player. I am told you were good at that, too. So
many talents, raw and pliable. There is a tale told of
you baking a cake for your mother and you were
young and boy and not good at baking, but still, you
loved your mother, so you tried. The cake did not
taste good at all, and that became a family joke. Had
you lived, you might have gotten better at baking.
And maybe you would have become a renowned
pastry chef and every time you’d be interviewed,
you’d tell the story of the horrible cake and you’d
look back at how far you’d come, at how much
you’d grown. Maybe. These are things I do not
know. But I do know you were not just a Chicago
boy meeting Mississippi, not just a whistling boy, a
kidnapped boy, a brutalized boy, a bloated boy with
a ring on his finger, not just a boy in an open casket,
not just a buried boy, a gone boy. You were a boy
with a favorite dessert, a favorite place to play, a
favorite joke to tell. You were a boy with a favorite
song—a song that you couldn’t stop listening to,
couldn’t stop singing it in your head, over and over.
What was the song? Had you kept living, maybe
you would sing us that song, teaching us the
original version. By now the song would be
remixed, new verses added, but still the same.
And the record keeps spinning, scratched and stuck
on the chorus. So many verses etched in the vinyl.
So many unfinished songs.
Your name, the refrain: Emmett Till. Medgar Evers,
Martin Luther King, Jr., Henry Dumas, Fred
Hampton, Mulugeta Seraw, Amadou Diallo, Sean
Bell, Aiyana Jones, Oscar Grant, Trayvon Martin,
Jordan Davis, Renisha McBride, Michael Brown,
Eric Garner, Michelle Cusseaux, Akai Gurley,
Tanisha Anderson, Tamir Rice, Tanisha Fonville,
Ezell Ford, Walter Scott, Freddie Gray, Sandra
Bland, Alton Sterling, Philando Castile, Stephon
Clark, Botham Jean, Aura Rosser, Atatiana
Jefferson, Ahmaud Arbery, Breonna Taylor, George
Floyd, Rayshard Brooks
and this is to say, since you were taken away from
us, so much has changed and everything is the
same. But always, your name is spoken. Like a holy
chant, a rally cry, a prayer. We cannot, will not
forget you. You are the song stuck in our hearts.
And the record keeps spinning, spinning."
Black Girls Rising,"Our Black bodies, sacred.
Our Black bodies, holy.
Our bodies, our own.
Every smile a protest.
Every laugh a miracle.
Piece by piece we stitch ourselves back together.
This Black girl body
that gets dragged out of school desk, slammed onto floor,
tossed about at pool side, pulled over and pushed onto grass,
arrested, never to return home,
shot on doorsteps, on sofas while sleeping 
and dreaming of our next day.
Our bodies, a quilt that tells the story of the middle passage.
Of roots yanked and replanted.
Our bodies, a mosaic of languages forgotten,
of freedom songs and moaned prayers.
Our bodies no longer
disregarded, objectified, scrutinized.
Our bodies, our own.
Every smile a protest.
Every laugh a miracle.
Our bodies rising. 
Our feet marching, legs dancing, our bellies birthing, hands raising, 
our hearts healing, voices speaking up.
Our bodies.
So Black, so beautiful.
Here, still.
Rising, rising."
This Body II,"My body is
perfect and
imperfect and
Black and
girl and
big and
thick hair and
short legs and
scraped knee and
healed scar and
heart beating and
hands that hold and
voice that bellows and
feet that dance and
arms that embrace and
my momma’s eyes and
my daddy’s smile and
my grandma’s hope and
my body is masterpiece and
my body is mine."

Pledge Allegiance,"I tap-tap-tap the window, while my mother smiles and mouths,
Tranquila. I tap-tap the glass, my mother a fish I’m trying to summon.
I tap until a border agent says: Stop. Until a border agent
shows me the gun on her belt. My childhood was caught
on video border agents deleted every three months.
I thought myself a movie star blowing kisses at the children
selling chiclets on the bridge. My cruelty from the backseat window
caught on video—proof I am an American. The drug sniffing
dogs snap their teeth at my mother detained for her thick accent,
a warp in her green card. My mother who mouths, Tranquila.
My mother’s fingers dark towers on a screen for the Bioten scan.
Isn’t it fun? says the border agent. The state takes a picture
of my mother’s left ear. Isn’t it fun? I tap-tap-tap the glass
and imagine it shatters into shiny marbles. A marble like the one
I have in my pocket, the one I squeeze so hard I hope to reach
its blue swirls. Blue swirls I wish were water I could bring to my mother
in a glass to be near her. Friends, Americans, countrymen lend me your ears!
But only the border agent replies, Do you know the pledge of allegiance?
She points to a flag pinned on a wall. I do, so I stand and pledge to the country
that says it loves me so much, it loves me so much it wants to take
my mother far away from me. Far away, to the place they keep
all the other mothers to sleep on rubber mats and drink from rubber hoses.
Don’t worry, says the border agent, we will take good care of your mommy.
My mother mouths, Tranquila. Her teeth, two rows of gold I could pawn
for something shiny, something shiny like the border agent’s gun.
Friends, Americans, countrymen lend me your ears, so I can hear
my mother through bulletproof glass, so I can hear her over the roar
of American cars crossing this dead river by the wave of an agent’s pale hand."
Like an Auto-Tune of Authentic Love,"I’m watching an old movie in one corner
of my laptop and in another the shadows
nesting in your neck, the flickering frequencies
of your sweater, and remember the Jack Nicholson
tagline in that movie we almost watched then decided
against fearing the little taser of misogyny:
You make me want to be a better person. Sometimes
the only thing I want is to say marry me
even though we both think marriage is archaic and weird
or at least for us. It’s not marry me I want to say
but rather weld with me like a net we also sit in.
Oh FaceTime face and shadow neck and the almost synced
sound of our shared watching. You have a list of things
that are going to be the death of you,
and so do I, which we cover in our debriefings.
All of this is to say that distance makes my heart go farther
into the terrain of heartfelt and I love it: how ordinarily
classifiable it is like feeling literal figurative butterflies
in your stomach. The good being fundamental.
Surprising love can happen at any part of one’s life
like the pixels deciding when to flicker into bursts."
Isabell*,"Like any love should be,
hers was touch and never leave.
Some arguments and tears with Antoney,
her husband, but no freedom.
They were tied, a curt blessing
in that era of dark skin and kin.
Separations would occur soon enough,
but they had to band together,
this woman and her man who might
have come on a ship with eighteen others.
Isabell cooked for him from flesh
he trapped or caught.
They might have looked at the entrails
of his prey to decipher
what the day had been,
back home in Africa.
What would the drums say?
Was it a feast time?
Was their village in the same spot?
When their son was born, Isabell
probably kept him away
from others for several days.
That night, when the necessary
seclusion was done, Antoney
would have shaved the baby’s
head and spat in his ear.
Tapped a foot on the floor,
told an unforgotten story.
And then, Isabell put the baby
to her breast and sang,
Your name is William here,
but Mother calls you
something else,
something old in secret.
  *The first recorded intact African family in seventeenth-century Virginia were three enslaved servants of one Captain William Tucker: Antoney, Isabell, and “William theire Child Baptised.”"
Blues: Odysseus,"How many sat underwater,
entangled by myth’s past tense,
before Neptune first raised his
beard in the direction of Ethiopia,
and after, Odysseus—
always living—
was saved by Homer’s tablet?
Centuries after that story was written,
in the land of Not Make Believe,
a crew of slave-ship sailors
threw one hundred and thirty-two
Africans into the Atlantic Ocean.
Heave-ho to souls.
And people. And laws. And kin.
But Odysseus lives. He always will,
Our Great White Hope—
before whiteness was invented—
this hero who longs for the wood’s sway.
Despite his tendency to chase tail—
sirens and sundry other
poppycock-drinking girls—
I want to be happy that Homer imagined
a sea housing pretty, forgiving Nymphs—
while somewhere else, a wheel dances
and someone else drowns.
Sharks should pass Odysseus by,
never imagining his taste.
The gods shouldn’t pull at his fate—
now angry, now benevolent.
I try hard not to blame that man:
We all deserve our Maker’s love."
The Transatlantic Progress of Sugar in the Eighteenth Century,"I own I am shock’d at the purchase of slaves,
And fear those who buy them and sell them are knaves...
I pity them greatly, but I must be mum,
For how could we do without sugar and rum?
— William Cowper, from “Pity for Poor Africans”

"Lost Letter #1: Phillis Wheatley, Boston, to Susannah Wheatley, Boston*","January 18, 1764
Dear Mistress:
Odysseus sailed the ocean like me
and Nymphs held him in their arms.
They are ladies like my yaay.
[i will burn this letter in the hearth you are
watching me as i smile i am a good girl i am]
I shall practice my lessons for you
and Miss Mary, pretend Master Nathaniel
does not yank my hair and tell me,
he’ll take a razor and shave me bald.
For you, God will scrub my skin—
but when might I see my yaay? I cannot
recall how she would say bird or baby
or potato in that other place.
Yaay needs to see that my teeth grew in,
that I am alive after my long journey.
[yaay come for me please i shall be a good
girl i have forgotten how to be naughty]
Today snow comes down. Outside,
a soul has slipped and fallen on the ice.
That’s what that crying means.
Your servant and child,
Phillis
  * The word yaay here means “mother” in the Wolof language of Senegal and The Gambia of West Africa."
The Mechanical Cotton Picker,"for Black Chicago poets
It wasn’t that they killed John Boy
          in front of his mama’s small blue house,
and that no one called her Ms. Bluebird anymore
out of respect, though she never minded the name,
it made her believe she’d fly off some day,  
or that the sheriff let John Boy’s body sit
until even the babies stopped crying,
their eyes filled with him,
his body already going to marble
no one would be able to lift from their sleep.
It was that we could feed ourselves then
by getting down on our hands and knees to pick cotton,
and most knew what a body smelled like
blowing down a dirt road.
When Chicago reached my ear the war was full of bodies.
They sent whole train cars for us black folk.
I read the Defender and waited to hide my face
behind the curtains of a northbound train
and I prayed the train car would fly.
The south truly doesn’t want us to go.
A Mississippi cop would catch a family disappearing
behind a rainstorm and send them home,
the clouds leaving four muddy fields at a time.
I left like a season’s first lover across a window,
slowly like a southern sun
diagonal on a work-back.
I wanted to carry my aunts to Chicago with me
like this obituary-filled Bible,
these plums I got saved, purpling in my bag."
The Motorcycle Queen,"for Bessie Stringfield
You said you took God with you to all 48 states.
You caroled your grief on an Indian Scout,
  rode your Harley until the crowd forgot it was a motorcycle,
saw a stallion riding the track wall,
breaking for a field’s freedom.
  You wanted a story you could tell
about surviving America on two wheels,
  six years too early for the Green Book.
But I understand leaving.
I’ve been looking
                            to see the world."
The Teller of Tales,"translated by Ursula K. Le Guin
    When I’m walking, everything
on earth gets up
and stops me and whispers to me,
and what they tell me is their story.
    And the people walking
on the road leave me their stories,
I pick them up where they fell
in cocoons of silken thread.
    Stories run through my body
or sit purring in my lap.
So many they take my breath away,
buzzing, boiling, humming.
Uncalled they come to me,
and told, they still won’t leave me.
    The ones that come down through the trees
weave and unweave themselves,
and knit me up and wind me round
until the sea drives them away.
    But the sea that’s always telling stories,
the wearier I am the more it tells me...
    The people who cut trees,
the people who break stones,
want stories before they go to sleep.
    Women looking for children
who got lost and don’t come home,
women who think they’re alive
and don’t know they’re dead,
every night they ask for stories,
and I return tale for tale.
    In the middle of the road, I stand
between rivers that won’t let me go,
and the circle keeps closing
and I’m caught in the wheel.
    The riverside people tell me
of the drowned woman sunk in grasses
and her gaze tells her story,
and I graft the tales into my open hands.
    To the thumb come stories of animals,
to the index fingers, stories of my dead.
There are so many tales of children
they swarm on my palms like ants.
    When my arms held
the one I had, the stories
all ran as a blood-gift
in my arms, all through the night.
Now, turned to the East,
I’m giving them away because I forget them.
    Old folks want them to be lies.
Children want them to be true.
All of them want to hear my own story,
which, on my living tongue, is dead.
    I’m seeking someone who remembers it
leaf by leaf, thread by thread.
I lend her my breath, I give her my legs,
so that hearing it may waken it for me.
  La Contadora 
    Cuando camino se levantan
todas las cosas de la tierra
y me paran y cuchichean
y es su historia lo que cuentan.
    Y las gentes que caminan
en la ruta me la dejan
y la recojo caída
en capullos que son de huella.
    Historias corren mi cuerpo
o en mi regazo ronronean.
Tantas son que no dan respiro,
zumban, hierven y abejean.
Sin llamada se me vienen
y contadas tampoco dejan…
    Las que bajan por los árboles
se trenzan y se destrenzan,
y me tejen y me envuelvan
hasta que el mar los ahuyenta.
    Pero el mar que cuenta siempre
más rendida, más me deja...
    Los que están mascando bosque
y los que rompen la piedra,
al dormirse quieren historias.
    Mujeres que buscan hijos
perdidos que no regresan,
y las que se creen vivas
y no saben que están muertas,
cada noche piden historias,
y yo me rindo cuenta que cuenta.
    A medio camino quedo
entre ríos que no me sueltan,
el corro se va cerrando
y me atrapa en la rueda.
   Los ribereños me cuentan
la ahogada sumida en hierbas,
y su mirada cuenta su historia,
y yo las tronco en mis palmas abiertas.
    Al pulgar llegan las de animales,
al índice las de mis muertos.
Las de niños, de ser tantas
en las palmas me hormiguean.
    Cuando tomaba así mis brazos
el que yo tuve, todas ellas
en regalo de sangre corrieron
mis brazos una noche entera.
Ahora yo, vuelta al Oriente,
se las voy dando porque no recuerdo.
    Los viejos las quieren mentidas,
los niños las quieren ciertas.
Todos quieren oír la historia mía
que en mi lengua viva está muerta.
    Busco alguna que la recuerde
hoja por hoja, herbra por hebra.
Le presto mi aliento, le doy mi marcha
por si el oírla me la despierta."
In Praise of Dreams,"after Wisława Szymborska
In my dreams,
I lasso a wild steer on the first try.
I chauffeur Picasso
To meet up with Dali—
None of us is happy about this summit.
After licking my fingertips,
I play guitar masterfully.
I use index cards to make sense
Of the universe.
I discover my childhood cat in the neighbor’s tree—
So that’s where you’ve been, you little rascal.
I beg the alligator, por favor,
To make a snap judgement,
Will it be my leg or my arm?
Picture me swimming with dolphins.
Picture me with these dolphins
Sitting in lawn chairs.
I’m full of gratitude—
The lightbulb comes on
When the refrigerator door is opened.
Yes, I’m the scientist who solved laryngitis—
Now all of us howl at our own pleasure.
I get to throw a trophy from a moving car.
When I park my car,
I’m awarded another trophy—
Someone above is giving me a second chance."
To: All Poets From: Northeastern North Carolina,"It’s just getting hot,
    dogwoods showering our shoulders with flowers.
I saw dead baby birds on a trail
   so I know new life has arrived
lost in the survival of pine and ash. I’ll say it plainly—
we need you down here.
Yesterday, my uncle put a nail through his thumb
working for the same white man he’s worked for since sixth grade.
Last night his blood fell on the bathroom floor and made a star
he couldn’t follow.
He needs to hear your poems."
I Wanted to Place an Ocean,"I tell my uncle’s ghost
don’t waste your time haunting white folks who owe you money,
I try to give him my body, but he won’t take it,
                                                and pulls his wagon on.
I began in fields near pines where we laughed and fried fish.
                               If someone were to sing,
it would grow through each ghost
                               and be heard as geese crossing overhead.
The dead know
                     the work they have done,
  and if they are not careful their hands
will stay in the shape of that work.
  My hands haven’t touched cotton or tobacco,
I haven’t pulled small green worms
  or carried them inside with me hidden in the body’s doublings.
  I only was a child in harvested fields,
when my people let the cotton sleep there were no vacations,
the fields of Rolesville belong to my kinfolk, dead and alive
and I don’t know if my great-grandparents ever saw the ocean
                                                   or fell asleep on the beach."
Miss Mary Mack Introduces Her Wings,"My name is    Miss Mary    Mack        Mack        Mack
          you sing it      my name
  I turned into a bluebird last summer, I flew 
  through all the South. My wings are blue 
and I touch the sky. 
  At first, I decided I was never coming back.
  I took off my black
                               housedress. I knew freedom 
  was not the act of flying, 
                      but the steady beat of wings. 
  It was my steady black,
                        blue and my blues were gone,
  I wanted to be 
                        a bird and became."
"The Kitchen, Indexed","A glass knife. A candle. Chamomile.
A handsaw. A hand towel.
A sharps container. Stones
that may or may not be hollow,
holding crystals. Ceramic tributes
to the moon. A no-kill mousetrap.
Carnations. Carnal studies. Blue thread,
to make stitches. Matches, to be struck.
I wanted to understand form,
the beginning of things. I deconstructed.
I stopped a clock, pulled its hands
from its hard face. I undressed
beneath the incandescent overhead.
I couldn’t name myself, but I renamed myself.
In a bowl, strawberries thawed
in their own wet red. I couldn’t think
too hard, which worried me. Because
there was no answer I wanted. To be a man
to be a tree / or something less / like a plank. 
What I saw, I pinned down. I listed
what I knew to be true. Road salt
in an open dish. An hourglass full
of pink sand. A ruler. Assuming what I saw
was honest. The name? It means watchful
(later I found, in Latin, wrath. Oops).
It is my duty, dear reader, to never look away."
The Lyric Theatre: Lyceum of Dreams,"On the occasion of the reopening of the Lyric Theatre, 1940s Black dream house, Lexington, Kentucky
On the East End, we shine our
own shoes, dress our own legs,
smooth down willful hair, let all
new trouble float. Done-up.
We promenade and pass, Deweese
(DoAsYouPlease) & 3rd, where
Winkfield & Murphy once hoofed
& flew backwards, black-winged,
on horseback. Under the blazing
marquee we hand our shiny quarter
over, glide toward, then across,
our eight-point star, rose-tile light
of regeneration. In the dark theater,
the salt-cod sweat of work, now left
behind, names hurled our way all day,
now set aside, paychecks that never
match our labor folded away now.
House lights dim: Paul Robeson is
Othello. Miss Ella strikes & swings.
The Duke & Count jazz-juice the night,
royalty speaks to royalty. The Ink Spots
spill all with Sarah Vaughan, Miss Mahalia
orchestrates & moans and moonbeams,
Candy Johnson & his Peppermint Sticks
fill every inch of stage. Marian Anderson
poses her hands in alto-soprano.
Woody Strode, our Black cowboy,
wild-rides the open oat fields & range.
Our dusty eyes drink in Beah Richards,
Dorothy Dandridge, Lena Horne.
Intermission at the Lyric: Lights up!
Freda Jones tries on a brand-new
hat and no one is arrested. Bernard
Lewis licks his ice cream cone on every
melting side, no one is booked for
licking or loitering. Morgan and
Marvin Smith, the famous picture-
taking twins, take our picture too.
At the Lyric we pose, bright futures
we portray. At the Lyric we fall in love
with our lips: Lucinda kisses Big Tank
clear through the opening act. Julia
can’t see the show for looking at the
ocean of their mouths; open, close.
We cry at the Lyric, laugh out loud at
the Lyric. Whisper Quiet! Here comes
the principal! Miss Lucy Harth Smith
proudly takes her seat. At the Lyric,
William Wells Brown pulls out his
indelible pen to write us down. Isaac
Scott Hathaway shapes our faces in
a mustard-amber clay on new money.
We come to the Lyric to rise, rejuvenate,
see ourselves win, watch ourselves lifted
up in lights, hit the home run, be hero
champion of the world. Only to file
back out live & alive, stroll back across
the rays of the eight-point star, rose-tile
light of return, sink back into the race-
track of the East End with everything
we have now become. Sweet Lyric,
lyceum of dreams, where once we came
to rise into who Mama, not dime-store
magazines, promised us we were."
Anniversary,"Outside, an abandoned mattress sags with rain
and the driveway turns all sludge when I remember
I could’ve died eight years ago, in a bed
smaller than the one I share with a new lover
who just this morning found another grey hair in my afro,
and before resettling the wiry curl with the others,
kissed the freckle on my forehead.
I admit, I don’t know a love that doesn’t
destroy. Last night while we slept,
a mouse drowned in the rice pot
I left soaking in the sink. I tried
to make a metaphor out of this, the way
he took the mouse to the edge of the lake in the yard,
released it to a deeper grave. It was
an anniversary, just my lover
taking a dead thing away, taking it
somewhere I couldn’t see."

Black Parade,"Coming out isn’t the same as coming to America

except for the welcome parade

put on by ghosts like your granduncle Roy

who came to New York from Panamá in the 50s

and was never heard of again

and by the beautiful gays who died of AIDS in the 80s

whose cases your mother studied

in nursing school. She sent you to the US to become

an “American” and you worry

she’ll blame this country

for making you a “marica,”

a “Mary,” like it might have made your uncle Roy.

The words “America” and “marica” are so similar!

Exchange a few vowels

and turn anyone born in this country

queer. I used to watch Queer as Folk as a kid

and dream of sashaying away

the names bullies called me in high school

for being Black but not black enough, or the kind of black they saw on TV:

black-ish, negro claro, cueco.

It was a predominately white school,

the kind of white the Spanish brought to this continent

when they cozened my ancestors from Africa.

There was no welcome parade for my ancestors back then

so, they made their own procession, called it “carnaval”

and fully loaded the streets with egungun costumes,

holy batá drum rhythms, shouting and screaming in tongues,

and booty dancing in the spirit.

I don’t want to disappear in New York City,

lost in a drag of straightness.

So instead, I proceed

to introduce my mother to my first boyfriend

after I’ve moved her to Texas

and helped make her a citizen.

Living is trafficking through ghosts in a constant march

toward a better life, welcoming the next in line.

Thriving is wining the perreo to soca on the

Noah’s Arc pride parade float, like you’re

the femme bottom in an early aughts gay TV show.

Surviving is (cross-)dressing as an American marica,

until you’re a ‘merica or a ‘murica

and your ancestors see

you’re the king-queen of Mardi Gras,

purple scepter, crown, and krewe."
So They Say— They Finally Nailed— the Proton’s Size— & Hope— Dies—,"but love does not, Menelle Sebastien.
Of all the afflictions
& luck,
all the sums & paradoxes,
& gravitons that add up
to more minus
than plus,
I promise that love
is often as inconsiderate as it is just
because actual love,
I imagine,
is a wave function
that isn’t restricted
to being
in any one place
at one time.
No, love must
be a superposition
with a measurement problem,
but don’t worry,
I won’t get into alternative
realities & how a single judgement
from one can so easily
dissolve
whom,
or what,
she’s sizing up—                & yet,
                              when experts speak of capturing
vastness at such a small scale,
I can only see the passenger
pigeon
flitting into living
sequoia trees,
& every blue whale
sinking into the great
barrier
reef
& all the threats each are facing,
all these gigantic things
that beat
within the size
of a subatomic being
that is the proton,
which is not fundamental
as love
ought to be—
                            & maybe it does all
add up
to a single hush.
Like how we try to escape
what makes us human by trying
to make sense of what made us
human.
These days,
when I think on the proton,
I only observe love
as entanglement
in which we bias & sway & touch
over great,
great
distances.
But like I said,
I won’t get into it
like the quark’s fate
& all the possible quantum trickery
out there,
lying in wait.
I don’t believe hope dies
just because old measurements got it
wrong & there are no secret lives
between protons & muons
that cause the former to change
in size,
silencing all the music
that drives us
toward mystery
rather than discovery.
Maybe just thank
electronic hydrogen,
since, for now, there’s an answer,
even if it feels like a dead end—
                                                       because I’d bet everything,
                                                       that at least something began
                                                       over this:                         jounce,
                                                       butterfly & cower ::

                                                       & sour—
                 until aching
                 each other’s spoils,
                 stripping bare
                 their delicate
                 & deadly
                 creaking
                 coils—"
Battlegrounds,"Gettysburg National Military Park
Motorcycles and white tour vans speed 
between behemoth granite shafts, shove
my body by their force, leave me roadside
and wandering fields. Little is funny
when you’re Chicana and walking 
a Civil War site not meant for walking.
Regardless, I ask park rangers and guides 
for stories on Mexicans soldiers,
receive shrugs. No evidence in statues 
or statistics. In the cemetery, not one 
Spanish name. I’m alone in the wine shop. 
It’s the same in the post office, the market, 
the antique shop with KKK books on display.
In the peach orchard, I prepare a séance,
sit cross-legged in grass, and hold
a smoky quartz to the setting sun.  
I invite the unseen to speak. So many dead, 
it’s said Confederates were left to rot. 
In war, not all bodies are returned home 
nor graves marked. I Google “Mexicans 
in the Civil War” and uncover layers 
to the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo 
and Cinco de Mayo. This is how I meet 
ancestors for the first time, heroes 
this country decorates in clownish sombreros 
and fake mustaches, dishonors for fighting 
European empire on shared American land 
Power & Money dictate can’t be shared. 
Years before this, carrying water gallons 
up an Arizona mountain ridge to replenish 
supplies in a pass known as “Dead Man’s,” 
I wrote messages on bottles to the living, 
scanned Sonoran canyons for the lost,
and knew too many would not be found. 
A black Sharpie Virgen drawn on hot plastic 
became a prayer: may the next officer halt 
before cracking her face beneath his boot,
spilling life on to dirt. No, nothing’s funny
when you’re brown in a country you’re taught 
isn’t yours, your dead don’t count."
The Five Horses of Doctor Ramón Emeterio Betances,"Mayagüez, Puerto Rico 1856
I. The First Horse
Cholera swarmed unseen through the water, lurking in wells and fountains,
squirming in garbage and excrement, infinitesimal worms drilling the intestines,
till all the water and salt would pour from the body, till the body became a worm,
shriveling and writhing, a slug in salt, till the skin burned blue as flame, the skin
of the peasant and the skin of the slave gone blue, the skin in the slave barracks blue,
the skin of ten thousand slaves blue. The Blue Death, face hidden in a bandanna,
dug graves with the gravediggers, who fell into holes they shoveled for the dead.
The doctors died too, seeing the signs in the mirror, the hand with the razor shaking.
II. The Second Horse
Doctor Betances stepped off the boat, back from Paris, the humidity of the plague
glistening in his beard. He saw the stepmother who fed him sink into a mound
of dirt, her body empty as the husk of a locust in drought.He toweled off his hands.
In the quarantine tents there was laudanum by the bitter spoonful, the lemonade
and broth; in the dim of the kerosene lamps there was the compress cool against
the forehead, the elixir of the bark from the cinchona tree. For peasants and slaves
moaning to their gods, the doctor prescribed chilled champagne to soothe the belly.
For the commander of the Spanish garrison, there was silence bitter as the spoon.
III. The Third Horse
At every hacienda, at every plantation, as the bodies of slaves rolled one by one
into ditches all hipbones and ribs, drained of water and salt, stripped of names,
Doctor Betances commanded the torch for the barracks where the bodies would
tangle together, stacked up as if they never left the ship that sailed from Africa,
kept awake by the ravenous worms of the plague feasting upon them. Watching
the blue flames blacken the wood, the doctor and the slaves saw another plague
burning away, the plague of manacles scraping the skin from hands that cut
the cane, the plague of the collar with four spikes for the runaways brought back.
IV. The Fourth Horse
The pestilence of the masters, stirred by spoons into the coffee of the world,
spread first at the marketplace, at auction, the coins passing from hand to hand.
So Doctor Betances began, at church, with twenty-five pesos in pieces of eight,
pirate coins dropped into the hands of slaves to drop into the hands of masters,
buying their own infants at the baptismal font. The secret society of abolitionists
shoved rowboats full of runaways off the docks in the bluest hour of the blue night,
off to islands without masters. Even the doctor would strangle in the executioner’s
garrote, spittle in his beard, if the soldiers on watch woke up from the opiate of empire.
V. The Fifth Horse
The governor circled his name in the name of empire, so Doctor Betances
sailed away to exile, the island drowning in his sight, but a vision stung
his eyes like salt in the wind: in the world after the plague, no more
plague of manacles; after the pestilence, no more pestilence of masters;
after the cemeteries of cholera, no more collar of spikes or executioners.
In his eye burned the blue of the rebel flag and the rising of his island.
The legend calls him the doctor who exhausted five horses, sleepless
as he chased invisible armies into the night. Listen for the horses.

Maine Yet Miami,"The soft harp of snowfall plucking through
my pine trees lulls me to peace, yet I still
hear the bongo of thunderstorms rapping
the rooftop of my queer childhood, dancing
to the clouds’ rage, raining away my sorrows.
Though snow melts silently into the gurgles
of my creek, my grandmother’s voice remains
frozen in my ears, still calling me a sissy, yet
praising me as her best friend. Even though
I marvel over spring’s abracadabra each time
my lilac blooms appear, I still disappear back
into the magic of summer nights on the porch,
the moon lighting up my grandfather’s stories
about his lost Cuba, his words carried away
with the smoke of his tabaco and the scent
of his jasmine tree flowering the night with
its tiny, perfumed stars. Despite the daystars
peeking behind the lavender clouds swaddling
mountain peaks in my window at sunset, I still
rise to the sun of my youth over the sea, after
a night’s sleep on a bed of sand, dreaming or
dreading who I would, or wouldn’t become.
Though I grew courageous enough to marry
a man who can only love me in his English:
darling, sweetheart, honey, I love him back
more in my Spanish whispered in his ears as
he sleeps: amorcito, tesoro, ceilo. After all
the meatloafs and apple pies we’ve baked
in our kitchen, I still sit down to the memory
of my mother’s table, savoring the loss of her
onion-smothered vaca frita and creamy flan.
No matter how tastefully my throw pillows
perfectly match my chic rugs and the stylish
art on my walls, it all falls apart sometimes,
just as I do, until I remember to be the boy
I was, always should be, playing alone with
his Legos in the family room, still enchanted
by the joy of his sheer self and his creations:
perfect or not, beautiful or not, immortal or
as mortal as the plentiful life I’ve made here,
although I keep living with my father dying
in our old house, his head cradled in my hand
for a sip of tea and a kiss on his forehead—
our last goodbye in the home that still lives
within this home where I live on to die, too."
A Portrait in Greys,"Will it never be possible
to separate you from your greyness?
Must you be always sinking backward
into your grey-brown landscapes—and trees
always in the distance, always against a grey sky?
                          Must I be always
moving counter to you? Is there no place
where we can be at peace together
and the motion of our drawing apart
be altogether taken up?
                                 I see myself
standing upon your shoulders touching 
a grey, broken sky—
but you, weighted down with me,
yet gripping my ankles,—move
                          laboriously on,
where it is level and undisturbed by colors."
Pegasus Autopsy,"translated by Bryan Mendoza
It’s a spacious chamber.
Well lit.
A light that refracts the distant woodland.
Over the table lies
the body and the wings
outspread
like sails of a shipwreck.
They’ve stitched together the carnage
with no other motive
than something comparable to mercy.
Soon the volunteers will arrive
and they’ll take the body,
including the wings
to the landfill.
  Disección del cadáver de Pegaso
  Es una sala espaciosa.
Muy clara.
Es luz que refracta el bosque lejano.
Sobre la mesa yacen
el cuerpo y las alas
extendidas
como velas de bajeles deshechos.
Han hilvanado el despojo
sin otro motivo
que algo semejante a la caridad.
Pronto llegarán los voluntarios
y se llevarán el cuerpo,
incluidas las alas,
al basural."
A Pile of Fish,"for Paul Otremba
Six in all, to be exact. I know it was a Tuesday 
     or Wednesday because the museum closes early
on those days. I almost wrote something 
     about the light being late—; the “late light”
is what I almost said, and you know how we 
     poets go on and on about the light and 
the wind and the dark, but that day the dark was still 
     far away swimming in the Pacific, and we had 
45 minutes to find Goya’s “Still Life with Bream” 
     before the doors closed. I’ve now forgotten 
three times the word Golden in the title of that painting
     —and I wish I could ask what you think 
that means. I see that color most often 
     these days when the cold, wet light of morning 
soaks my son’s curls and his already light 
     brown hair takes on the flash of fish fins
in moonlight. I read somewhere 
     that Goya never titled this painting, 
or the other eleven still lifes, so it’s just 
     as well because I like the Spanish title better.  
“Doradas” is simple, doesn’t point 
     out the obvious. Lately, I’ve been saying 
dorado so often in the song I sing 
     to my son, “O sol, sol, dorado sol 
no te escondes...” I felt lost 
     that day in the museum, but you knew 
where we were going having been there 
     so many times. The canvas was so small 
at 17 x 24 inches. I stood before it 
     lost in its beach of green sand and 
that silver surf cut with pink. 
     I stared while you circled the room 
like a curious cat. I took a step back, 
     and then with your hands in your pockets 
you said, No matter where we stand, 
     there’s always one fish staring at us.
As a new father, I am now that pyramid 
     of fish; my body is all eyes and eyes. 
Some of them watch for you in the west 
where the lion sun yawns and shakes off 
     its sleep before it purrs, and hungry, 
dives deep in the deep of the deep."
From Barrio Obrero to La Quince,"translated from the Spanish by Urayoán Noel
Walking is a process in ruins,
a dead history.
You inhabit the ruin and you find
a coin here and there rolling on the ground.
Men without eyes are threshing away time
in Santurce’s surviving businesses. 
It makes you want to cry
or sneak into the yards and pluck the fruits
of so many inhabitable houses 
with boarded-up windows and doors.
The city is full of homeless people.
The city is full of poor immigrants dreaming of the United States.
Perhaps leaving and coming back makes you a foreigner. 
There’s so much you don’t know about Puerto Rico now.
You begin discovering it by walking.
  De Barrio Obrero a La Quince
  Caminar es un proceso en ruinas,
historia muerta.
Habitas la ruina y encuentras
una que otra moneda rodando por el piso.
Hombres sin ojos desgranan tiempo
en los negocios que sobreviven en Santurce.
Da ganas de llorar
o de meterse al patio y arrancarle frutas
a tanta casa habitable
con las puertas y ventanas clausuradas.
La ciudad llena de personas sin hogar.
La ciudad llena de inmigrantes pobres que sueñan con Estados Unidos.
Irse y volver acaso te vuelve un extranjero.
Desconoces ahora tanto a Puerto Rico.
Caminando se empieza a descubrirlo."
Give Me This,"I thought it was the neighbor’s cat back
to clean the clock of the fledgling robins low
in their nest stuck in the dense hedge by the house
but what came was much stranger, a liquidity
moving all muscle and bristle. A groundhog
slippery and waddle thieving my tomatoes still
green in the morning’s shade. I watched her
munch and stand on her haunches taking such
pleasure in the watery bites. Why am I not allowed
delight? A stranger writes to request my thoughts
on suffering. Barbed wire pulled out of the mouth,
as if demanding that I kneel to the trap of coiled
spikes used in warfare and fencing. Instead,
I watch the groundhog closer and a sound escapes
me, a small spasm of joy I did not imagine
when I woke. She is a funny creature and earnest,
and she is doing what she can to survive."
Along the Border,"after Idra Novey
On a dirt road
On a drive to el campo
You found a batey
I cut the cane 
We sucked on a stalk
You gave me your arms 
I swam in the river
We locked the door 
Then the lights went out 
And the radio played 
You fingered the pesos 
I walked to the beach
We fried the fish 
You ate the mango  
I jumped in the water
We bought the flowers
Then the migrants came
And you bartered for more 
Then the sirens blared
And they were carried away
But we didn’t stop them 
Then the ocean swept
And the palm trees sagged
They were foreigners
We were foreigners  
And we lived there"
Hysterical Strength,"When I hear news of a hitchhiker
struck by lightning yet living,
or a child lifting a two-ton sedan
to free his father pinned underneath,
or a camper fighting off a grizzly
with her bare hands until someone,
a hunter perhaps, can shoot it dead,
my thoughts turn to black people—
the hysterical strength we must
possess to survive our very existence,
which I fear many believe is, and
treat as, itself a freak occurrence."

To the Country,"translated from the Spanish by Charles B. McMichael
Prairie land, Happy days. In Royal Buenos Ayres
Now far, far behind are left the fire, and terrific heat.
Today in thy verdant exultation all my day dreams will come to life
And I shall inhale thy fragrant breath and bathe me in thy sun.
A very good morning to thee, my orchard, and now I salute thy freshness
As it bursts forth from thy branches, while thy peach trees are in bloom;
Framed about with rose bushes thy Florida Street
Looks on while Glory, the Mart and Sport pass along.
A little bird, a poet, meditates verses in his craw;
Gossipy and petulant, a sparrow goes chattering;
The climbing plants are arguing about political affairs;
The roses and the lilies talk of art and also of love.
Driving his chariot team of fairy dragon flies,
The mischief making Puck of rich dreams passes
And here is the splendid sportswoman in her celestial car,
The Imperial Titania followed by Oberon,
At night when the half ring of gold shows itself
Beneath the tranquil blue of Heaven, the loved one of Pierrot,
(It is a pallid feast which reigns now in the orchard)
Plays upon her lyre the air, forsooth, do-re-mi-fa-sol.
The curious violets into her balcony are peeping
And one of them sighs, “Tis a pity that the nightingale is not here!”
The sylphs accompany the dances of the breezes
In a vague hazy Walpurgis of perfume and fantasy.
Soon is heard the echo of the loud cry of the pampas.
It burns like the setting of the Argentine sun
And a spectral horseman like a shadow crosses,
Over his shoulder is a poncho, upon his face is grief.
Who are you solitary traveler of the night?
“I am Poetry” who once upon a time reigned here
I am the last gaucho herdsman. I am going away forever
From our ancient country and carrying away its heart."
A Proclamation,"Our bodies give
into the ocean rolling
     us beneath its tongues     How do we sing

"Slippage, a Provocation","To call oneself African (here) means, simply, the rejection of a view of self as mired in double consciousness. It is to imagine (or know—or avow, finally) one’s consciousness as that of the African’s untainted by the European encounter.

Think back, say 180 years: The slip, slippage…of thinking as someone free (thinking one’s self free to think, to be) and the cruel knock of the master or mistress insisting that you are object, abject…that what has slipped from your unguarded thoughts is aberration and must be nullified swiftly, permanently
                    You have been made to know at all costs—short of a kind of useless dysfunction—that yours is not to think, muse, contemplate. Your mind must be tabula rasa…your will nonexistent—except what is given you by others to be or do. The sharp eye or blunt iron or cutting whip has told you so.
                               
                          And you must take pains to never forget it.

Anyone who comes back to this human realm could be considered to have been stuck between a rock and a hard place. A liminal space, it offers possibility yet is fraught with tension. It is a “chafed” position, a chastened position, perhaps—as it does not provide stability or spiritual haven, but is, rather, a way station.

on empathy,"what it sounds like is a bird breaking small bones against glass. the least of them, a sparrow, of course. you’re about to serve dinner and this is the scene. blame the bird, the impertinent windows, try not to think of the inconvenience of blood splattering violet in the dusk. how can you eat after this? do not think of whom to blame when the least of us hurdles into the next moment. a pane opening into another. the least of us spoiling your meal.
~
the smell of it will be smoke and rank. you will mutter about this for days, the injustice of splatter on your window. foolish bird. civilization. house with the view. fucking bird feeder. it will take you a week, while the flesh starts to rot under thinning feathers, while the blood has congealed and stuck, for you to realize that no one is coming to take the body. it is your dead bird. it is your glass. you have options you think. hire out. move out. leave it for the bigger blacker birds.
~
you will taste rotting just above the top of your tongue. so much, that you check yourself to make sure that it is not you. the bird deserves something. you go to the closet, pick out a shoe box. discount? designer? you start to think of how it has come to this: pondering your mortality through a bird. a dead bird. never-mind. you don’t find it a problem not running into windows.
~
it is an eyesore and we start to gather as large billows in your yard. you marvel at us, beautiful, collecting and loosening our dark bodies from white sky to your grass. and then it comes. more bones and blood. one by one crashing into the closed pane. mindless birds. brown and gray feathers. filthy pests. another. fucking feeder. we look like billions lifting into flight and then—shatter.
~
you might find a delicate humility in the art of cleaning glass. while you work, you sustain tiny slivers of opened flesh. tips of your fingers sing. shards, carnage, it has become too much. you are careful to pick up all that you can see. you call a repairman. you are careful to pick up all that you can see. you throw everything into big shiny trash bags. you are careful to pick up all that you can see. you consider french doors. you are careful to pick up all that you can see and find more with each barefoot trip through your bloodbath house."
Sunshine After Cloud,"Come, “Will,” let’s be good friends again, 
     Our wrongs let’s be forgetting, 
For words bring only useless pain, 
     So wherefore then be fretting. 
Let’s lay aside imagined wrongs, 
    And ne’er give way to grieving,
Life should be filled with joyous songs, 
    No time left for deceiving. 
I’ll try and not give way to wrath, 
    Nor be so often crying; 
There must some thorns be in our path, 
    Let’s move them now by trying. 
How, like a foolish pair were we, 
    To fume about a letter; 
Time is so precious, you and me; 
    Must spend ours doing better."
Again it is September,"   Again it is September! 
It seems so strange that I who made no vows
Should sit here desolate this golden weather 
And wistfully remember—
    A sigh of deepest yearning, 
A glowing look and words that knew no bounds, 
A swift response, an instant glad surrender
To kisses wild and burning! 
   Ay me! 
   Again it is September! 
It seems so strange that I who kept those vows 
Should sit here lone, and spent, and mutely praying 
That I may not remember! "
Learning Late Letters,"translated from Vietnamese by the author
The dead don't let us go, I say to my friend Sirius, putting my father's letters in a drawer. It is the plight of Mezentius that I endure, attached to a dead man, hand in hand, mouth in mouth, in a sad embrace. The letters stopped arriving from the country of my childhood. The man who wrote them died a solitary death and was buried at the edge of a stream. But he is there, his skin touches my skin, my breath gives life to his lips. He is there, I say to Sirius, when I speak to you, when I eat, when I sleep, when I take a walk. It seems to me that I am dead, whereas my father, the dead man who refuses to leave me in peace, overflows with life. He possesses me, sucks my blood, gnaws my bones, feeds on my thoughts. 1
  “Die fresh. Die withered.
Die sore. Die throbbing.
Die hard.  Die standing up.
Die lying down. Die
nightwise. Die more. Die
horrified. Die gradual. Die
corroding. Die squashed.
Die choking. Die fainting.
Die everything. Die all.
Die falling. Die swooning.
Die tense. Die loose. Die
now. Die spinning. Die
quashed. Die quelled. Die
rotting. Die crushed. Die
everyone. Die clean. Die
raw. Die bruised. Die
sitting. Die morningwise.
Die afternoonwise. Die
departing. Die undoing.”2
  In the last letter, the dying man taught me a lesson of 36 deadly tricks. He called them the 36 documentations of secret agencies, 36 spells of horror, 36 faces of vanity, 36 tactics of being deadly, 36 stratagems of dying. All night long, I chant his weird song over and over like a crazy heart. Dripping drops of time, the tune flies far from the propaganda of a human life. When Sirius asks why I keep murmuring the lines, I say, It helps me learn my fathertongue, glide into my childhood siesta, melt into my red hot girdle of earth. The letters of the dead burn me, urge me to speak to them, speak them, have them speak me, even in my sleep. Every dream is a chamber where the language drills, like vital winds, hum me anew, blowing me closer to the waters where my father lies. Every night he still sleeptalks his fatal rhythm through my broken tongue.

  Chant Chữ Chết
Người chết không buông tha chúng ta, tôi vừa nói với anh bạn Sirius vừa xếp những lá thư của cha tôi vào ngăn kéo. Đó là nhục hình Mézence mà tôi phải chịu, tức là bị buộc vào một người chết, tay áp tay, miệng kề miệng, trong một nụ hôn buồn. Những lá thư đã ngừng đến từ đất nước của tuổi thơ tôi. Người viết thư đã chết, một cái chết cô đơn, và được chôn bên bờ nước. Nhưng người vẫn đây, da người chạm da tôi, hơi thở tôi thổi sống làn môi ấy. Tôi bảo Sirius, Người ở đây này, khi tôi đang nói chuyện với anh, khi tôi ăn, khi tôi ngủ, khi tôi dạo chơi. Dường như tôi mới chính là người chết, còn cha tôi, người chết không để tôi yên ấy, lại đang ngập tràn sự sống. Người ám tôi, hút máu tôi, gặm xương tôi, ngốn suy nghĩ tôi. 1

  Trong thư cuối, người dạy tôi tổng cộng 36 kế chết người. Người dặn đây là 36 tài liệu công tác nguỵ quân nguỵ quyền, 36 phép rùng rợn, 36 vẻ phù hoa, 36 món chết người, 36 món chết.

Khi Sirius hỏi sao tôi cứ lẩm nhẩm lời người, tôi đáp, Để tôi học tiếng cha tôi, dạt vào giấc trưa tuổi thơ tôi, tan vào đất đỏ nhiệt đới tôi. Chữ người chết nung tôi, thúc tôi nói với họ, nói họ, rồi họ nói tôi, cả khi tôi ngủ. Mỗi giấc mơ là một căn phòng nơi những bài luyện chữ, như gió thổi, ngân tôi, tái thiết tôi, mang tôi cận kề con nước nơi cha tôi nằm. Hằng đêm người vẫn nói mớ một thứ phách nhịp chết người thấm xuyên lưỡi vỡ tôi.

The Check In,"They call. They message.
Then the occasional tag on social media.
I am wanting to check in on you… We
are thinking of you… I am so so sorry…
Then                  there                  I go
again                  pounding my head
sifting through thick
                            air
scattering names on a dusty floor
It is morning. It is the afternoon, maybe
the middle of some God-awful hour. I was
calm. I was hunkered low, shades drawn
maybe sipping a tea
                                                    No one
should see me    pacing kitchen
to porch
                                                 to bedroom
grabbing at lint or         shaking my wrist
                    in the mirror
                                                     Don’t call
don’t remind me there are soldiers
tramping on my lawn with gas
                                        and pepper spray.
I’ve just laid the sheets tight in my bed.
I’ve just trimmed the plants.
                                              And you are so white
and fragile with your checking. You are so late
so late so late."
In the Middle of the Burning,"notice now pictures of awful things on top our head
the freight that barricades this view, how enough
how the law batter down the dogged tide we make
the world shoring its dark scars between seasons
as though to hold it together only by a flame
is here a voice to please enough the blunt
borderlessness of this grief turning our heads to rubble
the lunacy of nothing so limning as death in the streets
in these vibrating hours where the corners talk back
need I simply run my tongue along the granite sky and live
to know how lost the millionth life somewhere today
the swift shape of roads new names combust, the sum
of anthems flooding the world with the eye’s sudden and narrow
saltwater and streets ziplined with screams at the pitch of cooking pots
then tear gas, then pepper spray, then militarized lies unzipping
body bags, oh, our many many there, our alive and just born,
and that is how to say let’s fuck it up, we the beat and we the loud
tuning forks and the help arriving empty-handed
propping the hot news of new times on our head
days like these pleat whatever the hollow year must offer
between the not-yet-dead and those just waking up
it will not be the vanished thing that we remember
it will be what we exchanged close to midnight
like smugglers high-wiring the city, hoarding the thoughts
of ours we interrupted midway to discovering the velocity
of the burning world below
of our language in the lateness of our stuck and reckless love
where the forces who claim they love us
level our lives to crust—the centuries-wide dance
of swapped shackles for knees
their batons and miscellany
thrown at our whole lives demanding our mothers
raise from their separate rooms, separate graves, today
to save who and me? I open the book to a naked page
where nothing clatter my heart, what head
what teeth cling to broadside, roll alias after
alias with a pen at their dull tribunes and shrines
imagine our heirlooms of shot nerves make a life
given to placards and synergies and elegies, but more
last things: where letters here where snow in May
where the millennium unstitches the quartered earth
in June, how many today to the viral fire
the frosted rich and their forts, but not
the fulsome rage of my people unpeaced
mute boots with somber looks appear
a fearsome autumn ending spring, though we still hear
I dare not sing
another song to dig a hole this time for the lineages
of magnolias where the offspring bring a hand to cover
our mouth, our heaping lives, who sit who burn who drop
three feet to the tar, who eat and demolish the thing
that takes our head, the thing that is no more
the place that never was except a burning learned
just once and not again when the darker working’s race"
"Carnivorous, with a varied and opportunistic diet","Call me lagahoo, soucouyant. Call me other.
I came ravenous: mongoose consuming
fresh landscapes until I made myself
new species of the Indies.
Christen me how you wish, my muzzle
matted with blood of fresh invertebrates.
I disappear your problems
without thought to consequence.
Call me Obeah. Watch me cut
through cane, chase
sugar-hungry rats. Giggling
at mating season, I grow fat
multiples, litters thick as tropic air.
Don’t you find me beautiful? My soft animal
features, this body streamlined ruthless,
claws that won’t retract. You desire them.
You never ask me what I want. I take
your chickens, your iguana,
you watch me and wonder
when you will be outnumbered.
My offspring stalking your village,
ecosystems uprooted, roosts
swallowed whole.
I am not native. Not domesticated.
I am naturalized, resistant
to snake venoms, your colony’s toxins—
everything you brought me to,
this land. I chew and spit back
reptile and bird bone
prophecy strewn across stones."
Caretaker,"She needs to eat. She needs
to keep something warm in
her stomach. I reheat rice on the stove,
some cabbage and smoked salmon
and bring it to her in bed.
Like a widow, she chews the end
of a bone already buried. Ignores
the plate. I make her sit up anyways
adjust just before she spits
her last meal into my hands. Warm,
half-digested ghost.
Downstairs in the kitchen
I’ll eat from this plate, the white grains
cold and dead, pinched in my fingers’
tight grip, raised to a mouth
emptied—already open.
And I’ll try to—no, I will,
I’ll keep it down."
"Today, God","I am liberated and focused today
on what it means to govern myself.
I am not watching the news
or wearing a bra.
I will not question America
or ask where it was last night.
I went to bed with a cold fact
With no cuddling, after.
Today, God I want nothing
not even the love I have been praying for.
On the train, I won’t offer
anyone my seat.
No one ever moves for me
Some days, not even the wind.
Today, I will be like the flag
that never waves.
At work, I will be black
and I will act like it.
They will mispronounce my name
And this time I won’t answer.
I will sit at my desk with my legs open
and my mind crossed."
The Plains of Peace,"Again my fancy takes its flight,
And soars away on thoughtful wing,
Again my soul thrills with delight,
And this the fancied theme, I sing,
From Earthly scenes awhile, I find release,
And dwell upon the restful Plains of Peace.
The Plains of Peace are passing fair,
Where naught disturbs and naught can harm,
I find no sorrow, woe or care,
These all are lost in perfect calm,
Bright are the joys, and pleasures never cease,
For those who dwell on the Plains of Peace.
No scorching sun or blighting storm,
No burning sand or desert drear,
No fell disease or wasting form,
To mar the glowing beauty here.
Decay and ruin ever must decrease,
Here on the fertile, healthful Plains of Peace.
What rare companionship I find,
What hours of social joy I spend,
What restfulness pervades my mind,
Communing with congenial friend.
True happiness seems ever to increase,
While dwelling here upon the Plains of Peace.
Ambitions too, are realized,
And that which I have sought on earth,
I find at last idealized,
My longings ripen into worth,
My fondest hopes no longer fear decease,
But bloom forth brightly on the Plains of Peace.
'Tis by my fancy, yet 'tis true,
That somewhere having done with Earth,
We shall another course pursue,
According to our aim or worth,
Our souls from mortal things must find release,
And dwell immortal on the Plains of Peace."
A Prayer,"As I lie in bed,
Flat on my back;
There passes across my ceiling
An endless panorama of things—
Quick steps of gay-voiced children,
Adolescence in its wondering silences,
Maid and man on moonlit summer’s eve,
Women in the holy glow of Motherhood,
Old men gazing silently thru the twilight
Into the beyond.
O God, give me words to make my dream-children live."
Denial is a Cliff We Are Driven Over,"I want to believe Don West
when he writes: none of mine
ever made their living by driving slaves.
But in my grandfather’s mouth that utterance
would’ve taken on another meaning:
In the memory my mother shares,
he is flitting across Louisville
in his taxi, passing back-and-forth
like a cardinal, red-faced, proud-breasted,
delivering Black folks their dry cleaning—
had to, she tells me, as part of his route—
but once he started his second shift and turned
on the cab light, he wouldn’t accept
Black fare. I recall him reciting
the early presidents’
racist pseudoscience—American
at its liver—to rationalize his hatred
of my father, his denial
of my Blackness. That denial a peril
I survived, a cliff he could have driven me over
at any moment of my childhood. Maybe,
I want to think, because they were poor men
who labored, farmed tobacco and dug for oil,
my grandfather’s people resisted
slavery, felt a kinship with my father’s people.
Or that because my grandfather
was one of eleven mouths to feed
on their homestead—reduced to dirt
across the Great Depression—
he had a white identity to be proud of, a legacy
that didn’t join our names
in a bill of sale, but in struggle.
I search his surname and it travels
back to Germany, appears
on the deed to the house he inherited,
retired and died in, poor-white resentment
inflaming his stomach and liver.
But when I search the name I share with my father,
my only inheritance                      disappears
into the 19th century, sixth generation:
my ancestor bred
to produce 248 offspring
for his owner, from whence comes
our family name. Mr. West, here
we are different. Here, is where
my grandfather found his love for me discordant
as the voice of the dead whispering
history. Here is where we are connected,
not by class, but blood & slavery."
"One Fire, Quenched with Another","             1.
Pained as he was when he gazed 
upon his father’s face, he held his gaze.
             2.
Toward what he’d never known, he walked,
somehow both arrogant & begging.
The purple of his father’s robes, like a bruise. 
             3.
As a river, over time, can forge
a way through stone, so
absence bore through him,
leaving a valley where his voice
echoes off the canyon walls. 
             4.
His mind had narrowed until all it held
was an idea of father, until so fixed on the idea
his mind seemed under siege. Inside him hummed
a longing, one he felt compelled to fix, so named it flaw.
             5.
What the boy wanted:
to finally know his father’s face.
Evidence, at last, of his origin. 
             6.
Felt within, a longing.
Felt and therefore knew
a weakness he wanted to master. 
             7.
A desire to know, and a belief
he deserved to,
these were the human parts of him.
             8. 
Fiery, Dawnsteed, Scorcher, Blaze–
the horses the father owned,
the horses the father, knowing he would fail, let his son steer–
             9.
is this devotion?
             10.
To master, control, rein in;
hoping this might prove him 
a man, perhaps, a god.
             11.
There are gaps knowing cannot fill.
             12.
What boy has not dreamt himself a noble son,
has not prematurely thought himself a man?
             13.
                           He lost control of the reins
& the horses did what one expects
from animals whose lives had always been 
tightly squeezed between two fists:
             14.
breaking from the path they’d always known,
             15.
they galloped nearer to that world from which they’d been kept, 
             16.
not out of malice but a kind of mercy
             17.
for the world the father feared the horses would destroy.
             18.
Finding himself at the mercy of what he’d sought–
             19.
gone too far to turn back, gone far beyond his father now
with further still to go, ignorant of the names
of the horses behind whom he was now dragged like the tail
of a comet hurtling toward earth, as in all directions
he sees the destruction he’d caused:
the flames licking trees at their roots, licking
dry the ocean’s mouth, licking the faces
of each living thing until they’d turned to ash,
until the world without grew hotter than the world within,
until a dizzying heat rose from the soil, until in his feet
             20.
the boy could feel the world ablaze–
             21.
free me from these reins
he cried perhaps to god, 
perhaps to father, 
             22.
the difference indecipherable, more or less insignificant
             23.
for even though he’d met him, the boy still knew himself
             24.
fatherless, godless, no less abandoned than he’d been.
             25.
The world to which, for better or worse, he once belonged, now gone, 
             26.
he belonged nowhere… 
             27.
To save what could be saved, to salvage what had not been lost,
to punish his failure to master what no other ever had: the boy
             28.
was struck dead & buried
             29.
beside a river, which began again to flow toward the distant mouth 
             30.
out of which, it would finally empty."
Did anyone ever ask any one of Nikita’s daughters,"after Alexander Pushkin
Did anyone ever ask any one of Nikita’s daughters
if they wanted a vagina from the devil’s basket.
conjured by a witch and stored with so little ice.
an organ that had been ridden cross-country on
horseback. had no mind of its own and had flown
up into the trees with all thirty-nine to get stuck up
in the leaves. Clearly not queer at all given that it flew
down at the site of any old whatsit. and furthermore
not even to fuck it, just to crawl back into a box
like the whatsit wanted of the crew of thingums. Witch
only knows how many grimy fingers the poor things
endured. No one asked the tzar’s daughters
if they wouldn’t rather be holeless, lipless and better
unbewitched by devil and hag and flasher
envoy and kingly pop than to lift their skirts
to anyone wanting to see what was missing. or unmissed."
Vacation End,"From the charm of radiant faces,
From the days we took to dream,
From the joy of open spaces,
From the mountain and the stream,
Bronzed of sunlight, nerves a-tingle,
Keen of limb and clear of head,
Speed we back again to mingle
In the battle for our bread.
Now again the stern commanding
Of the chosen task is heard,
And the tyrant, care, is standing
Arbiter of deed and word.
But the radiance is not ended,
And the joy, whate’er the cost,
Which those fleeting days attended
Never can be wholly lost.
For we bring to waiting duty,
To the labor and the strife,
Something of the sense of beauty,
And a fairer view of life."
It’s a Long Way,"It’s a long way the sea-winds blow
    Over the sea-plains blue,—
But longer far has my heart to go
    Before its dreams come true.
It’s work we must, and love we must,
    And do the best we may,
And take the hope of dreams in trust
    To keep us day by day.
It’s a long way the sea-winds blow—
    But somewhere lies a shore—
Thus down the tide of Time shall flow
    My dreams forevermore."
By Inch-Meal a Disease,"Maggot & Mosquito mother infectious
encounters. Call home to the fen. Flooding

I picture skin, inch by inch conversion
to new flesh. Without medicine i’ve seen the body
be made a speedy disposal. Dejected ground.
Profitable & prosper both contain pro.
Prospero Prospero Prospero.
I too have made incantation
of the man’s name

He planted a flag & dispensed

The water is enclosing, body
thinning in a baptism of English.
I could say that colonialism was a disease,
but that would suggest a cure."
Black Credit,"Lord—
Your good daughter I have been
my whole life.
I’ve kept your house
clean as sucked bone,
starved myself of everything
your other children have told me is sin.
I’ve sharpened my teeth on the slate
of your Word for your work’s sake.
Bridled the glint of my tongue
so men will feel strong
and not be seen trembling
under the soft of it.
I’ve behaved
and for what
do I hunger, myself growing slight
on tomorrow’s meat:
words, words, your words
as valued here as Black credit
at an all-American bank.
They say, Lord, piety is speaking to you,
but madness is hearing you
speak back. And under this,
like all good jokes lies
the truth: no one
in this equation seems to be listening
anyway. To you, to our own damned selves.
Tell me
how many Black girls
does it take to change a mind,
or a home           or a block
or a scale            or a heart
or a course          or a country?
You, Lord, as you have
with your other minor prophets,
have dragged—or is it called us
up the mountain, where in the thin air
there are those who got here
long before I ever dreamed of it,
still waiting on you
to finally cash this check."
Menace to,"after June Jordan
Nightly my enemies feast on my comrades
like maggots on money. Money being my enemy
as plastic is my enemy. My enemy everywhere
and in my home as wifi is
a money for me to reach my comrades
and kills my house plants. My enemy
is distance growing dark, distance growing
politely in my pocket as connection.
I must become something my enemies can’t eat, don’t have
a word for yet, my enemies being literate as a drone is
well-read and precise and quiet, as when I buy something
such as a new computer with which to sing against my enemies,
there is my enemy, silent and personal."
Dewdrops,"Watch the dewdrops in the morning,
   Shake their little diamond heads,
Sparkling, flashing, ever moving,
   From their silent little beds.
See the grass! Each blade is brightened,
   Roots are strengthened by their stay;
Like the dewdrops, let us scatter
   Gems of love along the way."
Together,"O, come, Love, let us take a walk,
Down the Way-of-Life together;
Storms may come, but what care we,
If be fair or foul the weather.
When the sky overhead is blue,
Balmy, scented winds will after
Us, adown the valley blow
Haunting echoes of our laughter.
When Life’s storms upon us beat
Crushing us with fury, after
All is done, there’ll ringing come
Mocking echoes of our laughter.
So we’ll walk the Way-of-Life,
You and I, Love, both together,
Storm or sunshine, happy we
If be foul or fair the weather."
ALL Y’ALL REALLY FROM ALABAMA,"“...The straitjackets of race prejudice and discrimination do not wear only southern labels. The subtle, psychological technique of the North has approached in its ugliness and victimization of the Negro the outright terror and open brutality of the South.”
            ― Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., Why We Can't Wait (Beacon Press, 2011)

Absolute,"The summer I was ten a teenager
named Kim butterflied my hair. Cornrows
curling into braids 
behind each ear.
Everybody’s wearing this style now, Kim said.
Who could try to tell me
I wasn’t beautiful. The magic
in something as once ordinary
as hair that for too long 
had not been good enough
now winged and amazing 
now connected 
to a long line of crowns.
Now connected
to a long line of girls
moving through Brooklyn with our heads
held so high, our necks ached. You must 
know this too – that feeling 
of being so much more than
you once believed yourself to be
so much more than your
too-skinny arms
and too-big feet and
too-long fingers and
too-thick and stubborn hair
All of us now
suddenly seen
the trick mirror that had us believe
we weren’t truly beautiful
suddenly shifts
and there we are
and there we are
and there we are again
and Oh! How could we not have seen
ourselves before? So much more
We are so much more."
Venus & Serena Play Doubles On Center Court,"I find an upscale bistro with a big screen at the bar.
The Williams Sisters will step out on to this Center Court,
for the very first time as a team. I celebrate the event
with my very first Cosmopolitan. I feel like a kid
watching TV in the Before Times: miraculously, Nat King Cole or
Pearl Bailey would appear on the Dinah Shore Show or Ed Sullivan.
Amazed, we’d run to the phone, call up the aunts and cousins.
Quick! Turn on Channel 10!... Three minutes of pride...
Smiling at no one in particular, I settle in to enjoy the match.
What is the commentator saying? He thinks it’s important
to describe their opponents to us: one is “dark,”
the other “blonde.” He just can’t bring himself to say:
Venus & Serena. Look at these two Classy Sisters:
Serious. Strategic. Black. Pounding History."
Duplex: Black Mamas Praying,"Black Mamas stay on their knees praying. Cursing
the lies folks tell ‘bout how the world don’t need you—
“The world don’t need you” is a lie folks tell themselves
when they step over blood gelled black and slick.
Folks step over black blood gelled and slick to get
on with things—don’t bring bones to the cemetery.
Bones in the cemetery, hear the prophecy:
—together, bone to bone—tendons and flesh—skin—
bone to bone—tendons and flesh—skin—together,
four winds breathe into these slain, that they may live—
—breathe, four winds, into these slain. That they may live—
Calling forth prophecy is no light work, No—
but, for Joshua, the sun stood still—the moon stopped.
Black Mamas stay on your knees praying—praying—"
American Girl Dolls Attend Mandatory Diversity Training,"MEET KIRSTEN. Wears milkmaid braids to conserve her swedish past. Relinquished herself to assimilation at 8 after saying bye to her bff Singing Bird, whose tribe was forced off their land. “1854 was a wild year for me, guys. Cancel culture is real, but how could I disown my family for the racist things they say? How could I even point out that the things they say are racist? Like, how could I even say ‘Can you consider the words coming out of your mouth & never say them again?’” 
MEET MOLLY. Buys baguettes on mondays and wears a beret literally everywhere. Obsessed with hollywood films and harsh realities. Surprisingly patriotic despite her love of all things british, especially plaid. An expert on taking up space. When the trainer asks if anyone can define discrimination, she pulls out a legal pad “I can’t even tell you how many times I’ve been discriminated against because I’m a woman. I write literally every instance down as proof. Exactly how many hours do we have?”
MEET SAMANTHA. 25-year-old well-meaning rule lover who enjoys progress and satin. Would like to be a painter or possibly the president of the united states of america. Out of the two AMA questions received before the training, both came from her. One for each black person she’s ever talked to in her life. “1) This is more of a comment than anything, but I don’t understand why I can’t be curious about Addy’s hair 2) Remind me again, what’s the difference between equality and equity?”
MEET FELICITY. Wears wide brim hats for horse races and can stitch the shit out of anything. Makes a mean southern sweet tea just like her mommy used to in the old virginia colony. When the diversity trainer asks if anyone can recall a time in their lives when they’ve been racist, she has a hard time pinning down just one time. “Sure I could, but I’d rather focus on rescuing horses from alopecia than spend a few hours at this dumb-ass training. Honestly, who has the time for any of this?”
MEET ADDY. Just look at all these dolls crying, complaining and getting paid for it all. Meanwhile hot girl summer came and left and I’m still stuck here performing history. Imma just slap the next bitch who tries to buy me. The scholars who brought me to life built the best american story but forgot two key facts. 1) I’m tired of being sold  2) less than half the people who buy me actually listen. But if I raised my hand right now & asked “Do I really need to be here?” you think my boss would just let me leave? "
The Black Queen,"All hail! This honest dusky maid,
    Let all others prostrate fall;
Bring forth the international diadem,
    And crown her queen of all.
In all pure womanly qualities,
    She stands serene and tall,
Way up above the average,
    This makes her queen of all.
She’s not a sluggard at any place,
    She answers duty’s call
Come all ye people, small and great,
    And crown her queen of all.
She stands bolt upright by her men,
    She will not let them fall,
Now for her valor, tip your hat,
    And crown her queen of all."
For my Brother(s),"My brother was a dark-skinned boy
with a sweet tooth, a smart mouth,
and a wicked thirst. At seventeen,
when I left him for America, his voice
was staticked with approaching adulthood,
he ate everything in the house, grew
what felt like an inch a day, and wore
his favorite shirt until mom disappeared it.
Tonight I’m grateful he slaked his thirst
in another country, far from this place
where a black boy’s being calls like crosshairs
to conscienceless men with guns and conviction.
I remember my brother’s ashy knees
and legs, how many errands he ran on them
up and down roads belonging to no one
and every one. And I’m grateful
he was a boy in a country of black boys,
in the time of walks to the store
on Aunty Marge’s corner to buy contraband
sweeties and sweetdrinks with change
snuck from mom’s handbag or dad’s wallet—
how that was a black boy’s biggest transgression,
and so far from fatal it feels an un-American dream.
Tonight, I think of my brother
as a black boy’s lifeless body spins me
into something like prayer—a keening
for the boy who went down the road, then
went down fighting, then went down dead.
My brother was a boy in the time of fistfights
he couldn’t win and that couldn’t stop
him slinging his weapon tongue anyway,
was a boy who went down fighting,
and got back up wearing his black eye
like a trophy. My brother who got up,
who grew up, who got to keep growing.
Tonight I am mourning the black boys
who are not my brother and who are
my brothers. I am mourning the boys
who walk the wrong roads, which is any road
in America. Tonight I am mourning
the death warrant hate has made of their skin—
black and bursting with such ordinary
hungers and thirsts, such abundant frailty,
such constellations of possibility, our boys
who might become men if this world spared them,
if it could see them whole—boys, men, brothers—human."
You Still Dream,"Here, poem meets prayer.
We are exceedingly comfortable
with posturing and self-defense
that masquerade as apology.
But what’s needed in this moment
is unmixed confession
of our nation’s sin,
deep and indefensible.
“Now I lay me down to sleep”
must make way for
something more muscular:
sack cloth and ashes,
prayer and fasting,
naked prostration.
Daniel understood
radical repentance begins
with this unvarnished profession:
You are righteous,
and we are not.
Please heal our nation.
Cleanse our stubborn hearts.
Show each of us what part to play.
Broken as Judah and Jerusalem,
we cry and come bending our will
toward the good
you dream for us still,
no matter our sin,
no matter what skin
we’re in."
From “Perspective is Supposed to Yield Clarity”,"She said, I wish I prayed, I would pray for you. And,
we all wanted a shape of prayer in our brains, taking over
instead of it chomping on itself. Stupid little elf. God has
never come to me. We surrender in the teeming utterance
of materials soaked with sentences already made in air
and by machines. The country says Freedom, crushed under
its own dream weight. I did not make up this song. Design
Within Reach is having a “Work from home sale.” The coming
apart, the giant laceration across the sky, we all feel it. Look
at the fire, look at it, like all the rage of all the smallest beings."
The Secret of Youth,"Last night I asked my mother to cornrow my hair
A skill I had been practicing since last summer
But always ended with a tumbleweed excuse of a braid
My black has always resided in braids
In tango fingers that work through tangles
Translating geometry from hands to head
For years my hair was cultivated into valleys and hills
That refused to be ironed out with a brush held in my hand
I have depended on my mother to make them plains
I am 18 and still sit between my mother’s knees
I still welcome the cracks of her knuckles in my ears
They whisper to me and tell me the secret of youth
I want to be 30 sitting between my mother’s knees
Her fingers keeping us both young while organizing my hair
I never want to flatten the hills by myself
I want the brush in her hand forever"
Legacy,"Now and then the phone will ring and it will be
someone from my youth. The voice of a favorite cousin
stretched across many miles sounding exactly as she always has:
that trained concentration of one who stutters—
the slight hesitations, the drawn-out syllables,
the occasional lapse into a stammer.
When asked, she says my aunt is well for her age but
she forgets. I remember the last time I saw my aunt—
leaning on her cane, skin smooth as river rock,
mahogany brown, gray hair braided into two plaits
stretched atop her head and held in place
with black bobby pins.
She called to say James Lee has died. And did I know
Aunt Mary, who had four crippled children
and went blind after uncle Benny died, died last year?
I did not.
We wander back awhile, reminding and remembering:
Me under the streetlight outside our front yard
face buried in the crook of my arm held close
to the telephone pole as I closed my eyes and sang the words:
Last night, night before, twenty-four robbers at my door
I got up to let them in... hit ‘em in the head with a rolling pin,
then counted up to ten while they ran and hid.
Visiting the graves of grandparents I never knew.
Placing blush-pink peonies my father grew and cut
for the occasion into mason jars. Saying nothing.
Simply staring at the way our lives come down
to a concrete slab."
fleeing,"everything i do comes down to the fact that i’ve been here before.
in some arrangement of my atoms i was allowed to be free
so don’t ask me when freedom is coming
when a certain eye of mine has seen it,
a cornea in a convoluted future recalls my freedom.
when asked about the absence of freedom, the lack of it
i laugh at the word absence, which always suggests
a presence that has left. but absence is the arena
of death, and we call the dead free (went on to glory), what
is the absence of freedom but an assumption of it?
i have never longed for something
which was not once mine. even fiction is my possession,
and flight is an act of fleeing as much as an act of flying."
Forget Me Not,"When in the morning’s misty hour,
When the sun beams gently o’er each flower;
When thou dost cease to smile benign,
And think each heart responds with thine,
When seeking rest among divine,
                                    Forget me not.
When the last rays of twilight fall,
And thou art pacing yonder hall;
When mists are gathering on the hill,
Nor sound is heard save mountain rill,
When all around bids peace be still,
                                    Forget me not.
When the first star with brilliance bright,
Gleams lonely o’er the arch of night;
When the bright moon dispels the gloom,
And various are the stars that bloom,
And brighten as the sun at noon,
                                    Forget me not.
When solemn sighs the hollow wind,
And deepen’d thought enraps the mind;
If e’er thou doest in mournful tone,
E’er sigh because thou feel alone,
Or wrapt in melancholy prone,
                                    Forget me not. 
When bird does wait thy absence long,
Nor tend unto its morning song;
While thou art searching stoic page,
Or listening to an ancient sage,
Whose spirit curbs a mournful rage,
                                    Forget me not.
Then when in silence thou doest walk,
Nor being round with whom to talk;
When thou art on the mighty deep,
And do in quiet action sleep;
If we no more on earth do meet,
                                    Forget me not.
When brightness round thee long shall bloom,
And knelt remembering those in gloom;
And when in deep oblivion's shade,
This breathless, mouldering form is laid,
And thy terrestrial body staid,
                                     Forget me not.
“Should sorrow cloud thy coming years,
And bathe thy happiness in tears,
Remember, though we’re doom’d to part,
There lives one fond and faithful heart,
                        That will forget thee not.”"
Solitude,"Oh, solitude, where is the sting,
    That men ascribe to thee?
Where is the terror in thy mien?
    I look, but cannot see.
Where hidest thou, that loneliness
    The world pretends to fear?
While lying on thy loving breast
    I find my sweetest cheer.
They do not understand thee, no,
    They are but knaves or fools,
Or else they must discern in thee
    Dame Nature’s queen of schools.
For in thy care, with naught but books,
    The bards and saints of old,
Become my friends and to mine ear
    Their mystic truths unfold.
When problems and perplexities
    Of life becloud my mind,
I know in thee, oh, solitude,
    The answer I can find.
When grief and sorrow crowd my heart
    To breaking, with their fears
Within thy arms, oh, solitude,
    I find relief in tears.
And when I weary of the world’s
    Deceits and cares and strife,
I find in thee sweet rest and peace
    And vigorous new life.
My garden never is complete
    Without a blooming rose,
Nor is my life, oh, solitude,
    Without thy sweet repose."
I Do Not Know the Spelling of Money,"I go to the railroad tracks
And follow them to the station of my enemies
A cobalt-toothed man pitches pennies
at my mugshot negative
All over the united states, there are
Toddlers in the rock
I see why everyone out here
got in the big cosmic basket
And why blood agreements mean a lot
And why I get shot back at
I understand the psycho-spiritual refusal
to write white history or take the glass freeway
White skin tattooed on my right forearm
Ricochet sewage near where I collapsed
into a rat-infested manhood
My new existence as living graffiti
In the kitchen with
a lot of gun cylinders to hack up
House of God in part
No cops in part
My body brings down the Christmas
The new bullets pray over blankets made from old bullets
Pray over the 28th hour’s next beauty mark
Extrajudicial confederate statue restoration
the waist band before the next protest poster
By the way,
Time is not an illusion, your honor
I will save your desk for last
You are witty, your honor
You’re moving money again, your honor
It is only raining one thing: non-white cops
And prison guard shadows
Reminding me of
Spoiled milk floating on an oil spill
A neighborhood making a lot of fuss over its demise
A new lake for a Black Panther Party
Malcom X’s ballroom jacket slung over my son’s shoulders
The figment of village
a noon noose to a new white preacher
             -All in an abstract painting of a president
Bought slavers some time, didn’t it?
The tantric screeches of military bolts and Election-Tuesday cars
A cold-blooded study in leg irons
Proof that some white people have actually fondled nooses
             That sundown couples
             made their vows of love over
                        opaque peach plastic
                        and bolt action audiences      
Man, the Medgar Evers-second is definitely my favorite law of science
Fondled news clippings and primitive Methodists
My arm changes imperialisms
Simple policing vs. Structural frenzies
Elementary school script vs. Even whiter white spectrums
Artless bleeding and
the challenge of watching civilians think

“terrible rituals they have around the corner.
They let their elders beg for public mercy”
“I am going to go ahead and sharpen these kids’ heads
into arrows myself and see
how much gravy spills out of family crests.”
Modern fans of war
              What with their t-shirt poems
              And t-shirt guilt
And me, having on the cheapest pair of shoes on the bus,
I have no choice but to read the city walls for signs of my life"
In the Eighties We Did the Wop,"If you end your crusades for the great race,  
then I will end my reenactments of flying, 
and if you lean down to smell a painted trillium, 
then I will cast a closer eye on those amber waves,  
and if you stop killing black children,  
then I will turn my drums to the sea and away from  
your wounded mountains. Who mothered your love of death? 
Here is a heart-shaped stone to rub when you feel fear rising; 
give me anything, an empty can of Pabst, a plastic souvenir, a t-shirt from Daytona.  
Here is a first edition: The Complete Poems of Lucille Clifton.  
Give me an ancient grove and a conversation by a creek, charms  
to salve my griefs, something that says you are human, 
and I will give you the laughter in my brain and the tranquil eyes of my uncles.  
Show me your grin in the middle of winter. 
In the eighties we did the wop; you, too, have your dances.  
It is like stealing light from a flash in the sky. I promise:  
no one is blaming you. No one is trying to replace you. 
It’s just that you are carrying a tainted clock calling it European History, 
standing in khakis, eyes frightened like a mess of beetles. "
Red Wine Spills,"I am hovering over this rug
with a hair dryer on high in my hand
I have finally, inevitably, spilled
red wine on this impractically white
housewarming hand-me-down from my cousin, who
clearly, and incorrectly, thought this was a good idea
With the help of a little panic,
sparkling water and a washcloth,
I am stunned by how quickly the wine washes out,
how I was sure this mistake would find me
every day with its gaping mouth, reminding me
of my own propensity for failure
and yet, here I am
with this clean slate
The rug is made of fur,
which means it died
to be here
It reminds me of my own survival
and everyone who has taught me
to shake loose the shadow of death
I think of inheritance, how this rug
was passed on to me through blood,
how this animal gave its blood
so that I may receive the gift of its death
and be grateful for it
I think of our inability
to control stories of origin
how history does not wash away
with water and a good scrub 
I think of evolution,
what it means to make it through
this world with your skin intact,
how flesh is fragile
but makes a needle and thread
of itself when necessary
I think of all that I have inherited,
all the bodies buried for me to be here
and stay here, how I was born with grief
and gratitude in my bones
And I think of legacy,
how I come from a long line of sorcerers
who make good work of building
joy from absolutely nothing
And what can I do with that
but pour another glass,
thank the stars
for this sorceress blood
and keep pressing forward"
My dad buried two dogs in the backyard:,"Bird dogs, they say—
the kind that chase something in flight.
try to capture with its teeth
a winged ceremony,
feathers dripping from each of their mouths.
The first dog was just plain old.
The second died of a heart worm pill —my father neglected to purchase.
What else has he let die?
My mother fixed his plate every night,
never bought a car, or shoes, or skirt
without his permission.
She birthed children and raised them.
She, my sister, and I—
winged things in the air.
I knew there was blood under the ground.
No surprise when I found the house was sinking.
Our dogs always stayed outside, not allowed
in the living room.
Only the basement,
where my father stayed, slept, fixed things.
My mother, a silent companion.
The dog barks and my father goes running.
The dog dies
and we bury my mother.
Graves for everyone
We bark
and feathers fall from my father’s teeth.
He barks and becomes the tree.
The bark remembers phantom noose
and screams.
The screech becomes a bullet
without a window to land through,
just a body,
a backyard,
a shovel."
Match,"on the days the dark is vanta vicious
enough to swallow whole every holy
thing like my mother and the stigmata
she bleeds from a totem of raising black
on the days the cold is cold as all get out but
there’s no place to get in when even breath is
blade and hurts to think of thinking of breathing
let alone laughing
on the days I feel frayed and ‘fraid ripped
and torn from the lot plucked from family
and ‘nem and even myself sometimes my
name is the name of a stranger
my face still the face in the hole of a
hoodie just snatched out my own world
never mine and dragged and scraped
across the rough textured parts of this
being alive thing
i’m reminded of what it feels
like to have my head alight to
have it catch fire and blaze-lick
high above me and all this
i’m reminded to return to the truth that oh
yeah me my little self a match my little
self a cardboard cutout might could burn
this whole so-called kingdom down"
The Puppet-Player,"Sometimes it seems as though some puppet-player,
   A clenched claw cupping a craggy chin
Sits just beyond the border of our seeing,
   Twitching the strings with slow, sardonic grin."
I Saw You,"I saw you as I passed last night,
    Framed in a sky of gold;
And through the sun’s fast paling light
    You seemed a queen of old,
Whose smile was light to all the world
    Against the crowding dark.
And in my soul a song there purled—
    Re-echoed by the lark.
I saw you as I passed last night,
    Your tresses burnished gold,
While in your eyes a happy bright
    Gleam of your friendship told.
And I went singing on my way;
    On, on into the dark.
But in my heart still shone the day,
    And still—still sang the lark."
This Little Light of Mine Speaks,
After Robert Fuller,"Will the new aunt Jemima have dreads?
Why did Susan Smith kill her children and blame a black man?
Would a black man hang himself from a tree with his backpack still on?
Is it justice or revenge we are seeking?
What does justice look like?
What else can I do to feel safe?
Several times a day I stab my fingertips to threads
Looking for something more than blood as a reminder of life
An angry rain whips the window
We lay quiet in bed
Invite Kimiko Hahn to serenade us with her new poems
When she's done   my lover says
Give me something   something to munch on
I offer her my wrist."
"My Mother, My Mother","When I was a child I would run
through the backyard while my father
yanked dandelions, daisies, thistles, crabgrass,
mowed, rearranged the stones around the porch—
the task of men, though I didn’t know.
Blushed with cartoons and chocolate milk
one Saturday, I found a bee working
a dandelion for its treasure the way
only God’s creatures can, giving
and giving until all that is left
is the act itself—and there’s faith, too,
my mother used to say in her magnolia lilt.
It comes as it comes—there’s a road to follow.
When I swat the bee, I plea in triumph.
My father, knee-drenched in manhood,
grins and his gold tooth glistens a likely tale.
And when the bee stings my ear,
I run to him screaming as my mother
runs outside hearing her only child’s voice
peel back the wallpaper. She charms my ear
with kisses. This afternoon, I notice a bee
trapped inside the window as my mother
on the phone tries to still her voice
to say her mother has died. I wonder if he can
taste the sadness, the man on TV tells the other.
The bee is so calm. The room enlists
a fresh haunting, and the doorframe bothers.
To believe her when she says—
as the bouquet of yellow roses on the dresser
bows its head and the angles of my clay bloom
with fire—it’ll be okay, is my duty as son.
My mother sits in the hospital in San Antonio,
motherless—my mother is now a mother
without the longest love she’s ever known.
My mother who used to wake up
before the slap of sunrise with my father
to build new rooftops. My mother who wrote
“I pray you have a great day”
on stupid notes tucked in my lunchbox.
My mother who told the white woman 
in Ross to apologize for bumping into me
as I knocked over a rack of pantyhose.
My mother who cried in Sea-Tac airport
as I walked through customs, yes-ing
the woman who asks, Is it his first time
moving from home? My mother who looks
at me with glinted simper when the pastor spouts
“disobedient children.” My mother who was told
at a young age she’d never give birth,
barren as she were. My mother, my mother.
What rises inside me, I imagine inside her, although
I’ve never had a mother leave this earth.
I’ve never been without love."
Hyperion,"Book I
Deep in the shady sadness of a vale
Far sunken from the healthy breath of morn,
Far from the fiery noon, and eve’s one star,
Sat gray-hair’d Saturn, quiet as a stone,
Still as the silence round about his lair;
Forest on forest hung about his head
Like cloud on cloud. No stir of air was there,
Not so much life as on a summer’s day
Robs not one light seed from the feather’d grass,
But where the dead leaf fell, there did it rest.
A stream went voiceless by, still deadened more
By reason of his fallen divinity
Spreading a shade: the Naiad ’mid her reeds
Press’d her cold finger closer to her lips.
    Along the margin-sand large foot-marks went,
No further than to where his feet had stray’d,
And slept there since. Upon the sodden ground
His old right hand lay nerveless, listless, dead,
Unsceptred; and his realmless eyes were closed;
While his bow’d head seem’d list’ning to the Earth,
His ancient mother, for some comfort yet.
    It seem’d no force could wake him from his place;
But there came one, who with a kindred hand
Touch’d his wide shoulders, after bending low
With reverence, though to one who knew it not.
She was a Goddess of the infant world;
By her in stature the tall Amazon
Had stood a pigmy’s height: she would have ta’en
Achilles by the hair and bent his neck;
Or with a finger stay’d Ixion’s wheel.
Her face was large as that of Memphian sphinx,
Pedestal’d haply in a palace court,
When sages look’d to Egypt for their lore.
But oh! how unlike marble was that face:
How beautiful, if sorrow had not made
Sorrow more beautiful than Beauty’s self.
There was a listening fear in her regard,
As if calamity had but begun;
As if the vanward clouds of evil days
Had spent their malice, and the sullen rear
Was with its stored thunder labouring up.
One hand she press’d upon that aching spot
Where beats the human heart, as if just there,
Though an immortal, she felt cruel pain:
The other upon Saturn’s bended neck
She laid, and to the level of his ear
Leaning with parted lips, some words she spake
In solemn tenour and deep organ tone:
Some mourning words, which in our feeble tongue
Would come in these like accents; O how frail
To that large utterance of the early Gods!
“Saturn, look up!—though wherefore, poor old King?
I have no comfort for thee, no not one:
I cannot say, ’O wherefore sleepest thou?’
For heaven is parted from thee, and the earth
Knows thee not, thus afflicted, for a God;
And ocean too, with all its solemn noise,
Has from thy sceptre pass’d; and all the air
Is emptied of thine hoary majesty.
Thy thunder, conscious of the new command,
Rumbles reluctant o’er our fallen house;
And thy sharp lightning in unpractised hands
Scorches and burns our once serene domain.
O aching time! O moments big as years!
All as ye pass swell out the monstrous truth,
And press it so upon our weary griefs
That unbelief has not a space to breathe.
Saturn, sleep on:—O thoughtless, why did I
Thus violate thy slumbrous solitude?
Why should I ope thy melancholy eyes?
Saturn, sleep on! while at thy feet I weep.”
    As when, upon a tranced summer-night,
Those green-rob’d senators of mighty woods,
Tall oaks, branch-charmed by the earnest stars,
Dream, and so dream all night without a stir,
Save from one gradual solitary gust
Which comes upon the silence, and dies off,
As if the ebbing air had but one wave;
So came these words and went; the while in tears
She touch’d her fair large forehead to the ground,
Just where her falling hair might be outspread
A soft and silken mat for Saturn’s feet.
One moon, with alteration slow, had shed
Her silver seasons four upon the night,
And still these two were postured motionless,
Like natural sculpture in cathedral cavern;
The frozen God still couchant on the earth,
And the sad Goddess weeping at his feet:
Until at length old Saturn lifted up
His faded eyes, and saw his kingdom gone,
And all the gloom and sorrow of the place,
And that fair kneeling Goddess; and then spake,
As with a palsied tongue, and while his beard
Shook horrid with such aspen-malady:
“O tender spouse of gold Hyperion,
Thea, I feel thee ere I see thy face;
Look up, and let me see our doom in it;
Look up, and tell me if this feeble shape
Is Saturn’s; tell me, if thou hear’st the voice
Of Saturn; tell me, if this wrinkling brow,
Naked and bare of its great diadem,
Peers like the front of Saturn. Who had power
To make me desolate? whence came the strength?
How was it nurtur’d to such bursting forth,
While Fate seem’d strangled in my nervous grasp?
But it is so; and I am smother’d up,
And buried from all godlike exercise
Of influence benign on planets pale,
Of admonitions to the winds and seas,
Of peaceful sway above man’s harvesting,
And all those acts which Deity supreme
Doth ease its heart of love in.—I am gone
Away from my own bosom: I have left
My strong identity, my real self,
Somewhere between the throne, and where I sit
Here on this spot of earth. Search, Thea, search!
Open thine eyes eterne, and sphere them round
Upon all space: space starr’d, and lorn of light;
Space region’d with life-air; and barren void;
Spaces of fire, and all the yawn of hell.—
Search, Thea, search! and tell me, if thou seest
A certain shape or shadow, making way
With wings or chariot fierce to repossess
A heaven he lost erewhile: it must—it must
Be of ripe progress—Saturn must be King.
Yes, there must be a golden victory;
There must be Gods thrown down, and trumpets blown
Of triumph calm, and hymns of festival
Upon the gold clouds metropolitan,
Voices of soft proclaim, and silver stir
Of strings in hollow shells; and there shall be
Beautiful things made new, for the surprise
Of the sky-children; I will give command:
Thea! Thea! Thea! where is Saturn?”
    This passion lifted him upon his feet,
And made his hands to struggle in the air,
His Druid locks to shake and ooze with sweat,
His eyes to fever out, his voice to cease.
He stood, and heard not Thea’s sobbing deep;
A little time, and then again he snatch’d
Utterance thus.—“But cannot I create?
Cannot I form? Cannot I fashion forth
Another world, another universe,
To overbear and crumble this to nought?
Where is another chaos? Where?”—That word
Found way unto Olympus, and made quake
The rebel three.—Thea was startled up,
And in her bearing was a sort of hope,
As thus she quick-voic’d spake, yet full of awe.
    “This cheers our fallen house: come to our friends,
O Saturn! come away, and give them heart;
I know the covert, for thence came I hither.”
Thus brief; then with beseeching eyes she went
With backward footing through the shade a space:
He follow’d, and she turn’d to lead the way
Through aged boughs, that yielded like the mist
Which eagles cleave upmounting from their nest.
Meanwhile in other realms big tears were shed,
More sorrow like to this, and such like woe,
Too huge for mortal tongue or pen of scribe:
The Titans fierce, self-hid, or prison-bound,
Groan’d for the old allegiance once more,
And listen’d in sharp pain for Saturn’s voice.
But one of the whole mammoth-brood still kept
His sov’reignty, and rule, and majesty;—
Blazing Hyperion on his orbed fire
Still sat, still snuff’d the incense, teeming up
From man to the sun’s God; yet unsecure:
For as among us mortals omens drear
Fright and perplex, so also shuddered he—
Not at dog’s howl, or gloom-bird’s hated screech,
Or the familiar visiting of one
Upon the first toll of his passing-bell,
Or prophesyings of the midnight lamp;
But horrors, portion’d to a giant nerve,
Oft made Hyperion ache. His palace bright
Bastion’d with pyramids of glowing gold,
And touch’d with shade of bronzed obelisks,
Glar’d a blood-red through all its thousand courts,
Arches, and domes, and fiery galleries;
And all its curtains of Aurorian clouds
Flush’d angerly: while sometimes eagle’s wings,
Unseen before by Gods or wondering men,
Darken’d the place; and neighing steeds were heard,
Not heard before by Gods or wondering men.
Also, when he would taste the spicy wreaths
Of incense, breath’d aloft from sacred hills,
Instead of sweets, his ample palate took
Savour of poisonous brass and metal sick:
And so, when harbour’d in the sleepy west,
After the full completion of fair day,—
For rest divine upon exalted couch
And slumber in the arms of melody,
He pac’d away the pleasant hours of ease
With stride colossal, on from hall to hall;
While far within each aisle and deep recess,
His winged minions in close clusters stood,
Amaz’d and full of fear; like anxious men
Who on wide plains gather in panting troops,
When earthquakes jar their battlements and towers.
Even now, while Saturn, rous’d from icy trance,
Went step for step with Thea through the woods,
Hyperion, leaving twilight in the rear,
Came slope upon the threshold of the west;
Then, as was wont, his palace-door flew ope
In smoothest silence, save what solemn tubes,
Blown by the serious Zephyrs, gave of sweet
And wandering sounds, slow-breathed melodies;
And like a rose in vermeil tint and shape,
In fragrance soft, and coolness to the eye,
That inlet to severe magnificence
Stood full blown, for the God to enter in.
    He enter’d, but he enter’d full of wrath;
His flaming robes stream’d out beyond his heels,
And gave a roar, as if of earthly fire,
That scar’d away the meek ethereal Hours
And made their dove-wings tremble. On he flared,
From stately nave to nave, from vault to vault,
Through bowers of fragrant and enwreathed light,
And diamond-paved lustrous long arcades,
Until he reach’d the great main cupola;
There standing fierce beneath, he stampt his foot,
And from the basements deep to the high towers
Jarr’d his own golden region; and before
The quavering thunder thereupon had ceas’d,
His voice leapt out, despite of godlike curb,
To this result: “O dreams of day and night!
O monstrous forms! O effigies of pain!
O spectres busy in a cold, cold gloom!
O lank-eared Phantoms of black-weeded pools!
Why do I know ye? why have I seen ye? why
Is my eternal essence thus distraught
To see and to behold these horrors new?
Saturn is fallen, am I too to fall?
Am I to leave this haven of my rest,
This cradle of my glory, this soft clime,
This calm luxuriance of blissful light,
These crystalline pavilions, and pure fanes,
Of all my lucent empire? It is left
Deserted, void, nor any haunt of mine.
The blaze, the splendor, and the symmetry,
I cannot see—but darkness, death and darkness.
Even here, into my centre of repose,
The shady visions come to domineer,
Insult, and blind, and stifle up my pomp.—
Fall!—No, by Tellus and her briny robes!
Over the fiery frontier of my realms
I will advance a terrible right arm
Shall scare that infant thunderer, rebel Jove,
And bid old Saturn take his throne again.”—
He spake, and ceas’d, the while a heavier threat
Held struggle with his throat but came not forth;
For as in theatres of crowded men
Hubbub increases more they call out “Hush!”
So at Hyperion’s words the Phantoms pale
Bestirr’d themselves, thrice horrible and cold;
And from the mirror’d level where he stood
A mist arose, as from a scummy marsh.
At this, through all his bulk an agony
Crept gradual, from the feet unto the crown,
Like a lithe serpent vast and muscular
Making slow way, with head and neck convuls’d
From over-strained might. Releas’d, he fled
To the eastern gates, and full six dewy hours
Before the dawn in season due should blush,
He breath’d fierce breath against the sleepy portals,
Clear’d them of heavy vapours, burst them wide
Suddenly on the ocean’s chilly streams.
The planet orb of fire, whereon he rode
Each day from east to west the heavens through,
Spun round in sable curtaining of clouds;
Not therefore veiled quite, blindfold, and hid,
But ever and anon the glancing spheres,
Circles, and arcs, and broad-belting colure,
Glow’d through, and wrought upon the muffling dark
Sweet-shaped lightnings from the nadir deep
Up to the zenith,—hieroglyphics old,
Which sages and keen-eyed astrologers
Then living on the earth, with labouring thought
Won from the gaze of many centuries:
Now lost, save what we find on remnants huge
Of stone, or marble swart; their import gone,
Their wisdom long since fled.—Two wings this orb
Possess’d for glory, two fair argent wings,
Ever exalted at the God’s approach:
And now, from forth the gloom their plumes immense
Rose, one by one, till all outspreaded were;
While still the dazzling globe maintain’d eclipse,
Awaiting for Hyperion’s command.
Fain would he have commanded, fain took throne
And bid the day begin, if but for change.
He might not:—No, though a primeval God:
The sacred seasons might not be disturb’d.
Therefore the operations of the dawn
Stay’d in their birth, even as here ’tis told.
Those silver wings expanded sisterly,
Eager to sail their orb; the porches wide
Open’d upon the dusk demesnes of night
And the bright Titan, phrenzied with new woes,
Unus’d to bend, by hard compulsion bent
His spirit to the sorrow of the time;
And all along a dismal rack of clouds,
Upon the boundaries of day and night,
He stretch’d himself in grief and radiance faint.
There as he lay, the Heaven with its stars
Look’d down on him with pity, and the voice
Of Cœlus, from the universal space,
Thus whisper’d low and solemn in his ear.
“O brightest of my children dear, earth-born
And sky-engendered, Son of Mysteries
All unrevealed even to the powers
Which met at thy creating; at whose joys
And palpitations sweet, and pleasures soft,
I, Cœlus, wonder, how they came and whence;
And at the fruits thereof what shapes they be,
Distinct, and visible; symbols divine,
Manifestations of that beauteous life
Diffus’d unseen throughout eternal space:
Of these new-form’d art thou, oh brightest child!
Of these, thy brethren and the Goddesses!
There is sad feud among ye, and rebellion
Of son against his sire. I saw him fall,
I saw my first-born tumbled from his throne!
To me his arms were spread, to me his voice
Found way from forth the thunders round his head!
Pale wox I, and in vapours hid my face.
Art thou, too, near such doom? vague fear there is:
For I have seen my sons most unlike Gods.
Divine ye were created, and divine
In sad demeanour, solemn, undisturb’d,
Unruffled, like high Gods, ye liv’d and ruled:
Now I behold in you fear, hope, and wrath;
Actions of rage and passion; even as
I see them, on the mortal world beneath,
In men who die.—This is the grief, O Son!
Sad sign of ruin, sudden dismay, and fall!
Yet do thou strive; as thou art capable,
As thou canst move about, an evident God;
And canst oppose to each malignant hour
Ethereal presence:—I am but a voice;
My life is but the life of winds and tides,
No more than winds and tides can I avail:—
But thou canst.—Be thou therefore in the van
Of circumstance; yea, seize the arrow’s barb
Before the tense string murmur.—To the earth!
For there thou wilt find Saturn, and his woes.
Meantime I will keep watch on thy bright sun,
And of thy seasons be a careful nurse.”—
Ere half this region-whisper had come down,
Hyperion arose, and on the stars
Lifted his curved lids, and kept them wide
Until it ceas’d; and still he kept them wide:
And still they were the same bright, patient stars.
Then with a slow incline of his broad breast,
Like to a diver in the pearly seas,
Forward he stoop’d over the airy shore,
And plung’d all noiseless into the deep night.
Book II
Just at the self-same beat of Time’s wide wings
Hyperion slid into the rustled air,
And Saturn gain’d with Thea that sad place
Where Cybele and the bruised Titans mourn’d.
It was a den where no insulting light
Could glimmer on their tears; where their own groans
They felt, but heard not, for the solid roar
Of thunderous waterfalls and torrents hoarse,
Pouring a constant bulk, uncertain where.
Crag jutting forth to crag, and rocks that seem’d
Ever as if just rising from a sleep,
Forehead to forehead held their monstrous horns;
And thus in thousand hugest phantasies
Made a fit roofing to this nest of woe.
Instead of thrones, hard flint they sat upon,
Couches of rugged stone, and slaty ridge
Stubborn’d with iron. All were not assembled:
Some chain’d in torture, and some wandering.
Cœus, and Gyges, and Briareüs,
Typhon, and Dolor, and Porphyrion,
With many more, the brawniest in assault,
Were pent in regions of laborious breath;
Dungeon’d in opaque element, to keep
Their clenched teeth still clench’d, and all their limbs
Lock’d up like veins of metal, crampt and screw’d;
Without a motion, save of their big hearts
Heaving in pain, and horribly convuls’d
With sanguine feverous boiling gurge of pulse.
Mnemosyne was straying in the world;
Far from her moon had Phœbe wandered;
And many else were free to roam abroad,
But for the main, here found they covert drear.
Scarce images of life, one here, one there,
Lay vast and edgeways; like a dismal cirque
Of Druid stones, upon a forlorn moor,
When the chill rain begins at shut of eve,
In dull November, and their chancel vault,
The Heaven itself, is blinded throughout night.
Each one kept shroud, nor to his neighbour gave
Or word, or look, or action of despair.
Creüs was one; his ponderous iron mace
Lay by him, and a shatter’d rib of rock
Told of his rage, ere he thus sank and pined.
Iäpetus another; in his grasp,
A serpent’s plashy neck; its barbed tongue
Squeez’d from the gorge, and all its uncurl’d length
Dead; and because the creature could not spit
Its poison in the eyes of conquering Jove.
Next Cottus: prone he lay, chin uppermost,
As though in pain; for still upon the flint
He ground severe his skull, with open mouth
And eyes at horrid working. Nearest him
Asia, born of most enormous Caf,
Who cost her mother Tellus keener pangs,
Though feminine, than any of her sons:
More thought than woe was in her dusky face,
For she was prophesying of her glory;
And in her wide imagination stood
Palm-shaded temples, and high rival fanes,
By Oxus or in Ganges’ sacred isles.
Even as Hope upon her anchor leans,
So leant she, not so fair, upon a tusk
Shed from the broadest of her elephants.
Above her, on a crag’s uneasy shelve,
Upon his elbow rais’d, all prostrate else,
Shadow’d Enceladus; once tame and mild
As grazing ox unworried in the meads;
Now tiger-passion’d, lion-thoughted, wroth,
He meditated, plotted, and even now
Was hurling mountains in that second war,
Not long delay’d, that scar’d the younger Gods
To hide themselves in forms of beast and bird.
Not far hence Atlas; and beside him prone
Phorcus, the sire of Gorgons. Neighbour’d close
Oceanus, and Tethys, in whose lap
Sobb’d Clymene among her tangled hair.
In midst of all lay Themis, at the feet
Of Ops the queen all clouded round from sight;
No shape distinguishable, more than when
Thick night confounds the pine-tops with the clouds:
And many else whose names may not be told.
For when the Muse’s wings are air-ward spread,
Who shall delay her flight? And she must chaunt
Of Saturn, and his guide, who now had climb’d
With damp and slippery footing from a depth
More horrid still. Above a sombre cliff
Their heads appear’d, and up their stature grew
Till on the level height their steps found ease:
Then Thea spread abroad her trembling arms
Upon the precincts of this nest of pain,
And sidelong fix’d her eye on Saturn’s face:
There saw she direst strife; the supreme God
At war with all the frailty of grief,
Of rage, of fear, anxiety, revenge,
Remorse, spleen, hope, but most of all despair.
Against these plagues he strove in vain; for Fate
Had pour’d a mortal oil upon his head,
A disanointing poison: so that Thea,
Affrighted, kept her still, and let him pass
First onwards in, among the fallen tribe.
    As with us mortal men, the laden heart
Is persecuted more, and fever’d more,
When it is nighing to the mournful house
Where other hearts are sick of the same bruise;
So Saturn, as he walk’d into the midst,
Felt faint, and would have sunk among the rest,
But that he met Enceladus’s eye,
Whose mightiness, and awe of him, at once
Came like an inspiration; and he shouted,
“Titans, behold your God!” at which some groan’d;
Some started on their feet; some also shouted;
Some wept, some wail’d, all bow’d with reverence;
And Ops, uplifting her black folded veil,
Show’d her pale cheeks, and all her forehead wan,
Her eye-brows thin and jet, and hollow eyes.
There is a roaring in the bleak-grown pines
When Winter lifts his voice; there is a noise
Among immortals when a God gives sign,
With hushing finger, how he means to load
His tongue with the full weight of utterless thought,
With thunder, and with music, and with pomp:
Such noise is like the roar of bleak-grown pines;
Which, when it ceases in this mountain’d world,
No other sound succeeds; but ceasing here,
Among these fallen, Saturn’s voice therefrom
Grew up like organ, that begins anew
Its strain, when other harmonies, stopt short,
Leave the dinn’d air vibrating silverly.
Thus grew it up—“Not in my own sad breast,
Which is its own great judge and searcher out,
Can I find reason why ye should be thus:
Not in the legends of the first of days,
Studied from that old spirit-leaved book
Which starry Uranus with finger bright
Sav’d from the shores of darkness, when the waves
Low-ebb’d still hid it up in shallow gloom;—
And the which book ye know I ever kept
For my firm-based footstool:—Ah, infirm!
Not there, nor in sign, symbol, or portent
Of element, earth, water, air, and fire,—
At war, at peace, or inter-quarreling
One against one, or two, or three, or all
Each several one against the other three,
As fire with air loud warring when rain-floods
Drown both, and press them both against earth’s face,
Where, finding sulphur, a quadruple wrath
Unhinges the poor world;—not in that strife,
Wherefrom I take strange lore, and read it deep,
Can I find reason why ye should be thus:
No, no-where can unriddle, though I search,
And pore on Nature’s universal scroll
Even to swooning, why ye, Divinities,
The first-born of all shap’d and palpable Gods,
Should cower beneath what, in comparison,
Is untremendous might. Yet ye are here,
O’erwhelm’d, and spurn’d, and batter’d, ye are here!
O Titans, shall I say ’Arise!’—Ye groan:
Shall I say ’Crouch!’—Ye groan. What can I then?
O Heaven wide! O unseen parent dear!
What can I? Tell me, all ye brethren Gods,
How we can war, how engine our great wrath!
O speak your counsel now, for Saturn’s ear
Is all a-hunger’d. Thou, Oceanus,
Ponderest high and deep; and in thy face
I see, astonied, that severe content
Which comes of thought and musing: give us help!”
    So ended Saturn; and the God of the Sea,
Sophist and sage, from no Athenian grove,
But cogitation in his watery shades,
Arose, with locks not oozy, and began,
In murmurs, which his first-endeavouring tongue
Caught infant-like from the far-foamed sands.
“O ye, whom wrath consumes! who, passion-stung,
Writhe at defeat, and nurse your agonies!
Shut up your senses, stifle up your ears,
My voice is not a bellows unto ire.
Yet listen, ye who will, whilst I bring proof
How ye, perforce, must be content to stoop:
And in the proof much comfort will I give,
If ye will take that comfort in its truth.
We fall by course of Nature’s law, not force
Of thunder, or of Jove. Great Saturn, thou
Hast sifted well the atom-universe;
But for this reason, that thou art the King,
And only blind from sheer supremacy,
One avenue was shaded from thine eyes,
Through which I wandered to eternal truth.
And first, as thou wast not the first of powers,
So art thou not the last; it cannot be:
Thou art not the beginning nor the end.
From chaos and parental darkness came
Light, the first fruits of that intestine broil,
That sullen ferment, which for wondrous ends
Was ripening in itself. The ripe hour came,
And with it light, and light, engendering
Upon its own producer, forthwith touch’d
The whole enormous matter into life.
Upon that very hour, our parentage,
The Heavens and the Earth, were manifest:
Then thou first-born, and we the giant-race,
Found ourselves ruling new and beauteous realms.
Now comes the pain of truth, to whom ’tis pain;
O folly! for to bear all naked truths,
And to envisage circumstance, all calm,
That is the top of sovereignty. Mark well!
As Heaven and Earth are fairer, fairer far
Than Chaos and blank Darkness, though once chiefs;
And as we show beyond that Heaven and Earth
In form and shape compact and beautiful,
In will, in action free, companionship,
And thousand other signs of purer life;
So on our heels a fresh perfection treads,
A power more strong in beauty, born of us
And fated to excel us, as we pass
In glory that old Darkness: nor are we
Thereby more conquer’d, than by us the rule
Of shapeless Chaos. Say, doth the dull soil
Quarrel with the proud forests it hath fed,
And feedeth still, more comely than itself?
Can it deny the chiefdom of green groves?
Or shall the tree be envious of the dove
Because it cooeth, and hath snowy wings
To wander wherewithal and find its joys?
We are such forest-trees, and our fair boughs
Have bred forth, not pale solitary doves,
But eagles golden-feather’d, who do tower
Above us in their beauty, and must reign
In right thereof; for ’tis the eternal law
That first in beauty should be first in might:
Yea, by that law, another race may drive
Our conquerors to mourn as we do now.
Have ye beheld the young God of the Seas,
My dispossessor? Have ye seen his face?
Have ye beheld his chariot, foam’d along
By noble winged creatures he hath made?
I saw him on the calmed waters scud,
With such a glow of beauty in his eyes,
That it enforc’d me to bid sad farewell
To all my empire: farewell sad I took,
And hither came, to see how dolorous fate
Had wrought upon ye; and how I might best
Give consolation in this woe extreme.
Receive the truth, and let it be your balm.”
    Whether through poz’d conviction, or disdain,
They guarded silence, when Oceanus
Left murmuring, what deepest thought can tell?
But so it was, none answer’d for a space,
Save one whom none regarded, Clymene;
And yet she answer’d not, only complain’d,
With hectic lips, and eyes up-looking mild,
Thus wording timidly among the fierce:
“O Father, I am here the simplest voice,
And all my knowledge is that joy is gone,
And this thing woe crept in among our hearts,
There to remain for ever, as I fear:
I would not bode of evil, if I thought
So weak a creature could turn off the help
Which by just right should come of mighty Gods;
Yet let me tell my sorrow, let me tell
Of what I heard, and how it made me weep,
And know that we had parted from all hope.
I stood upon a shore, a pleasant shore,
Where a sweet clime was breathed from a land
Of fragrance, quietness, and trees, and flowers.
Full of calm joy it was, as I of grief;
Too full of joy and soft delicious warmth;
So that I felt a movement in my heart
To chide, and to reproach that solitude
With songs of misery, music of our woes;
And sat me down, and took a mouthed shell
And murmur’d into it, and made melody—
O melody no more! for while I sang,
And with poor skill let pass into the breeze
The dull shell’s echo, from a bowery strand
Just opposite, an island of the sea,
There came enchantment with the shifting wind,
That did both drown and keep alive my ears.
I threw my shell away upon the sand,
And a wave fill’d it, as my sense was fill’d
With that new blissful golden melody.
A living death was in each gush of sounds,
Each family of rapturous hurried notes,
That fell, one after one, yet all at once,
Like pearl beads dropping sudden from their string:
And then another, then another strain,
Each like a dove leaving its olive perch,
With music wing’d instead of silent plumes,
To hover round my head, and make me sick
Of joy and grief at once. Grief overcame,
And I was stopping up my frantic ears,
When, past all hindrance of my trembling hands,
A voice came sweeter, sweeter than all tune,
And still it cried, ’Apollo! young Apollo!
The morning-bright Apollo! young Apollo!’
I fled, it follow’d me, and cried ’Apollo!’
O Father, and O Brethren, had ye felt
Those pains of mine; O Saturn, hadst thou felt,
Ye would not call this too indulged tongue
Presumptuous, in thus venturing to be heard.”
    So far her voice flow’d on, like timorous brook
That, lingering along a pebbled coast,
Doth fear to meet the sea: but sea it met,
And shudder’d; for the overwhelming voice
Of huge Enceladus swallow’d it in wrath:
The ponderous syllables, like sullen waves
In the half-glutted hollows of reef-rocks,
Came booming thus, while still upon his arm
He lean’d; not rising, from supreme contempt.
“Or shall we listen to the over-wise,
Or to the over-foolish, Giant-Gods?
Not thunderbolt on thunderbolt, till all
That rebel Jove’s whole armoury were spent,
Not world on world upon these shoulders piled,
Could agonize me more than baby-words
In midst of this dethronement horrible.
Speak! roar! shout! yell! ye sleepy Titans all.
Do ye forget the blows, the buffets vile?
Are ye not smitten by a youngling arm?
Dost thou forget, sham Monarch of the Waves,
Thy scalding in the seas? What, have I rous’d
Your spleens with so few simple words as these?
O joy! for now I see ye are not lost:
O joy! for now I see a thousand eyes
Wide glaring for revenge!”—As this he said,
He lifted up his stature vast, and stood,
Still without intermission speaking thus:
“Now ye are flames, I’ll tell you how to burn,
And purge the ether of our enemies;
How to feed fierce the crooked stings of fire,
And singe away the swollen clouds of Jove,
Stifling that puny essence in its tent.
O let him feel the evil he hath done;
For though I scorn Oceanus’s lore,
Much pain have I for more than loss of realms:
The days of peace and slumberous calm are fled;
Those days, all innocent of scathing war,
When all the fair Existences of heaven
Came open-eyed to guess what we would speak:—
That was before our brows were taught to frown,
Before our lips knew else but solemn sounds;
That was before we knew the winged thing,
Victory, might be lost, or might be won.
And be ye mindful that Hyperion,
Our brightest brother, still is undisgraced—
Hyperion, lo! his radiance is here!”
    All eyes were on Enceladus’s face,
And they beheld, while still Hyperion’s name
Flew from his lips up to the vaulted rocks,
A pallid gleam across his features stern:
Not savage, for he saw full many a God
Wroth as himself. He look’d upon them all,
And in each face he saw a gleam of light,
But splendider in Saturn’s, whose hoar locks
Shone like the bubbling foam about a keel
When the prow sweeps into a midnight cove.
In pale and silver silence they remain’d,
Till suddenly a splendour, like the morn,
Pervaded all the beetling gloomy steeps,
All the sad spaces of oblivion,
And every gulf, and every chasm old,
And every height, and every sullen depth,
Voiceless, or hoarse with loud tormented streams:
And all the everlasting cataracts,
And all the headlong torrents far and near,
Mantled before in darkness and huge shade,
Now saw the light and made it terrible.
It was Hyperion:—a granite peak
His bright feet touch’d, and there he stay’d to view
The misery his brilliance had betray’d
To the most hateful seeing of itself.
Golden his hair of short Numidian curl,
Regal his shape majestic, a vast shade
In midst of his own brightness, like the bulk
Of Memnon’s image at the set of sun
To one who travels from the dusking East:
Sighs, too, as mournful as that Memnon’s harp
He utter’d, while his hands contemplative
He press’d together, and in silence stood.
Despondence seiz’d again the fallen Gods
At sight of the dejected King of Day,
And many hid their faces from the light:
But fierce Enceladus sent forth his eyes
Among the brotherhood; and, at their glare,
Uprose Iäpetus, and Creüs too,
And Phorcus, sea-born, and together strode
To where he towered on his eminence.
There those four shouted forth old Saturn’s name;
Hyperion from the peak loud answered, “Saturn!”
Saturn sat near the Mother of the Gods,
In whose face was no joy, though all the Gods
Gave from their hollow throats the name of “Saturn!”
Book III
Thus in alternate uproar and sad peace,
Amazed were those Titans utterly.
O leave them, Muse! O leave them to their woes;
For thou art weak to sing such tumults dire:
A solitary sorrow best befits
Thy lips, and antheming a lonely grief.
Leave them, O Muse! for thou anon wilt find
Many a fallen old Divinity
Wandering in vain about bewildered shores.
Meantime touch piously the Delphic harp,
And not a wind of heaven but will breathe
In aid soft warble from the Dorian flute;
For lo! ’tis for the Father of all verse.
Flush every thing that hath a vermeil hue,
Let the rose glow intense and warm the air,
And let the clouds of even and of morn
Float in voluptuous fleeces o’er the hills;
Let the red wine within the goblet boil,
Cold as a bubbling well; let faint-lipp’d shells,
On sands, or in great deeps, vermilion turn
Through all their labyrinths; and let the maid
Blush keenly, as with some warm kiss surpris’d.
Chief isle of the embowered Cyclades,
Rejoice, O Delos, with thine olives green,
And poplars, and lawn-shading palms, and beech,
In which the Zephyr breathes the loudest song,
And hazels thick, dark-stemm’d beneath the shade:
Apollo is once more the golden theme!
Where was he, when the Giant of the Sun
Stood bright, amid the sorrow of his peers?
Together had he left his mother fair
And his twin-sister sleeping in their bower,
And in the morning twilight wandered forth
Beside the osiers of a rivulet,
Full ankle-deep in lilies of the vale.
The nightingale had ceas’d, and a few stars
Were lingering in the heavens, while the thrush
Began calm-throated. Throughout all the isle
There was no covert, no retired cave
Unhaunted by the murmurous noise of waves,
Though scarcely heard in many a green recess.
He listen’d, and he wept, and his bright tears
Went trickling down the golden bow he held.
Thus with half-shut suffused eyes he stood,
While from beneath some cumbrous boughs hard by
With solemn step an awful Goddess came,
And there was purport in her looks for him,
Which he with eager guess began to read
Perplex’d, the while melodiously he said:
“How cam’st thou over the unfooted sea?
Or hath that antique mien and robed form
Mov’d in these vales invisible till now?
Sure I have heard those vestments sweeping o’er
The fallen leaves, when I have sat alone
In cool mid-forest. Surely I have traced
The rustle of those ample skirts about
These grassy solitudes, and seen the flowers
Lift up their heads, as still the whisper pass’d.
Goddess! I have beheld those eyes before,
And their eternal calm, and all that face,
Or I have dream’d.”—“Yes,” said the supreme shape,
“Thou hast dream’d of me; and awaking up
Didst find a lyre all golden by thy side,
Whose strings touch’d by thy fingers, all the vast
Unwearied ear of the whole universe
Listen’d in pain and pleasure at the birth
Of such new tuneful wonder. Is’t not strange
That thou shouldst weep, so gifted? Tell me, youth,
What sorrow thou canst feel; for I am sad
When thou dost shed a tear: explain thy griefs
To one who in this lonely isle hath been
The watcher of thy sleep and hours of life,
From the young day when first thy infant hand
Pluck’d witless the weak flowers, till thine arm
Could bend that bow heroic to all times.
Show thy heart’s secret to an ancient Power
Who hath forsaken old and sacred thrones
For prophecies of thee, and for the sake
Of loveliness new born.”—Apollo then,
With sudden scrutiny and gloomless eyes,
Thus answer’d, while his white melodious throat
Throbb’d with the syllables.—“Mnemosyne!
Thy name is on my tongue, I know not how;
Why should I tell thee what thou so well seest?
Why should I strive to show what from thy lips
Would come no mystery? For me, dark, dark,
And painful vile oblivion seals my eyes:
I strive to search wherefore I am so sad,
Until a melancholy numbs my limbs;
And then upon the grass I sit, and moan,
Like one who once had wings.—O why should I
Feel curs’d and thwarted, when the liegeless air
Yields to my step aspirant? why should I
Spurn the green turf as hateful to my feet?
Goddess benign, point forth some unknown thing:
Are there not other regions than this isle?
What are the stars? There is the sun, the sun!
And the most patient brilliance of the moon!
And stars by thousands! Point me out the way
To any one particular beauteous star,
And I will flit into it with my lyre,
And make its silvery splendour pant with bliss.
I have heard the cloudy thunder: Where is power?
Whose hand, whose essence, what divinity
Makes this alarum in the elements,
While I here idle listen on the shores
In fearless yet in aching ignorance?
O tell me, lonely Goddess, by thy harp,
That waileth every morn and eventide,
Tell me why thus I rave, about these groves!
Mute thou remainest—Mute! yet I can read
A wondrous lesson in thy silent face:
Knowledge enormous makes a God of me.
Names, deeds, gray legends, dire events, rebellions,
Majesties, sovran voices, agonies,
Creations and destroyings, all at once
Pour into the wide hollows of my brain,
And deify me, as if some blithe wine
Or bright elixir peerless I had drunk,
And so become immortal.“—Thus the God,
While his enkindled eyes, with level glance
Beneath his white soft temples, stedfast kept
Trembling with light upon Mnemosyne.
Soon wild commotions shook him, and made flush
All the immortal fairness of his limbs;
Most like the struggle at the gate of death;
Or liker still to one who should take leave
Of pale immortal death, and with a pang
As hot as death’s is chill, with fierce convulse
Die into life: so young Apollo anguish’d:
His very hair, his golden tresses famed
Kept undulation round his eager neck.
During the pain Mnemosyne upheld
Her arms as one who prophesied.—At length
Apollo shriek’d;—and lo! from all his limbs
Celestial"
"When Puffy says, and we won’ t stop, 'cause we can’ t stop.","I think of a good night’s sleep
an exhale taking its precious time
to leave my lungs         unworried
about the breathing to come       If only
I did not hail from the sweet state
of panic                               the town’s river,
my adrenaline raging without cease
I’d love peace but the moon is pulling me by my water
I know this is no way to live     but I was born here
a mobile of vultures orbiting above my crib
the noise you speak      bragging
about the luxury of your stillness
reminds me that some children are told to pick flowers
while others are told to pick a tree switch
that’ll best write a lesson across their hide
and my skin is a master course written in welts
I touch myself and read about the years
I cannot escape                              I hold my kids
and pray our embrace is not a history
repeating itself"
Ode on Melancholy,"1.
No, no, go not to Lethe, neither twist
       Wolf's-bane, tight-rooted, for its poisonous wine;
Nor suffer thy pale forehead to be kiss'd
       By nightshade, ruby grape of Proserpine;
Make not your rosary of yew-berries,
       Nor let the beetle, nor the death-moth be
               Your mournful Psyche, nor the downy owl
A partner in your sorrow's mysteries;
       For shade to shade will come too drowsily,
               And drown the wakeful anguish of the soul.
2.
But when the melancholy fit shall fall
       Sudden from heaven like a weeping cloud,
That fosters the droop-headed flowers all,
       And hides the green hill in an April shroud;
Then glut thy sorrow on a morning rose,
       Or on the rainbow of the salt sand-wave,
               Or on the wealth of globed peonies;
Or if thy mistress some rich anger shows,
       Emprison her soft hand, and let her rave,
               And feed deep, deep upon her peerless eyes.
3.
She dwells with Beauty—Beauty that must die;
       And Joy, whose hand is ever at his lips
Bidding adieu; and aching Pleasure nigh,
       Turning to poison while the bee-mouth sips:
Ay, in the very temple of Delight
       Veil'd Melancholy has her sovran shrine,
              Though seen of none save him whose strenuous tongue
Can burst Joy's grape against his palate fine;
       His soul shalt taste the sadness of her might,
              And be among her cloudy trophies hung."
a brief meditation on breath,"i have diver’s lungs from holding my
breath for so long. i promise you
i am not trying to break a record
sometimes i just forget to
exhale. my shoulders held tightly
near my neck, i am a ball of tense
living, a tumbleweed with steel-toed
boots. i can’t remember the last time
i felt light as dandelion. i can’t remember
the last time i took the sweetness in
& my diaphragm expanded into song.
they tell me breathing is everything,
meaning if i breathe right i can live to be
ancient. i’ll grow a soft furry tail or be
telekinetic something powerful enough
to heal the world. i swear i thought
the last time i’d think of death with breath
was that balmy day in july when the cops
became a raging fire & sucked the breath
out of Garner; but yesterday i walked
38 blocks to my father’s house with a mask
over my nose & mouth, the sweat dripping
off my chin only to get caught in fabric & pool up
like rain. & i inhaled small spurts of me, little
particles of my dna. i took into body my own self
& thought i’d die from so much exposure
to my own bereavement—they’re saying
this virus takes your breath away, not
like a mother’s love or like a good kiss
from your lover’s soft mouth but like the police
it can kill you fast or slow; dealer’s choice.
a pallbearer carrying your body without a casket.
they say it’s so contagious it could be quite
breathtaking. so persistent it might as well
be breathing                        down your neck—"
Assume the Position,"The train came with a police officer
on his gun. He shifts his weight
against the door. A flash back loads
the first time a service weapon was pulled in my face;
the second time it made me lay on the ground;
the third time it put my hands in the air; the fourth time
it pushed me against a wall; the fifth time
it told me it was just doing its job; the sixth time
it kicked my feet apart; the seventh time
it followed me home; the eighth time it grabbed my shirt collar.
Read the signs: it’s illegal to move
between cars.
Read the signs; my body knows
how Klan-rally a cop’s gun feels at eye level.
The ninth time the barrel cocked its head;
the tenth time, it told me it missed me
the last time; it said, burning black bodies is a tradition
it was raised on; the eleventh time the safety and trigger argued
through a range of black fiction. I could’ve been
any made-up one of us: Ricky or Wee-Bey
Mad Max or Tray; we all look the same under the right racism
anyway; the twelfth time it dared me to swing; the thirteenth time
I thought about it; the fourteenth time, I almost did it;
the fifteenth time, there were no cellphones; the sixteenth time
just covered badges; the seventeenth time
it searched me for the broken laws it thought I was;
the eighteenth time I assumed the position without anything
being said."
