A Line-storm Song,"The line-storm clouds fly tattered and swift, 
  The road is forlorn all day, 
Where a myriad snowy quartz stones lift, 
  And the hoof-prints vanish away. 
The roadside flowers, too wet for the bee,
  Expend their bloom in vain. 
Come over the hills and far with me, 
  And be my love in the rain. 
The birds have less to say for themselves 
  In the wood-world’s torn despair
Than now these numberless years the elves, 
  Although they are no less there: 
All song of the woods is crushed like some 
  Wild, easily shattered rose. 
Come, be my love in the wet woods; come,
  Where the boughs rain when it blows. 
There is the gale to urge behind 
  And bruit our singing down, 
And the shallow waters aflutter with wind 
  From which to gather your gown.    
What matter if we go clear to the west, 
  And come not through dry-shod? 
For wilding brooch shall wet your breast 
  The rain-fresh goldenrod. 
Oh, never this whelming east wind swells   
  But it seems like the sea’s return 
To the ancient lands where it left the shells 
  Before the age of the fern; 
And it seems like the time when after doubt 
  Our love came back amain.      
Oh, come forth into the storm and rout 
  And be my love in the rain.",The poem is set in the rain-soaked woods of northern England. It is the story of a love affair between a man and a woman in the woods.
The Weary Blues,"Droning a drowsy syncopated tune,
Rocking back and forth to a mellow croon,
     I heard a Negro play.
Down on Lenox Avenue the other night
By the pale dull pallor of an old gas light
     He did a lazy sway . . .
     He did a lazy sway . . .
To the tune o’ those Weary Blues.
With his ebony hands on each ivory key
He made that poor piano moan with melody.
     O Blues!
Swaying to and fro on his rickety stool
He played that sad raggy tune like a musical fool.
     Sweet Blues!
Coming from a black man’s soul.
     O Blues!
In a deep song voice with a melancholy tone
I heard that Negro sing, that old piano moan—
     ""Ain’t got nobody in all this world,
       Ain’t got nobody but ma self.
       I’s gwine to quit ma frownin’
       And put ma troubles on the shelf.""
Thump, thump, thump, went his foot on the floor.
He played a few chords then he sang some more—
     ""I got the Weary Blues
       And I can’t be satisfied.
       Got the Weary Blues
       And can’t be satisfied—
       I ain’t happy no mo’
       And I wish that I had died.""
And far into the night he crooned that tune.
The stars went out and so did the moon.
The singer stopped playing and went to bed
While the Weary Blues echoed through his head.
He slept like a rock or a man that's dead.","I heard a Negro play. Droning a drowsy syncopated tune, rocking back and forth to a mellow croon. ""Ain’t got nobody in all this world, but ma self,"" he sang."
Morning in the Burned House,"In the burned house I am eating breakfast.
You understand: there is no house, there is no breakfast,
yet here I am.
The spoon which was melted scrapes against
the bowl which was melted also.
No one else is around.
Where have they gone to, brother and sister,
mother and father? Off along the shore,
perhaps. Their clothes are still on the hangers,
their dishes piled beside the sink,
which is beside the woodstove
with its grate and sooty kettle,
every detail clear,
tin cup and rippled mirror.
The day is bright and songless,
the lake is blue, the forest watchful.
In the east a bank of cloud
rises up silently like dark bread.
I can see the swirls in the oilcloth,
I can see the flaws in the glass,
those flares where the sun hits them.
I can't see my own arms and legs
or know if this is a trap or blessing,
finding myself back here, where everything
in this house has long been over,
kettle and mirror, spoon and bowl,
including my own body,
including the body I had then,
including the body I have now
as I sit at this morning table, alone and happy,
bare child's feet on the scorched floorboards
(I can almost see)
in my burning clothes, the thin green shorts
and grubby yellow T-shirt
holding my cindery, non-existent,
radiant flesh. Incandescent.","In the burned house I am eating breakfast. There is no house, there is no breakfast, yet here I am. I can't see my own arms and legs. I don't know if this is a trap or blessing."
On Living,"I
Living is no laughing matter:
 you must live with great seriousness
  like a squirrel, for example—
   I mean without looking for something beyond and above living,
  I mean living must be your whole occupation.
Living is no laughing matter:
 you must take it seriously,
 so much so and to such a degree
   that, for example, your hands tied behind your back,
                                            your back to the wall,
   or else in a laboratory
 in your white coat and safety glasses,
 you can die for people—
   even for people whose faces you’ve never seen,
   even though you know living
 is the most real, the most beautiful thing.
I mean, you must take living so seriously
   that even at seventy, for example, you’ll plant olive trees—
   and not for your children, either,
   but because although you fear death you don’t believe it,
   because living, I mean, weighs heavier.
II
Let’s say we’re seriously ill, need surgery—
which is to say we might not get up
   from the white table.
Even though it’s impossible not to feel sad
   about going a little too soon,
we’ll still laugh at the jokes being told,
we’ll look out the window to see if it’s raining,
or still wait anxiously
  for the latest newscast. . . 
Let’s say we’re at the front—
 for something worth fighting for, say.
There, in the first offensive, on that very day,
 we might fall on our face, dead.
We’ll know this with a curious anger,
        but we’ll still worry ourselves to death
        about the outcome of the war, which could last years.
Let’s say we’re in prison
and close to fifty,
and we have eighteen more years, say,
                        before the iron doors will open.
We’ll still live with the outside,
with its people and animals, struggle and wind—
                                I  mean with the outside beyond the walls.
I mean, however and wherever we are,
        we must live as if we will never die.
III
This earth will grow cold,
a star among stars
               and one of the smallest,
a gilded mote on blue velvet—
   I mean this, our great earth.
This earth will grow cold one day,
not like a block of ice
or a dead cloud even 
but like an empty walnut it will roll along
   in pitch-black space . . . 
You must grieve for this right now
—you have to feel this sorrow now—
for the world must be loved this much
                               if you’re going to say “I lived”. . .","Living is no laughing matter: you must take it seriously, so much so and to such a degree that, for example, your hands are tied behind your back. You can die for people, even for people whose faces you’ve never seen, even though you know living is the most real, the most beautiful thing."
I Could Be a Whale Shark,"                     Bolinao, Philippines
 I am worried about tentacles.
How you can still get stung
even if the jelly arm disconnects
from the bell. My husband
swims without me—farther
out to sea than I would like,
buoyed by salt and rind of kelp.
I am worried if I step too far
into the China Sea, my baby
will slow the beautiful kicks
he has just begun since we landed.
The quickening, they call it, 
but all I am is slow, a moon jelly
floating like a bag in the sea.
Or a whale shark. Yes—I could be
a whale shark, newly spotted
with moles from the pregnancy—
my wide mouth always open
to eat and eat with a look that says
Surprise! Did I eat that much?
When I sleep, I am a flutefish,
just lying there, swaying back
and forth among the kelpy mess
of sheets. You can see the wet
of my dark eye awake, awake. 
My husband is a pale blur 
near the horizon, full of adobo
and not waiting thirty minutes 
before swimming. He is free
and waves at me as he backstrokes
past. This is how he prepares
for fatherhood. Such tenderness
still lingers in the air: the Roman
poet Virgil gave his pet fly
the most lavish funeral, complete
with meat feast and barrels 
of oaky wine. You can never know
where or why you hear
a humming on this soft earth.

"Batter my heart, three person'd God (Holy Sonnet 14)","Batter my heart, three-personed God, for you
As yet but knock, breathe, shine, and seek to mend;
That I may rise, and stand, o'erthrow me, and bend
Your force to break, blow, burn, and make me new.
I, like an usurped town, to another due,
Labour to admit you, but Oh, to no end.
Reason, your viceroy in me, me should defend,
But is captived, and proves weak or untrue.
Yet dearly I love you, and would be loved fain,
But am betrothed unto your enemy:
Divorce me, untie or break that knot again,

Nor ever chaste, except you ravish me.","""Batter my heart, three-personed God, for you yet but knock, breathe, shine, and seek to mend"" ""Yet dearly I love you, and would be loved fain, but am betrothed unto your enemy"" ""Divorce me, untie or break that knot again"""
Theme for English B,"The instructor said,
    Go home and write
    a page tonight.
    And let that page come out of you—
    Then, it will be true.
I wonder if it's that simple?
I am twenty-two, colored, born in Winston-Salem.
I went to school there, then Durham, then here
to this college on the hill above Harlem.
I am the only colored student in my class.
The steps from the hill lead down into Harlem,
through a park, then I cross St. Nicholas,
Eighth Avenue, Seventh, and I come to the Y,
the Harlem Branch Y, where I take the elevator
up to my room, sit down, and write this page:
It's not easy to know what is true for you or me
at twenty-two, my age. But I guess I'm what
I feel and see and hear, Harlem, I hear you:
hear you, hear me—we two—you, me, talk on this page.
(I hear New York, too.) Me—who?
Well, I like to eat, sleep, drink, and be in love.
I like to work, read, learn, and understand life.
I like a pipe for a Christmas present,
or records—Bessie, bop, or Bach.
I guess being colored doesn't make me not like
the same things other folks like who are other races.
So will my page be colored that I write?
Being me, it will not be white.
But it will be
a part of you, instructor.
You are white—
yet a part of me, as I am a part of you.
That's American.
Sometimes perhaps you don't want to be a part of me.
Nor do I often want to be a part of you.
But we are, that's true!
As I learn from you,
I guess you learn from me—
although you're older—and white—
and somewhat more free.
This is my page for English B.","The author is a colored student at a college in Harlem, New York City. He writes about his experiences at school and at the YMCA. ""I like to work, read, learn, and understand life,"" he writes."
The Negro Speaks of Rivers,"I've known rivers:
I've known rivers ancient as the world and older than the
     flow of human blood in human veins.
My soul has grown deep like the rivers.
I bathed in the Euphrates when dawns were young.
I built my hut near the Congo and it lulled me to sleep.
I looked upon the Nile and raised the pyramids above it.
I heard the singing of the Mississippi when Abe Lincoln
     went down to New Orleans, and I've seen its muddy
     bosom turn all golden in the sunset.

Poem [Lana Turner has collapsed!],"Lana Turner has collapsed!
I was trotting along and suddenly
it started raining and snowing
and you said it was hailing
but hailing hits you on the head
hard so it was really snowing and
raining and I was in such a hurry
to meet you but the traffic
was acting exactly like the sky
and suddenly I see a headline
LANA TURNER HAS COLLAPSED!
there is no snow in Hollywood
there is no rain in California
I have been to lots of parties
and acted perfectly disgraceful
but I never actually collapsed
oh Lana Turner we love you get up",Lana Turner has collapsed! is the headline of the front page of this week's issue of The Sun. The headline reads: Lana Turner has collapse! The story is based on a true story.
Dream Variations,"To fling my arms wide
In some place of the sun,
To whirl and to dance
Till the white day is done.
Then rest at cool evening
Beneath a tall tree
While night comes on gently,
    Dark like me—
That is my dream!
To fling my arms wide
In the face of the sun,
Dance! Whirl! Whirl!
Till the quick day is done.
Rest at pale evening . . .

In the Waiting Room,"In Worcester, Massachusetts,
I went with Aunt Consuelo
to keep her dentist's appointment
and sat and waited for her
in the dentist's waiting room.
It was winter. It got dark
early. The waiting room
was full of grown-up people,
arctics and overcoats,
lamps and magazines.
My aunt was inside
what seemed like a long time
and while I waited I read
the National Geographic
(I could read) and carefully
studied the photographs:
the inside of a volcano,
black, and full of ashes;
then it was spilling over
in rivulets of fire.
Osa and Martin Johnson
dressed in riding breeches,
laced boots, and pith helmets.
A dead man slung on a pole
--""Long Pig,"" the caption said.
Babies with pointed heads
wound round and round with string;
black, naked women with necks
wound round and round with wire
like the necks of light bulbs.
Their breasts were horrifying.
I read it right straight through.
I was too shy to stop.
And then I looked at the cover:
the yellow margins, the date.
Suddenly, from inside,
came an oh! of pain
--Aunt Consuelo's voice--
not very loud or long.
I wasn't at all surprised;
even then I knew she was
a foolish, timid woman.
I might have been embarrassed,
but wasn't. What took me
completely by surprise
was that it was me:
my voice, in my mouth.
Without thinking at all
I was my foolish aunt,
I--we--were falling, falling,
our eyes glued to the cover
of the National Geographic,
February, 1918.
I said to myself: three days
and you'll be seven years old.
I was saying it to stop
the sensation of falling off
the round, turning world.
into cold, blue-black space.
But I felt: you are an I,
you are an Elizabeth,
you are one of them.
Why should you be one, too?
I scarcely dared to look
to see what it was I was.
I gave a sidelong glance
--I couldn't look any higher--
at shadowy gray knees,
trousers and skirts and boots
and different pairs of hands
lying under the lamps.
I knew that nothing stranger
had ever happened, that nothing
stranger could ever happen.
Why should I be my aunt,
or me, or anyone?
What similarities--
boots, hands, the family voice
I felt in my throat, or even
the National Geographic
and those awful hanging breasts--
held us all together
or made us all just one?
How--I didn't know any
word for it--how ""unlikely"". . .
How had I come to be here,
like them, and overhear
a cry of pain that could have
got loud and worse but hadn't?
The waiting room was bright
and too hot. It was sliding
beneath a big black wave,
another, and another.
Then I was back in it.
The War was on. Outside,
in Worcester, Massachusetts,
were night and slush and cold,
and it was still the fifth
of February, 1918.","In Worcester, Massachusetts, in February, 1918, Elizabeth was seven years old. She was with her aunt, Consuelo, at her dentist's appointment.

Haunted Houses,"All houses wherein men have lived and died
Are haunted houses. Through the open doors
The harmless phantoms on their errands glide,
With feet that make no sound upon the floors.
We meet them at the door-way, on the stair,
Along the passages they come and go,
Impalpable impressions on the air,
A sense of something moving to and fro.
There are more guests at table than the hosts
Invited; the illuminated hall
Is thronged with quiet, inoffensive ghosts,
As silent as the pictures on the wall.
The stranger at my fireside cannot see
The forms I see, nor hear the sounds I hear;
He but perceives what is; while unto me
All that has been is visible and clear.
We have no title-deeds to house or lands;
Owners and occupants of earlier dates
From graves forgotten stretch their dusty hands,
And hold in mortmain still their old estates.
The spirit-world around this world of sense
Floats like an atmosphere, and everywhere
Wafts through these earthly mists and vapours dense
A vital breath of more ethereal air.
Our little lives are kept in equipoise
By opposite attractions and desires;
The struggle of the instinct that enjoys,
And the more noble instinct that aspires.
These perturbations, this perpetual jar
Of earthly wants and aspirations high,
Come from the influence of an unseen star
An undiscovered planet in our sky.
And as the moon from some dark gate of cloud
Throws o’er the sea a floating bridge of light,
Across whose trembling planks our fancies crowd
Into the realm of mystery and night,—
So from the world of spirits there descends
A bridge of light, connecting it with this,
O'er whose unsteady floor, that sways and bends,
Wander our thoughts above the dark abyss.","All houses wherein men have lived and died are haunted houses. Through the open doors the harmless phantoms on their errands glide. The stranger at my fireside cannot see the forms I see, nor hear the sounds I hear."
The moon rose over the bay. I had a lot of feelings.,"I am taken with the hot animal
of my skin, grateful to swing my limbs
and have them move as I intend, though
my knee, though my shoulder, though something
is torn or tearing. Today, a dozen squid, dead
on the harbor beach: one mostly buried,
one with skin empty as a shell and hollow
feeling, and, though the tentacles look soft,
I do not touch them. I imagine they
were startled to find themselves in the sun.
I imagine the tide simply went out
without them. I imagine they cannot
feel the black flies charting the raised hills
of their eyes. I write my name in the sand:
Donika Kelly. I watch eighteen seagulls
skim the sandbar and lift low in the sky.
I pick up a pebble that looks like a green egg.
To the ditch lily I say I am in love.
To the Jeep parked haphazardly on the narrow
street I am in love. To the roses, white
petals rimmed brown, to the yellow lined
pavement, to the house trimmed in gold I am
in love. I shout with the rough calculus
of walking. Just let me find my way back,
let me move like a tide come in.","Donika Kelly writes about her love of the beach and the people around her. Kelly writes: ""I am taken with the hot animal                of my skin"""
Christmas Bells,"I heard the bells on Christmas Day
Their old, familiar carols play,
    And wild and sweet
    The words repeat
Of peace on earth, good-will to men!
And thought how, as the day had come,
The belfries of all Christendom
    Had rolled along
    The unbroken song
Of peace on earth, good-will to men!
Till ringing, singing on its way,
The world revolved from night to day,
    A voice, a chime,
    A chant sublime
Of peace on earth, good-will to men!
Then from each black, accursed mouth
The cannon thundered in the South,
    And with the sound
    The carols drowned
Of peace on earth, good-will to men!
It was as if an earthquake rent
The hearth-stones of a continent,
    And made forlorn
    The households born
Of peace on earth, good-will to men!
And in despair I bowed my head;
""There is no peace on earth,"" I said;
    ""For hate is strong,
    And mocks the song
Of peace on earth, good-will to men!""
Then pealed the bells more loud and deep:
""God is not dead, nor doth He sleep;
    The Wrong shall fail,
    The Right prevail,
With peace on earth, good-will to men.""","I heard the bells on Christmas Day and thought how, as the day had come, the belfries of all Christendom had rolled along with the unbroken song of peace on earth. The cannon thundered in the South and with the sound the carols drowned out the song."
Mr. Macklin’s Jack O’Lantern,"Mr. Macklin takes his knife 
And carves the yellow pumpkin face: 
Three holes bring eyes and nose to life, 
The mouth has thirteen teeth in place. 
Then Mr. Macklin just for fun 
Transfers the corn-cob pipe from his 
Wry mouth to Jack’s, and everyone 
Dies laughing! O what fun it is 
Till Mr. Macklin draws the shade 
And lights the candle in Jack’s skull. 
Then all the inside dark is made 
As spooky and as horrorful 
As Halloween, and creepy crawl 
The shadows on the tool-house floor, 
With Jack’s face dancing on the wall. 
O Mr. Macklin! where's the door?","Mr. Macklin takes his knife  and carves the yellow pumpkin face:                 Three holes bring eyes and nose to life,                 The mouth has thirteen teeth in place."
One Sister have I in our house (14),"One Sister have I in our house - 
And one a hedge away. 
There's only one recorded, 
But both belong to me. 
  
One came the way that I came -         
And wore my past year's gown - 
The other as a bird her nest, 
Builded our hearts among. 
  
She did not sing as we did - 
It was a different tune -     
Herself to her a Music 
As Bumble-bee of June. 
  
Today is far from Childhood -
But up and down the hills 
I held her hand the tighter -         
Which shortened all the miles - 
  
And still her hum 
The years among, 
Deceives the Butterfly; 
Still in her Eye 
The Violets lie 
Mouldered this many May.         
  
I spilt the dew -
But took the morn, - 
I chose this single star 
From out the wide night's numbers - 
Sue - forevermore!","One came the way that I came. The other as a bird her nest,                 Builded our hearts among. One Sister have I in our house -                 And one a hedge away."
Thanksgiving Day,"Over the river, and through the wood,
  To grandfather's house we go;
       The horse knows the way
       To carry the sleigh
  Through the white and drifted snow.
Over the river, and through the wood—
  Oh, how the wind does blow!
       It stings the toes
       And bites the nose
  As over the ground we go.
Over the river, and through the wood,
  To have a first-rate play.
       Hear the bells ring
       ""Ting-a-ling-ding"",
  Hurrah for Thanksgiving Day!
Over the river, and through the wood
  Trot fast, my dapple-gray!
       Spring over the ground,
       Like a hunting-hound!
  For this is Thanksgiving Day.
Over the river, and through the wood,
  And straight through the barn-yard gate.
       We seem to go
       Extremely slow,—
  It is so hard to wait!
Over the river and through the wood—
  Now grandmother's cap I spy!
       Hurrah for the fun!
       Is the pudding done?
  Hurrah for the pumpkin-pie!",The poem was written in the early 20th century. It was written for a group of friends who were traveling on a sleigh on Thanksgiving Day.
Thanksgiving,"We walk on starry fields of white
   And do not see the daisies;
For blessings common in our sight
   We rarely offer praises.
We sigh for some supreme delight
   To crown our lives with splendor,
And quite ignore our daily store
   Of pleasures sweet and tender.
Our cares are bold and push their way
   Upon our thought and feeling.
They hand about us all the day,
   Our time from pleasure stealing.
So unobtrusive many a joy
   We pass by and forget it,
But worry strives to own our lives,
   And conquers if we let it.
There’s not a day in all the year
   But holds some hidden pleasure,
And looking back, joys oft appear
   To brim the past’s wide measure.
But blessings are like friends, I hold,
   Who love and labor near us.
We ought to raise our notes of praise
   While living hearts can hear us.
Full many a blessing wears the guise
   Of worry or of trouble;
Far-seeing is the soul, and wise,
   Who knows the mask is double.
But he who has the faith and strength
   To thank his God for sorrow
Has found a joy without alloy
   To gladden every morrow.
We ought to make the moments notes
   Of happy, glad Thanksgiving;
The hours and days a silent phrase
   Of music we are living.
And so the theme should swell and grow
   As weeks and months pass o’er us,
And rise sublime at this good time,
   A grand Thanksgiving chorus.",We walk on starry fields of white and do not see the daisies. We rarely offer praises. We sigh for some supreme delight. We ignore our daily store of pleasures sweet and tender.
For My People,"For my people everywhere singing their slave songs
     repeatedly: their dirges and their ditties and their blues 
     and jubilees, praying their prayers nightly to an
     unknown god, bending their knees humbly to an
     unseen power;
For my people lending their strength to the years, to the 
    gone years and the now years and the maybe years,
    washing ironing cooking scrubbing sewing mending
    hoeing plowing digging planting pruning patching
    dragging along never gaining never reaping never
    knowing and never understanding;
For my playmates in the clay and dust and sand of Alabama
    backyards playing baptizing and preaching and doctor
    and jail and soldier and school and mama and cooking
    and playhouse and concert and store and hair and Miss
    Choomby and company;
For the cramped bewildered years we went to school to learn 
    to know the reasons why and the answers to and the
    people who and the places where and the days when, in
    memory of the bitter hours when we discovered we
    were black and poor and small and different and nobody
    cared and nobody wondered and nobody understood;
For the boys and girls who grew in spite of these things to
    be man and woman, to laugh and dance and sing and
    play and drink their wine and religion and success, to
    marry their playmates and bear children and then die
    of consumption and anemia and lynching;
For my people thronging 47th Street in Chicago and Lenox
    Avenue in New York and Rampart Street in New
    Orleans, lost disinherited dispossessed and happy
    people filling the cabarets and taverns and other
    people’s pockets needing bread and shoes and milk and
    land and money and something—something all our own;
For my people walking blindly spreading joy, losing time
     being lazy, sleeping when hungry, shouting when
     burdened, drinking when hopeless, tied, and shackled
     and tangled among ourselves by the unseen creatures
     who tower over us omnisciently and laugh;
For my people blundering and groping and floundering in
     the dark of churches and schools and clubs and
     societies, associations and councils and committees and 
     conventions, distressed and disturbed and deceived and
     devoured by money-hungry glory-craving leeches,
     preyed on by facile force of state and fad and novelty, by
     false prophet and holy believer;
For my people standing staring trying to fashion a better way
    from confusion, from hypocrisy and misunderstanding,
    trying to fashion a world that will hold all the people,
    all the faces, all the adams and eves and their countless
    generations;
Let a new earth rise. Let another world be born. Let a
    bloody peace be written in the sky. Let a second
    generation full of courage issue forth; let a people
    loving freedom come to growth. Let a beauty full of
    healing and a strength of final clenching be the pulsing
    in our spirits and our blood. Let the martial songs
    be written, let the dirges disappear. Let a race of men now 
    rise and take control.","For my people everywhere singing their slave songs repeatedly: their dirges and their ditties and their blues. For the boys and girls who grew in spite of these things to be man and woman, to laugh and dance and sing and play and drink their wine and religion and success."
Vaccinated,"I once saw Jazell Barbie Royale
Do Whitney Houston so well
I got upset with myself for sneaking 
Past the cashier 
After having been patted down. Security frisks you 
For nothing. They don’t believe in trouble. They don’t 
Imagine a gun or a blade, though
Sometimes they make you walk all the way back 
To the car with the weed you didn’t tuck well.
No one’s at fault. That’s how they say it
Where I’m from. Everyone’s got a job. 
I should have paid. Our women
Need to perform for the tips they couldn’t earn
After the state shut down for good reason 
And too late. We lost so many friends. 
My buddy Janir swears 
He still can’t smell his lip balm. Our women need us 
To call them beautiful 
Because they are. They’ve done what they must
To prove it, and how often does any woman get
To hear the truth? Jazell is so pretty.
Whitney Houston is dead. No one wore a mask.
It wasn’t safe, so it wasn’t really free.
If you don’t watch me, I’ll get by you. I’ll take
What I’ve been missing. My mother says 
That’s not how she raised me. I spent 
A year and a half sure she’d die.
The women who lip sync for us could die.
People like to murder them, 
And almost everyone else wonders
If they should be dead. Who got dressed looking 
For safety today? Who got patted down?  My mother 
Says what we do is sin. But all we do 
Is party. Even when I’m broke, I can 
Entertain. You’re going to miss me some day. 
You’re going to forget the words to your favorite song. 
You’re going to miss me when I’m gone.","Where I’m from, everyone’s got a job. Our women need us to call them beautiful. They’ve done what they must to prove it. Jazell is so pretty. No one wore a mask."
"To the Virgins, to Make Much of Time","Gather ye rosebuds while ye may,
   Old Time is still a-flying;
And this same flower that smiles today
   Tomorrow will be dying.
The glorious lamp of heaven, the sun,
   The higher he's a-getting,
The sooner will his race be run,
   And nearer he's to setting.
That age is best which is the first,
   When youth and blood are warmer;
But being spent, the worse, and worst
   Times still succeed the former.
Then be not coy, but use your time,
   And while ye may, go marry;
For having lost but once your prime,
   You may forever tarry.","Gather ye rosebuds while ye may, may ye may. Old Time is still a-flying;. This same flower that smiles today will be dying."
Leda and the Swan,"A sudden blow: the great wings beating still
Above the staggering girl, her thighs caressed
By the dark webs, her nape caught in his bill,
He holds her helpless breast upon his breast.
How can those terrified vague fingers push
The feathered glory from her loosening thighs?
And how can body, laid in that white rush,
But feel the strange heart beating where it lies?
A shudder in the loins engenders there
The broken wall, the burning roof and tower
And Agamemnon dead.
                    Being so caught up,
So mastered by the brute blood of the air,
Did she put on his knowledge with his power
Before the indifferent beak could let her drop?","The story of Agamemnon, who was killed by a bird of prey. The story is told in the form of a series of short stories by the same name."
To make a prairie (1755),"To make a prairie it takes a clover and one bee,
One clover, and a bee.
And revery.

If bees are few.","To make a prairie it takes a clover and one bee, one clover, and a bee. The revery alone will do, if bees are few."
A Christmas Carol,"In the bleak mid-winter
   Frosty wind made moan,
Earth stood hard as iron,
   Water like a stone;
Snow had fallen, snow on snow,
   Snow on snow,
In the bleak mid-winter 
   Long ago.

Our God, Heaven cannot hold Him
   Nor earth sustain;
Heaven and earth shall flee away
   When He comes to reign:
In the bleak midwinter
   A stable-place sufficed
The Lord God Almighty
   Jesus Christ.

Enough for Him, whom cherubim
   Worship night and day,
A breastful of milk
   And a mangerful of hay;
Enough for Him, whom angels
   Fall down before,
The ox and ass and camel
   Which adore.

Angels and archangels
   May have gathered there,
Cherubim and seraphim
   Thronged the air;
But only His mother
   In her maiden bliss
Worshipped the Beloved
   With a kiss.

What can I give Him,
   Poor as I am?
If I were a shepherd
   I would bring a lamb,
If I were a Wise Man
   I would do my part,—
Yet what I can I give Him,
   Give my heart.",In the bleak mid-winter a stable-place sufficed for the Lord God Almighty. A breastful of milk and a mangerful of hay was enough for Him.
Coherence in Consequence,"Imagine them in black, the morning heat losing within this day that floats. And always there is the being, and the not-seeing on their way to—
The days they approach and their sharpest aches will wrap experience until knowledge is translucent, the frost on which they find themselves slipping. Never mind the loose mindless grip of their forms reflected in the eye-watering hues of the surface, these two will survive in their capacity to meet, to hold the other beneath the plummeting, in the depths below each step full of avoidance. What they create will be held up, will resume: the appetite is bigger than joy. indestructible. for never was it independent from who they are. who will be.

What I Am,"Fred Sanford's on at 12
& I'm standing in the express lane (cash only)
about to buy Head & Shoulders
the white people shampoo, no one knows
what I am. My name could be Lamont.
George Clinton wears colors like Toucan Sam,
the Froot Loop pelican. Follow your nose,
he says. But I have no nose, no mouth,
so you tell me what's good, what's god,
what's funky. When I stop
by McDonalds for a cheeseburger, no one
suspects what I am. I smile at Ronald's poster,
perpetual grin behind the pissed-off, fly-girl
cashier I love. Where are my goddamn fries?
Ain't I American? I never say, Niggaz
in my poems. My ancestors didn't
emigrate. Why would anyone leave
their native land? I'm thinking about shooting
some hoop later on. I'll dunk on everyone
of those niggaz. They have no idea
what I am. I might be the next Jordan
god. They don't know if Toni Morrison
is a woman or a man. Michael Jackson
is the biggest name in showbiz. Mamma se 
Mamma sa mamma ku sa, sang the Bushmen 
in Africa. I'll buy a dimebag after the game, 
me & Jody. He says, Fuck them white people 
at work, Man. He was an All-American 
in high school. He's cool, but he don't know 
what I am, & so what. Fred Sanford's on 
in a few & I got the dandruff-free head 
& shoulders of white people & a cheeseburger 
belly & a Thriller CD & Nike high tops 
& slavery's dead & the TV's my daddy-- 
   You big Dummy!

We Should Make a Documentary About Spades,"And here is all we’ll need: a card deck, quartets of sun people
Of the sort found in black college dormitories, some vintage
Music, indiscriminate spirits, fried chicken, some paper,

A writing utensil, and a bottomless Saturday. We should explore
The origins of a derogatory word like spade as well as the word
For feeling alone in polite company. And also the implications
Of calling someone who is not your brother or sister,

Brother or Sister. So little is known of our past, we can imagine
Damn near anything. When I say maybe slaves held Spades
Tournaments on the anti-cruise ships bound for the Colonies,
You say when our ancestors were cooped on those ships

They were not yet slaves. Our groundbreaking film should begin
With a low-lit den in the Deep South and the deep fried voice
Of somebody’s grandmother holding smoke in her mouth
As she says, “The two of Diamonds trumps the two of Spades

In my house.” And at some point someone should tell the story
Where Jesus and the devil are Spades partners traveling
The juke joints of the 1930s. We could interview my uncle Junior
And definitely your skinny cousin Mary and any black man

Sitting at a card table wearing shades. Who do you suppose
Would win if Booker T and MLK were matched against Du Bois
And Malcolm X in a game of Spades? You say don’t talk
Across the table. Pay attention to the suits being played.

The object of the game is to communicate invisibly
With your teammate. I should concentrate. Do you suppose
We are here because we are lonely in some acute diasporafied
Way? This should be explored in our film about Spades.

Because it is one of the ways I am still learning what it is
To be black, tonight I am ready to master Spades. Four players
Bid a number of books. Each team adds the bids
Of the two partners, and the total is the number of books

That team must try to win. Is that not right? This is a game
That tests the boundary between mathematics and magic,
If you ask me. A bid must be intuitive like the itchiness
Of the your upper lip before you sip strange whiskey.

My mother did not drink, which is how I knew something
Was wrong with her, but she held a dry spot at the table
When couples came to play. It’s a scene from my history,
But this probably should not be mentioned in our documentary

About Spades. Renege is akin to the word for the shame
You feel watching someone else’s humiliation. Slapping
A card down must be as dramatic as hitting the face of a drum
With your palm, not hitting the face of a drum with a drumstick.

You say there may be the sort of outrage induced
By liquor, trash talk, and poor strategy, but it will fade
The way a watermark left on a table by a cold glass fades.
I suspect winning this sort of game makes you feel godly.

I’m good and ready for who ever we’re playing
Against tonight. I am trying to imagine our enemy.
I know you are not my enemy. You say there are no enemies
In Spades. Spades is a game our enemies do not play.",The origins of a derogatory word like spade as well as the word for feeling alone in polite company should be explored in a new documentary. The film should begin with a low-lit den in the Deep South and the deep fried voice of somebody's grandmother.
Christmas Carol,"   Ring out, ye bells!
   All Nature swells
With gladness at the wondrous story,—
   The world was lorn,
   But Christ is born
To change our sadness into glory.

   Sing, earthlings, sing!
   To-night a King
Hath come from heaven's high throne to bless us.
   The outstretched hand
   O'er all the land
Is raised in pity to caress us.

   Come at his call;
   Be joyful all;
Away with mourning and with sadness!
   The heavenly choir
   With holy fire
Their voices raise in songs of gladness.

   The darkness breaks
   And Dawn awakes,
Her cheeks suffused with youthful blushes.
   The rocks and stones
   In holy tones
Are singing sweeter than the thrushes.

   Then why should we
   In silence be,
When Nature lends her voice to praises;
   When heaven and earth
   Proclaim the truth
Of Him for whom that lone star blazes?

   No, be not still,
   But with a will
Strike all your harps and set them ringing;
   On hill and heath
   Let every breath
Throw all its power into singing!","The book is called ""The Song of Songs"" and is published by Oxford University Press. It is written in the style of the hymn ""The Lord's Prayer"""
The Owl and the Pussy-Cat,"The Owl and the Pussy-Cat went to sea
   In a beautiful pea-green boat:
They took some honey, and plenty of money
   Wrapped up in a five-pound note.
The Owl looked up to the stars above,
   And sang to a small guitar,
""O lovely Pussy, O Pussy, my love,
   What a beautiful Pussy you are,
            You are,
            You are!
   What a beautiful Pussy you are!""
Pussy said to the Owl, ""You elegant fowl,
   How charmingly sweet you sing!
Oh! let us be married; too long we have tarried,
   But what shall we do for a ring?""
They sailed away, for a year and a day,
To the land where the bong-tree grows;
And there in a wood a Piggy-wig stood,
   With a ring at the end of his nose,
            His nose,
            His nose,
   With a ring at the end of his nose.
""Dear Pig, are you willing to sell for one shilling
   Your ring?"" Said the Piggy, ""I will.""
So they took it away, and were married next day
   By the turkey who lives on the hill.
They dined on mince and slices of quince,
   Which they ate with a runcible spoon;
And hand in hand, on the edge of the sand,
   They danced by the light of the moon,
            The moon,
            The moon,
   They danced by the light of the moon.","The Owl and the Pussy-Cat went to sea in a beautiful pea-green boat. They took some honey, and plenty of money wrapped up in a five-pound note. They sailed away, for a year and a day, to the land where the bong-tree grows."
A Visit from St. Nicholas,"'Twas the night before Christmas, when all through the house
Not a creature was stirring, not even a mouse;
The stockings were hung by the chimney with care,
In hopes that St. Nicholas soon would be there;
The children were nestled all snug in their beds,
While visions of sugar-plums danced in their heads;
And mamma in her ’kerchief, and I in my cap,
Had just settled our brains for a long winter’s nap,
When out on the lawn there arose such a clatter,
I sprang from the bed to see what was the matter.
Away to the window I flew like a flash,
Tore open the shutters and threw up the sash.
The moon on the breast of the new-fallen snow
Gave the lustre of mid-day to objects below,
When, what to my wondering eyes should appear,
But a miniature sleigh, and eight tiny reindeer,
With a little old driver, so lively and quick,
I knew in a moment it must be St. Nick.
More rapid than eagles his coursers they came,
And he whistled, and shouted, and called them by name;
""Now, Dasher! now, Dancer! now, Prancer and Vixen!
On, Comet! on, Cupid! on, Donder and Blitzen!
To the top of the porch! to the top of the wall!
Now dash away! dash away! dash away all!""
As dry leaves that before the wild hurricane fly,
When they meet with an obstacle, mount to the sky;
So up to the house-top the coursers they flew,
With the sleigh full of Toys, and St. Nicholas too.
And then, in a twinkling, I heard on the roof
The prancing and pawing of each little hoof.
As I drew in my head, and was turning around,
Down the chimney St. Nicholas came with a bound.
He was dressed all in fur, from his head to his foot,
And his clothes were all tarnished with ashes and soot;
A bundle of Toys he had flung on his back,
And he looked like a pedler just opening his pack.
His eyes—how they twinkled! his dimples how merry!
His cheeks were like roses, his nose like a cherry!
His droll little mouth was drawn up like a bow
And the beard of his chin was as white as the snow;
The stump of a pipe he held tight in his teeth,
And the smoke it encircled his head like a wreath;
He had a broad face and a little round belly,
That shook when he laughed, like a bowlful of jelly.
He was chubby and plump, a right jolly old elf,
And I laughed when I saw him, in spite of myself;
A wink of his eye and a twist of his head,
Soon gave me to know I had nothing to dread;
He spoke not a word, but went straight to his work,
And filled all the stockings; then turned with a jerk,
And laying his finger aside of his nose,
And giving a nod, up the chimney he rose;
He sprang to his sleigh, to his team gave a whistle,
And away they all flew like the down of a thistle,
But I heard him exclaim, ere he drove out of sight,
""Happy Christmas to all, and to all a good-night.""","'Twas the night before Christmas, when all through the house not a creature was stirring, not even a mouse' 'When out on the lawn there arose such a clatter,                I sprang from the bed to see what was the matter' 'And what to my wondering eyes should appear, but a miniature sleigh, and eight tiny reindeer'"
Hurricane,"Four tickets left, I let her go—

Alone,"Lying, thinking
Last night
How to find my soul a home
Where water is not thirsty
And bread loaf is not stone
I came up with one thing
And I don’t believe I’m wrong
That nobody,
But nobody
Can make it out here alone.
Alone, all alone
Nobody, but nobody
Can make it out here alone.
There are some millionaires
With money they can’t use
Their wives run round like banshees
Their children sing the blues
They’ve got expensive doctors
To cure their hearts of stone.
But nobody
No, nobody
Can make it out here alone.
Alone, all alone
Nobody, but nobody
Can make it out here alone.

I'll tell you what I know

The wind is gonna blow

And I can hear the moan,

Lenore,"Ah broken is the golden bowl! the spirit flown forever!
Let the bell toll!--a saintly soul floats on the Stygian river;
And, Guy De Vere, hast thou no tear?--weep now or never more!
See! on yon drear and rigid bier low lies thy love, Lenore!
Come! let the burial rite be read--the funeral song be sung!--
An anthem for the queenliest dead that ever died so young--
A dirge for her the doubly dead in that she died so young.
""Wretches! ye loved her for her wealth and hated her for her pride,
""And when she fell in feeble health, ye blessed her--that she died!
""How shall the ritual, then, be read?--the requiem how be sung
""By you--by yours, the evil eye,--by yours, the slanderous tongue
""That did to death the innocent that died, and died so young?""
Peccavimus; but rave not thus! and let a Sabbath song
Go up to God so solemnly the dead may feel so wrong!
The sweet Lenore hath ""gone before,"" with Hope, that flew beside
Leaving thee wild for the dear child that should have been thy bride--
For her, the fair and debonair, that now so lowly lies,
The life upon her yellow hair but not within her eyes--
The life still there, upon her hair--the death upon her eyes.
""Avaunt! to-night my heart is light. No dirge will I upraise,
""But waft the angel on her flight with a Pæan of old days!
""Let no bell toll!--lest her sweet soul, amid its hallowed mirth,
""Should catch the note, as it doth float up from the damnéd Earth.

little silent Christmas tree
you are so little
you are more like a flower
who found you in the green forest
and were you very sorry to come away?
see            i will comfort you
because you smell so sweetly
i will kiss your cool bark
and hug you safe and tight
just as your mother would,
only don’t be afraid
look           the spangles
that sleep all the year in a dark box
dreaming of being taken out and allowed to shine,
the balls the chains red and gold the fluffy threads,
put up your little arms
and i’ll give them all to you to hold.
every finger shall have its ring
and there won’t be a single place dark or unhappy
then when you’re quite dressed
you’ll stand in the window for everyone to see
and how they’ll stare!
oh but you’ll be very proud
and my little sister and i will take hands
and looking up at our beautiful tree
we’ll dance and sing

Heart to Heart,"It’s neither red
nor sweet.
It doesn’t melt
or turn over,
break or harden,
so it can’t feel
pain,
yearning,
regret.
It doesn’t have 
a tip to spin on,
it isn’t even
shapely—
just a thick clutch
of muscle,
lopsided,
mute. Still,
I feel it inside
its cage sounding
a dull tattoo:
I want, I want—
but I can’t open it:
there’s no key.
I can’t wear it
on my sleeve,
or tell you from
the bottom of it
how I feel. Here,
it’s all yours, now—
but you’ll have
to take me,
too.","It doesn’t melt, turn over, break or harden. It’s neither red nor sweet. Still, I feel it inside its cage sounding like a dull tattoo. I want, I want to open it, but I can’n't."
To Autumn,"Season of mists and mellow fruitfulness,
  Close bosom-friend of the maturing sun;
Conspiring with him how to load and bless
  With fruit the vines that round the thatch-eves run;
To bend with apples the moss’d cottage-trees,
  And fill all fruit with ripeness to the core;
    To swell the gourd, and plump the hazel shells
  With a sweet kernel; to set budding more,
And still more, later flowers for the bees,
Until they think warm days will never cease,
    For summer has o’er-brimm’d their clammy cells.
Who hath not seen thee oft amid thy store?
  Sometimes whoever seeks abroad may find
Thee sitting careless on a granary floor,
  Thy hair soft-lifted by the winnowing wind;
Or on a half-reap’d furrow sound asleep,
  Drowsed with the fume of poppies, while thy hook
    Spares the next swath and all its twined flowers:
And sometimes like a gleaner thou dost keep
  Steady thy laden head across a brook;
  Or by a cider-press, with patient look,
    Thou watchest the last oozings, hours by hours.
Where are the songs of Spring? Ay, where are they?
  Think not of them, thou hast thy music too,—
While barred clouds bloom the soft-dying day,
  And touch the stubble-plains with rosy hue;
Then in a wailful choir the small gnats mourn
  Among the river sallows, borne aloft
    Or sinking as the light wind lives or dies;
And full-grown lambs loud bleat from hilly bourn;
  Hedge-crickets sing; and now with treble soft
  The redbreast whistles from a garden-croft,
    And gathering swallows twitter in the skies.","Season of mists and mellow fruitfulness. Close bosom-friend of the maturing sun. The redbreast whistles from a garden-croft, gathering swallows twitter in the skies."
My mistress' eyes are nothing like the sun (Sonnet 130),"My mistress' eyes are nothing like the sun;
Coral is far more red than her lips' red;
If snow be white, why then her breasts are dun;
If hairs be wires, black wires grow on her head.
I have seen roses damasked, red and white,
But no such roses see I in her cheeks;
And in some perfumes is there more delight
Than in the breath that from my mistress reeks.
I love to hear her speak, yet well I know
That music hath a far more pleasing sound;
I grant I never saw a goddess go;
My mistress when she walks treads on the ground.
     And yet, by heaven, I think my love as rare
     As any she belied with false compare.","""My mistress' eyes are nothing like the sun""; ""Her lips are far more red than her lips' red""; ""If snow be white, why then her breasts are dun""; ""I have seen roses damasked, red and white, but no such roses see I in her cheeks""; ""In some perfumes is there more delight than in the breath that from my mistress reeks"""
On Death,"Then Almitra spoke, saying, We would ask now of Death.
    And he said:
    You would know the secret of death.
    But how shall you find it unless you seek it in the heart of life?
    The owl whose night-bound eyes are blind unto the day cannot unveil the mystery of light.
    If you would indeed behold the spirit of death, open your heart wide unto the body of life.
    For life and death are one, even as the river and the sea are one.
    In the depth of your hopes and desires lies your silent knowledge of the beyond;
    And like seeds dreaming beneath the snow your heart dreams of spring.
    Trust the dreams, for in them is hidden the gate to eternity.
    Your fear of death is but the trembling of the shepherd when he stands before the king whose hand is to be laid upon him in honour.
    Is the shepherd not joyful beneath his trembling, that he shall wear the mark of the king?
    Yet is he not more mindful of his trembling?
    For what is it to die but to stand naked in the wind and to melt into the sun?
    And what is it to cease breathing, but to free the breath from its restless tides, that it may rise and expand and seek God unencumbered?
    Only when you drink from the river of silence shall you indeed sing.
    And when you have reached the mountain top, then you shall begin to climb.
    And when the earth shall claim your limbs, then shall you truly dance.","Almitra said: 'If you would indeed behold the spirit of death, open your heart wide unto the body of life' He added: 'For what is it to die but to stand naked in the wind and to melt into the sun?'"
A Prayer for my Daughter,"Once more the storm is howling, and half hid
Under this cradle-hood and coverlid
My child sleeps on. There is no obstacle
But Gregory's wood and one bare hill
Whereby the haystack- and roof-levelling wind,
Bred on the Atlantic, can be stayed;
And for an hour I have walked and prayed
Because of the great gloom that is in my mind.
I have walked and prayed for this young child an hour
And heard the sea-wind scream upon the tower,
And under the arches of the bridge, and scream
In the elms above the flooded stream;
Imagining in excited reverie
That the future years had come,
Dancing to a frenzied drum,
Out of the murderous innocence of the sea.
May she be granted beauty and yet not
Beauty to make a stranger's eye distraught,
Or hers before a looking-glass, for such,
Being made beautiful overmuch,
Consider beauty a sufficient end,
Lose natural kindness and maybe
The heart-revealing intimacy
That chooses right, and never find a friend.
Helen being chosen found life flat and dull
And later had much trouble from a fool,
While that great Queen, that rose out of the spray,
Being fatherless could have her way
Yet chose a bandy-leggèd smith for man.
It's certain that fine women eat
A crazy salad with their meat
Whereby the Horn of Plenty is undone.
In courtesy I'd have her chiefly learned;
Hearts are not had as a gift but hearts are earned
By those that are not entirely beautiful;
Yet many, that have played the fool
For beauty's very self, has charm made wise,
And many a poor man that has roved,
Loved and thought himself beloved,
From a glad kindness cannot take his eyes.
May she become a flourishing hidden tree
That all her thoughts may like the linnet be,
And have no business but dispensing round
Their magnanimities of sound,
Nor but in merriment begin a chase,
Nor but in merriment a quarrel.
O may she live like some green laurel
Rooted in one dear perpetual place.
My mind, because the minds that I have loved,
The sort of beauty that I have approved,
Prosper but little, has dried up of late,
Yet knows that to be choked with hate
May well be of all evil chances chief.
If there's no hatred in a mind
Assault and battery of the wind
Can never tear the linnet from the leaf.
An intellectual hatred is the worst,
So let her think opinions are accursed.
Have I not seen the loveliest woman born
Out of the mouth of Plenty's horn,
Because of her opinionated mind
Barter that horn and every good
By quiet natures understood
For an old bellows full of angry wind?
Considering that, all hatred driven hence,
The soul recovers radical innocence
And learns at last that it is self-delighting,
Self-appeasing, self-affrighting,
And that its own sweet will is Heaven's will;
She can, though every face should scowl
And every windy quarter howl
Or every bellows burst, be happy still.
And may her bridegroom bring her to a house
Where all's accustomed, ceremonious;
For arrogance and hatred are the wares
Peddled in the thoroughfares.
How but in custom and in ceremony
Are innocence and beauty born?
Ceremony's a name for the rich horn,
And custom for the spreading laurel tree.",The poem was written by the French poet Jean-Michel Cousteau. It was written in the early 19th century. The poem is titled 'The Horn of Plenty' and is written in French and English.
Shoulders,"A man crosses the street in rain,
stepping gently, looking two times north and south,
because his son is asleep on his shoulder.
No car must splash him.
No car drive too near to his shadow.
This man carries the world’s most sensitive cargo
but he’s not marked.
Nowhere does his jacket say FRAGILE,
HANDLE WITH CARE.
His ear fills up with breathing.
He hears the hum of a boy’s dream
deep inside him.
We’re not going to be able
to live in this world
if we’re not willing to do what he’s doing
with one another.
The road will only be wide.
The rain will never stop falling.","A man crosses the street in rain, looking two times north and south, because his son is asleep on his shoulder. He hears the hum of a boy's dream deep inside him."
On Marriage,"Then Almitra spoke again and said, And what of Marriage, master?
      And he answered saying:
      You were born together, and together you shall be forevermore.
      You shall be together when the white wings of death scatter your days.
      Ay, you shall be together even in the silent memory of God.
      But let there be spaces in your togetherness,
      And let the winds of the heavens dance between you.
     Love one another, but make not a bond of love:
      Let it rather be a moving sea between the shores of your souls.
      Fill each other’s cup but drink not from one cup.
      Give one another of your bread but eat not from the same loaf.
      Sing and dance together and be joyous, but let each one of your be alone,
      Even as the strings of the lute are alone though they quiver with the same music.
     Give your hearts, but not into each other’s keeping.
      For only the hand of Life can contain your hearts.
      And stand together yet not too near together:
      For the pillars of the temple stand apart,
      And the oak tree and the cypress grow not in each other’s shadow.","Almitra said: 'You were born together, and together you shall be forevermore' 'Let there be spaces in your togetherness, let the winds of the heavens dance between you'"

A time to be born, a time to die;

A time to kill, and a time to heal;

I Must Become a Menace to My Enemies,"Dedicated to the Poet Agostinho Neto,
President of The People’s Republic of Angola: 1976
1
I will no longer lightly walk behind
a one of you who fear me:
                                     Be afraid.
I plan to give you reasons for your jumpy fits
and facial tics
I will not walk politely on the pavements anymore
and this is dedicated in particular
to those who hear my footsteps
or the insubstantial rattling of my grocery
cart
then turn around
see me
and hurry on
away from this impressive terror I must be:
I plan to blossom bloody on an afternoon
surrounded by my comrades singing
terrible revenge in merciless
accelerating
rhythms
But
I have watched a blind man studying his face.
I have set the table in the evening and sat down
to eat the news.
Regularly
I have gone to sleep.
There is no one to forgive me.
The dead do not give a damn.
I live like a lover
who drops her dime into the phone
just as the subway shakes into the station
wasting her message
canceling the question of her call:
fulminating or forgetful but late
and always after the fact that could save or 
condemn me
I must become the action of my fate.
2
How many of my brothers and my sisters
will they kill
before I teach myself
retaliation?
Shall we pick a number? 
South Africa for instance:
do we agree that more than ten thousand
in less than a year but that less than
five thousand slaughtered in more than six
months will
WHAT IS THE MATTER WITH ME?
I must become a menace to my enemies.
3
And if I 
if I ever let you slide
who should be extirpated from my universe
who should be cauterized from earth
completely
(lawandorder jerkoffs of the first the
                   terrorist degree)
then let my body fail my soul
in its bedeviled lecheries
And if I 
if I ever let love go
because the hatred and the whisperings
become a phantom dictate I o-
bey in lieu of impulse and realities
(the blossoming flamingos of my
                   wild mimosa trees)
then let love freeze me
out.
I must become
I must become a menace to my enemies.","The poem is dedicated to the Poet Agostinho Neto, President of The People’s Republic of Angola in 1976. It is titled: ‘I will no longer lightly walk behind’"

She Walks in Beauty,"I.
She walks in beauty, like the night
Of cloudless climes and starry skies;
And all that’s best of dark and bright
Meet in her aspect and her eyes:
Thus mellowed to that tender light
Which heaven to gaudy day denies.
II.
One shade the more, one ray the less,
Had half impaired the nameless grace
Which waves in every raven tress,
Or softly lightens o’er her face;
Where thoughts serenely sweet express
How pure, how dear their dwelling place.
III.
And on that cheek, and o’er that brow,
So soft, so calm, yet eloquent,
The smiles that win, the tints that glow,
But tell of days in goodness spent,
A mind at peace with all below,
A heart whose love is innocent!","The poem is about a woman who walks in beauty, like the night. The author describes her as ""soft, so calm, yet eloquent, with a heart whose love is innocent!"""
The Heart of the Tree,"What does he plant who plants a tree?
   He plants a friend of sun and sky;
He plants the flag of breezes free;
   The shaft of beauty, towering high;
   He plants a home to heaven anigh;
      For song and mother-croon of bird
      In hushed and happy twilight heard—
The treble of heaven's harmony—
These things he plants who plants a tree.
What does he plant who plants a tree?
   He plants cool shade and tender rain,
And seed and bud of days to be,
   And years that fade and flush again;
      He plants the glory of the plain;
      He plants the forest's heritage;
      The harvest of a coming age;
The joy that unborn eyes shall see—
These things he plants who plants a tree.
What does he plant who plants a tree?
   He plants, in sap and leaf and wood,
In love of home and loyalty
   And far-cast thought of civic good—
   His blessings on the neighborhood,
      Who in the hollow of His hand
      Holds all the growth of all our land—
A nation's growth from sea to sea
Stirs in his heart who plants a tree.","The poem is called ""The Tree of Life"" and is written in the form of a sonnet. It is about a man who plants a tree for the love of home and loyalty."
The Star-Spangled Banner,"O say, can you see, by the dawn's early light,
What so proudly we hailed at the twilight's last gleaming?
Whose broad stripes and bright stars through the perilous fight,
O'er the ramparts we watched were so gallantly streaming;
And the rocket's red glare, the bombs bursting in air,
Gave proof through the night that our flag was still there;
O say, does that star-spangled banner yet wave
O'er the land of the free, and the home of the brave?
On the shore dimly seen through the mists of the deep,
Where the foe's haughty host in dread silence reposes,
What is that which the breeze, o'er the towering steep,
As it fitfully blows, now conceals, now discloses?
Now it catches the gleam of the morning's first beam,
In full glory reflected now shines on the stream;
'Tis the star-spangled banner; O long may it wave
O'er the land of the free, and the home of the brave!
And where is that band who so vauntingly swore
That the havoc of war and the battle's confusion
A home and a country should leave us no more?
Their blood has washed out their foul footsteps' pollution.
No refuge could save the hireling and slave,
From the terror of flight and the gloom of the grave;
And the star-spangled banner in triumph doth wave
O'er the land of the free, and the home of the brave!
O! thus be it ever, when freemen shall stand
Between their loved homes and the war's desolation!
Blest with victory and peace, may the heav'n-rescued land,
Praise the power that hath made and preserved us a nation.
Then conquer we must, for our cause it is just.
And this be our motto— ""In God is our trust; ""
And the star-spangled banner in triumph shall wave
O'er the land of the free, and the home of the brave.","""The Star-spangled Banner"" is a poem by U.S. poet William Butler Yeats. Yeats: ""O long may it wave!"" ""In God is our trust"""
Poetry,"I too, dislike it: there are things that are important beyond all this fiddle.
   Reading it, however, with a perfect contempt for it, one discovers that there is in
   it after all, a place for the genuine.
      Hands that can grasp, eyes
      that can dilate, hair that can rise
         if it must, these things are important not because a
high-sounding interpretation can be put upon them but because they are
   useful; when they become so derivative as to become unintelligible, the
   same thing may be said for all of us—that we
      do not admire what
      we cannot understand. The bat,
         holding on upside down or in quest of something to
eat, elephants pushing, a wild horse taking a roll, a tireless wolf under
   a tree, the immovable critic twinkling his skin like a horse that feels a flea, the base—
   ball fan, the statistician—case after case
      could be cited did
      one wish it; nor is it valid
         to discriminate against “business documents and
school-books”; all these phenomena are important. One must make a distinction
   however: when dragged into prominence by half poets, the result is not poetry,
   nor till the autocrats among us can be
     “literalists of
      the imagination”—above
         insolence and triviality and can present
for inspection, imaginary gardens with real toads in them, shall we have
   it. In the meantime, if you demand on the one hand, in defiance of their opinion—
   the raw material of poetry in
      all its rawness, and
      that which is on the other hand,
         genuine, then you are interested in poetry.","Poetry is not poetry, but the raw material of poetry in all its rawness. The bat, elephants pushing, a wild horse taking a roll, a tireless wolf under a tree are important."
American History,"Those four black girls blown up
in that Alabama church
remind me of five hundred
middle passage blacks,
in a net, under water
in Charleston harbor
so redcoats wouldn't find them.
Can't find what you can't see
can you?","Those four black girls blown up in Alabama remind me of five hundred black passage blacks,                in a net, under water                in Charleston harbor. Can't find what you can't see                can you?"
The Shield of Achilles,"    She looked over his shoulder
       For vines and olive trees,
    Marble well-governed cities
       And ships upon untamed seas,
    But there on the shining metal
       His hands had put instead
    An artificial wilderness
       And a sky like lead.
A plain without a feature, bare and brown,
   No blade of grass, no sign of neighborhood,
Nothing to eat and nowhere to sit down,
   Yet, congregated on its blankness, stood
   An unintelligible multitude,
A million eyes, a million boots in line,
Without expression, waiting for a sign.
Out of the air a voice without a face
   Proved by statistics that some cause was just
In tones as dry and level as the place:
   No one was cheered and nothing was discussed;
   Column by column in a cloud of dust
They marched away enduring a belief
Whose logic brought them, somewhere else, to grief.
    She looked over his shoulder
       For ritual pieties,
    White flower-garlanded heifers,
       Libation and sacrifice,
    But there on the shining metal
       Where the altar should have been,
    She saw by his flickering forge-light
       Quite another scene.
Barbed wire enclosed an arbitrary spot
   Where bored officials lounged (one cracked a joke)
And sentries sweated for the day was hot:
   A crowd of ordinary decent folk
   Watched from without and neither moved nor spoke
As three pale figures were led forth and bound
To three posts driven upright in the ground.
The mass and majesty of this world, all
   That carries weight and always weighs the same
Lay in the hands of others; they were small
   And could not hope for help and no help came:
   What their foes liked to do was done, their shame
Was all the worst could wish; they lost their pride
And died as men before their bodies died.
    She looked over his shoulder
       For athletes at their games,
    Men and women in a dance
       Moving their sweet limbs
    Quick, quick, to music,
       But there on the shining shield
    His hands had set no dancing-floor
       But a weed-choked field.
A ragged urchin, aimless and alone,
   Loitered about that vacancy; a bird
Flew up to safety from his well-aimed stone:
   That girls are raped, that two boys knife a third,
   Were axioms to him, who'd never heard
Of any world where promises were kept,
Or one could weep because another wept.
    The thin-lipped armorer,
       Hephaestos, hobbled away,
    Thetis of the shining breasts
       Cried out in dismay
    At what the god had wrought
       To please her son, the strong
    Iron-hearted man-slaying Achilles
       Who would not live long.","She looked over his shoulder for vines and olive trees, marble well-governed cities, ships upon untamed seas, and flower-garlanded heifers. But there on the shining metal she saw an artificial wilderness, a sky like lead, and a plain without a feature."
Ode to My Socks,"Maru Mori brought me
a pair
of socks
which she knitted herself
with her sheepherder’s hands,
two socks as soft
as rabbits.
I slipped my feet
into them
as though into
two
cases
knitted
with threads of
twilight
and goatskin.
Violent socks,
my feet were
two fish made
of wool,
two long sharks
sea-blue, shot
through
by one golden thread,
two immense blackbirds,
two cannons:
my feet
were honored
in this way
by
these
heavenly
socks.
They were
so handsome
for the first time
my feet seemed to me
unacceptable
like two decrepit
firemen, firemen
unworthy
of that woven
fire,
of those glowing
socks.
Nevertheless
I resisted
the sharp temptation
to save them somewhere
as schoolboys
keep
fireflies,
as learned men
collect
sacred texts,
I resisted
the mad impulse
to put them
into a golden
cage
and each day give them
birdseed
and pieces of pink melon.
Like explorers
in the jungle who hand
over the very rare
green deer
to the spit
and eat it
with remorse,
I stretched out
my feet
and pulled on
the magnificent
socks
and then my shoes.
The moral
of my ode is this:
beauty is twice
beauty
and what is good is doubly
good
when it is a matter of two socks
made of wool
in winter.","Maru Mori brought me a pair of socks that she knitted herself with her sheepherder’s hands. The socks were made of wool and goatskin and were as soft as rabbits. For the first time, my feet seemed to me unacceptable."
Gate A-4,"Wandering around the Albuquerque Airport Terminal, after learning
my flight had been delayed four hours, I heard an announcement:
""If anyone in the vicinity of Gate A-4 understands any Arabic, please
come to the gate immediately.""
Well—one pauses these days. Gate A-4 was my own gate. I went there.
An older woman in full traditional Palestinian embroidered dress, just
like my grandma wore, was crumpled to the floor, wailing. ""Help,""
said the flight agent. ""Talk to her. What is her problem? We
told her the flight was going to be late and she did this.""
I stooped to put my arm around the woman and spoke haltingly.
""Shu-dow-a, Shu-bid-uck Habibti? Stani schway, Min fadlick, Shu-bit-
se-wee?"" The minute she heard any words she knew, however poorly
used, she stopped crying. She thought the flight had been cancelled
entirely. She needed to be in El Paso for major medical treatment the
next day. I said, ""No, we're fine, you'll get there, just later, who is
picking you up? Let's call him.""
We called her son, I spoke with him in English. I told him I would
stay with his mother till we got on the plane and ride next to
her. She talked to him. Then we called her other sons just
for the fun of it. Then we called my dad and he and she spoke for a while
in Arabic and found out of course they had ten shared friends. Then I
thought just for the heck of it why not call some Palestinian poets I know
and let them chat with her? This all took up two hours.
She was laughing a lot by then. Telling of her life, patting my knee,
answering questions. She had pulled a sack of homemade mamool
cookies—little powdered sugar crumbly mounds stuffed with dates and
nuts—from her bag—and was offering them to all the women at the gate.
To my amazement, not a single woman declined one. It was like a
sacrament. The traveler from Argentina, the mom from California, the
lovely woman from Laredo—we were all covered with the same powdered
sugar. And smiling. There is no better cookie.
And then the airline broke out free apple juice from huge coolers and two
little girls from our flight ran around serving it and they
were covered with powdered sugar, too. And I noticed my new best friend—
by now we were holding hands—had a potted plant poking out of her bag,
some medicinal thing, with green furry leaves. Such an old country tradi-
tion. Always carry a plant. Always stay rooted to somewhere.
And I looked around that gate of late and weary ones and I thought, This
is the world I want to live in. The shared world. Not a single person in that
gate—once the crying of confusion stopped—seemed apprehensive about
any other person. They took the cookies. I wanted to hug all those other women, too.
This can still happen anywhere. Not everything is lost.","The author's flight from Albuquerque to El Paso, Texas, was delayed four hours. A woman at Gate A-4 was wailing in Arabic, but when she spoke to her, she stopped crying. The woman offered cookies to all the women at the gate, and not a single woman declined."

The Village Blacksmith,"Under a spreading chestnut-tree
     ⁠The village smithy stands;
The smith, a mighty man is he,
     With large and sinewy hands,
And the muscles of his brawny arms
     Are strong as iron bands.
His hair is crisp, and black, and long;
     His face is like the tan;
His brow is wet with honest sweat,
     He earns whate'er he can,
And looks the whole world in the face,
     For he owes not any man.
Week in, week out, from morn till night,
     You can hear his bellows blow;
You can hear him swing his heavy sledge,
     With measured beat and slow,
Like a sexton ringing the village bell,
     When the evening sun is low.
And children coming home from school
     Look in at the open door;
They love to see the flaming forge,
     And hear the bellows roar,
And catch the burning sparks that fly
     Like chaff from a threshing-floor.
He goes on Sunday to the church,
     And sits among his boys;
He hears the parson pray and preach,
     He hears his daughter's voice
Singing in the village choir,
     And it makes his heart rejoice.
It sounds to him like her mother's voice
     Singing in Paradise!
He needs must think of her once more,
     How in the grave she lies;
And with his hard, rough hand he wipes
     A tear out of his eyes.
Toiling,—rejoicing,—sorrowing,
     Onward through life he goes;
Each morning sees some task begin,
     Each evening sees it close;
Something attempted, something done,
     Has earned a night's repose.
Thanks, thanks to thee, my worthy friend,
     For the lesson thou hast taught!
Thus at the flaming forge of life
     Our fortunes must be wrought;
Thus on its sounding anvil shaped
     Each burning deed and thought.","The village smithy stands under a spreading chestnut-tree. The smith is a mighty man, with large and sinewy hands, strong as iron bands. He earns whate'er he can, and owes not any man."
[I wandered lonely as a Cloud],"I wandered lonely as a Cloud
   That floats on high o’er Vales and Hills,
When all at once I saw a crowd,
   A host of golden Daffodils;
Beside the Lake, beneath the trees,
Fluttering and dancing in the breeze.
Continuous as the stars that shine
   And twinkle on the Milky Way,
They stretched in never-ending line
   Along the margin of a bay:
Ten thousand saw I at a glance,
Tossing their heads in sprightly dance.
The waves beside them danced, but they
   Out-did the sparkling waves in glee:—
A Poet could not but be gay
   In such a jocund company:
I gazed—and gazed—but little thought
What wealth the shew to me had brought:
For oft when on my couch I lie
   In vacant or in pensive mood,
They flash upon that inward eye
   Which is the bliss of solitude,
And then my heart with pleasure fills,
And dances with the Daffodils.",The poem was written in the first half of the 20th century. It is about a man who is lonely in the world. He is surrounded by a crowd of Daffodils.
I taste a liquor never brewed (214),"I taste a liquor never brewed – 
From Tankards scooped in Pearl – 
Not all the Frankfort Berries
Yield such an Alcohol!
Inebriate of air – am I – 
And Debauchee of Dew – 
Reeling – thro' endless summer days – 
From inns of molten Blue – 
When ""Landlords"" turn the drunken Bee
Out of the Foxglove's door – 
When Butterflies – renounce their ""drams"" – 
I shall but drink the more!

Dulce et Decorum Est,"Bent double, like old beggars under sacks,
Knock-kneed, coughing like hags, we cursed through sludge,
Till on the haunting flares we turned our backs
And towards our distant rest began to trudge.
Men marched asleep. Many had lost their boots
But limped on, blood-shod. All went lame; all blind;
Drunk with fatigue; deaf even to the hoots
Of tired, outstripped Five-Nines that dropped behind.
Gas! Gas! Quick, boys!—An ecstasy of fumbling,
Fitting the clumsy helmets just in time;
But someone still was yelling out and stumbling
And flound'ring like a man in fire or lime...
Dim, through the misty panes and thick green light,
As under a green sea, I saw him drowning.
In all my dreams, before my helpless sight,
He plunges at me, guttering, choking, drowning.
If in some smothering dreams you too could pace
Behind the wagon that we flung him in,
And watch the white eyes writhing in his face,
His hanging face, like a devil's sick of sin;
If you could hear, at every jolt, the blood
Come gargling from the froth-corrupted lungs,
Obscene as cancer, bitter as the cud
Of vile, incurable sores on innocent tongues,—
My friend, you would not tell with such high zest
To children ardent for some desperate glory,
The old Lie: Dulce et decorum est
Pro patria mori.","Men marched asleep. Many had lost their boots. All went lame; all blind; drunk with fatigue; deaf even to the hoots of tired, outstripped Five-Nines that dropped behind. The old Lie: Dulce et decorum estPro patria mori."
For the Fallen,"With proud thanksgiving, a mother for her children,
England mourns for her dead across the sea.
Flesh of her flesh they were, spirit of her spirit,
Fallen in the cause of the free.
Solemn the drums thrill: Death august and royal
Sings sorrow up into immortal spheres.
There is a music in the midst of desolation
And a glory that shines upon our tears.
They went with songs to the battle, they were young,
Straight of limb, true of eye, steady and aglow.
They were staunch to the end against odds uncountered:
They fell with their faces to the foe.
They shall grow not old, as we that are left grow old:
Age shall not weary them, nor the years condemn.
At the going down of the sun and in the morning
We will remember them.
They mingle not with their laughing comrades again;
They sit no more at familiar tables at home;
They have no lot in our labour of the day-time;
They sleep beyond England's foam.
But where our desires are and our hopes profound,
Felt as a well-spring that is hidden from sight,
To the innermost heart of their own land they are known
As the stars are known to the Night;
As the stars that shall be bright when we are dust,
Moving in marches upon the heavenly plain;
As the stars are starry in the time of our darkness,
To the end, to the end they remain.","England mourns for her dead across the sea. With proud thanksgiving, a mother for her children, England mourns. They went with songs to the battle, they were young, straight of limb, true of eye, steady and aglow."
Not to Keep,"They sent him back to her. The letter came
Saying... and she could have him. And before
She could be sure there was no hidden ill
Under the formal writing, he was in her sight—
Living.— They gave him back to her alive—
How else? They are not known to send the dead—
And not disfigured visibly. His face?—
His hands? She had to look—to ask,
“What was it, dear?” And she had given all
And still she had all—they had—they the lucky!
Wasn’t she glad now? Everything seemed won,
And all the rest for them permissible ease.
She had to ask, ""What was it, dear?""
                                                               “Enough,
Yet not enough. A bullet through and through,
High in the breast. Nothing but what good care
And medicine and rest—and you a week,
Can cure me of to go again.” The same
Grim giving to do over for them both.
She dared no more than ask him with her eyes
How was it with him for a second trial.
And with his eyes he asked her not to ask.
They had given him back to her, but not to keep. ","They sent him back to her. The letter came saying... and she could have him. She had to ask, ""What was it, dear?"""
"The Canterbury Tales, “The Nun’s Priest’s Tale” [Excerpt]","This Chanticleer stood high upon his toes,
Stretching his neck, and both his eyes did close,
And so did crow right loudly, for the nonce;
And Russel Fox, he started up at once,
And by the gorget grabbed our Chanticleer,
Flung him on back, and toward the wood did steer,
For there was no man who as yet pursued.
O destiny, you cannot be eschewed!
Alas, that Chanticleer flew from the beams!
Alas, his wife recked nothing of his dreams!
     This simple widow and her daughters two
Heard these hens cry and make so great ado,
And out of doors they started on the run
And saw the fox into the grove just gone,
Bearing in his mouth the cock away.
And then they cried, “Alas, and weladay!
Oh, the fox!” and after him they ran,
And after them, with staves, went many a man;
Ran Coll, our dog, and Talbot and Garland,
Ran cow and calf and even the very hogs,
So were they scared by barking of the dogs
And shouting men and women all did make,
They all ran so they thought their hearts would break.
And now, good men, I pray you hearken all.
     Behold how Fortune turns all suddenly
The hope and pride of even her enemy!
This cock, which now lay in the fox’s mouth,
In all his fear unto the fox did clack
And say: “Sir, were I you, as I should be,
Then would I say (as God may now help me!),
‘Turn back again, presumptuous peasants all!
A very pestilence upon you fall!
Now that I've gained here to this dark wood’s side,
In spite of you this cock shall here abide.
I’ll eat him, by my faith, and that anon!’”
The fox replied: “In faith, it shall be done!”
And as he spoke that word, all suddenly
This cock broke from his mouth, full cleverly,
And high upon a tree he flew anon.
And when the fox saw well that he was gone,
“Alas,” quoth he, “O Chanticleer, alas!
I have against you done a base trespass
Inasmuch as I made you afeared
When I seized you and brought you from the yard;
But, sir, I did it with no foul intent;
Come down, and I will tell you what I meant.
I’ll tell the truth to you, God help me so!
“Nay then,” said he, “beshrew us both, you know,
But first, beshrew myself, both blood and bones,
If you beguile me, having done so once,
You shall no more, with any flattery,
Cause me to sing and closeup either eye;
For he who shuts his eyes when he should see,
And wilfully, God let him ne’er be free!”
“Nay,” said the fox, “but God give him mischance
Who is so indiscreet in governance
He chatters when he ought to hold his peace.”
     But you that hold this tale a foolery,
As but about a fox, a cock, a hen,
Yet do not miss the moral, my good men.
For Saint Paul says that all that's written well
Is written down some useful truth to tell.
Then take the wheat and let the chaff lie still.
     And now, good God, and if it be Thy will,
As says Lord Christ, so make us all good men
And bring us into His high bliss. Amen.","The story of Russel Fox is told in the story of a fox and a cock. The fox grabs the cock from his mouth and flies off with it in his mouth. The cock crows after the fox, saying: “I’ll eat him, by my faith, and that anon!"""
The Creation,"And God stepped out on space,
And he looked around and said:
I'm lonely—
I'll make me a world.
And far as the eye of God could see
Darkness covered everything,
Blacker than a hundred midnights
Down in a cypress swamp.
Then God smiled,
And the light broke,
And the darkness rolled up on one side,
And the light stood shining on the other,
And God said: That's good!
Then God reached out and took the light in his hands,
And God rolled the light around in his hands
Until he made the sun;
And he set that sun a-blazing in the heavens.
And the light that was left from making the sun
God gathered it up in a shining ball
And flung it against the darkness,
Spangling the night with the moon and stars.
Then down between
The darkness and the light
He hurled the world;
And God said: That's good!
Then God himself stepped down—
And the sun was on his right hand,
And the moon was on his left;
The stars were clustered about his head,
And the earth was under his feet.
And God walked, and where he trod
His footsteps hollowed the valleys out
And bulged the mountains up.
Then he stopped and looked and saw
That the earth was hot and barren.
So God stepped over to the edge of the world
And he spat out the seven seas—
He batted his eyes, and the lightnings flashed—
He clapped his hands, and the thunders rolled—
And the waters above the earth came down,
The cooling waters came down.
Then the green grass sprouted,
And the little red flowers blossomed,
The pine tree pointed his finger to the sky,
And the oak spread out his arms,
The lakes cuddled down in the hollows of the ground,
And the rivers ran down to the sea;
And God smiled again,
And the rainbow appeared,
And curled itself around his shoulder.
Then God raised his arm and he waved his hand
Over the sea and over the land,
And he said: Bring forth! Bring forth!
And quicker than God could drop his hand,
Fishes and fowls
And beasts and birds
Swam the rivers and the seas,
Roamed the forests and the woods,
And split the air with their wings.
And God said: That's good!
Then God walked around,
And God looked around
On all that he had made.
He looked at his sun,
And he looked at his moon,
And he looked at his little stars;
He looked on his world
With all its living things,
And God said: I'm lonely still.
Then God sat down—
On the side of a hill where he could think;
By a deep, wide river he sat down;
With his head in his hands,
God thought and thought,
Till he thought: I'll make me a man!
Up from the bed of the river
God scooped the clay;
And by the bank of the river
He kneeled him down;
And there the great God Almighty
Who lit the sun and fixed it in the sky,
Who flung the stars to the most far corner of the night,
Who rounded the earth in the middle of his hand;
This great God,
Like a mammy bending over her baby,
Kneeled down in the dust
Toiling over a lump of clay
Till he shaped it in is his own image;
Then into it he blew the breath of life,
And man became a living soul.
Amen.      Amen.","God said: ""I'll make me a world. And God stepped out on space, and he looked around and said: I'm lonely"" God made the sun, the moon, the stars, and the earth. He hurled the world into space."
Dream Song 1,"Huffy Henry hid    the day,

It was the thought that they thought
they could do it made Henry wicked & away.
But he should have come out and talked.
All the world like a woolen lover
once did seem on Henry's side.
Then came a departure.
Thereafter nothing fell out as it might or ought.
I don't see how Henry, pried
open for all the world to see, survived.
What he has now to say is a long
wonder the world can bear & be.

all at the top, and I sang.
Hard on the land wears the strong sea
and empty grows every bed.","Huffy Henry hid    the day, the unappeasable Henry sulked. The thought that they thought they could do it made Henry wicked & away."

So was it when my life began;

A Far Cry from Africa,"A wind is ruffling the tawny pelt
Of Africa. Kikuyu, quick as flies,
Batten upon the bloodstreams of the veldt.
Corpses are scattered through a paradise.
Only the worm, colonel of carrion, cries:
""Waste no compassion on these separate dead!""
Statistics justify and scholars seize
The salients of colonial policy.
What is that to the white child hacked in bed?
To savages, expendable as Jews?
Threshed out by beaters, the long rushes break
In a white dust of ibises whose cries
Have wheeled since civilization's dawn
From the parched river or beast-teeming plain.
The violence of beast on beast is read
As natural law, but upright man
Seeks his divinity by inflicting pain.
Delirious as these worried beasts, his wars
Dance to the tightened carcass of a drum,
While he calls courage still that native dread
Of the white peace contracted by the dead.
Again brutish necessity wipes its hands
Upon the napkin of a dirty cause, again
A waste of our compassion, as with Spain,
The gorilla wrestles with the superman.
I who am poisoned with the blood of both,
Where shall I turn, divided to the vein?
I who have cursed
The drunken officer of British rule, how choose
Between this Africa and the English tongue I love?
Betray them both, or give back what they give?
How can I face such slaughter and be cool?
How can I turn from Africa and live?","The gorilla wrestles with the superman. The violence of beast on beast is read as natural law, but upright man inflict pain by inflicting pain.

There Will Come Soft Rains,"(War Time)
There will come soft rains and the smell of the ground,
And swallows circling with their shimmering sound;
And frogs in the pools singing at night,
And wild plum trees in tremulous white,
Robins will wear their feathery fire
Whistling their whims on a low fence-wire;
And not one will know of the war, not one
Will care at last when it is done.
Not one would mind, neither bird nor tree
If mankind perished utterly;
And Spring herself, when she woke at dawn,
Would scarcely know that we were gone.","There will come soft rains and the smell of the ground, swallows circling with their shimmering sound, frogs in the pools singing at night, wild plum trees in tremulous white. Not one will know of the war, not one will care at last when it is done."
"somewhere i have never travelled,gladly beyond","somewhere i have never travelled, gladly beyond
any experience, your eyes have their silence:
in your most frail gesture are things which enclose me,
or which i cannot touch because they are too near
your slightest look easily will unclose me
though i have closed myself as fingers,
you open always petal by petal myself as Spring opens
(touching skillfully, mysteriously) her first rose
or if your wish be to close me, i and
my life will shut very beautifully, suddenly,
as when the heart of this flower imagines
the snow carefully everywhere descending;
nothing which we are to perceive in this world equals
the power of your intense fragility: whose texture
compels me with the colour of its countries,
rendering death and forever with each breathing
(i do not know what it is about you that closes
and opens; only something in me understands
the voice of your eyes is deeper than all roses)
nobody, not even the rain, has such small hands","""If your wish be to close me, i and my life will shut very beautifully, suddenly, suddenly"" ""The voice of your eyes is deeper than all roses"" ""You open always petal by petal myself as Spring opens"""
Hope is the thing with feathers (254),"Hope is the thing with feathers
That perches in the soul,
And sings the tune without the words,
And never stops at all,
And sweetest in the gale is heard;
And sore must be the storm
That could abash the little bird
That kept so many warm.
I've heard it in the chillest land,
And on the strangest sea;
Yet, never, in extremity,
It asked a crumb of me.","Hope is the thing with feathers that perches in the soul, and sings the tune without the words. I've heard it in the chillest land,                And on the strangest sea;                Yet, never, in extremity, has it asked a crumb of me."
Remember,"Remember the sky that you were born under,
know each of the star’s stories.
Remember the moon, know who she is.
Remember the sun’s birth at dawn, that is the
strongest point of time. Remember sundown
and the giving away to night.
Remember your birth, how your mother struggled
to give you form and breath. You are evidence of
her life, and her mother’s, and hers.
Remember your father. He is your life, also.
Remember the earth whose skin you are:
red earth, black earth, yellow earth, white earth
brown earth, we are earth.
Remember the plants, trees, animal life who all have their
tribes, their families, their histories, too. Talk to them,
listen to them. They are alive poems.
Remember the wind. Remember her voice. She knows the
origin of this universe.
Remember you are all people and all people
are you.
Remember you are this universe and this
universe is you.
Remember all is in motion, is growing, is you.
Remember language comes from this.

Diving into the Wreck,"First having read the book of myths,
and loaded the camera,
and checked the edge of the knife-blade,
I put on
the body-armor of black rubber
the absurd flippers
the grave and awkward mask.
I am having to do this
not like Cousteau with his
assiduous team
aboard the sun-flooded schooner
but here alone.
There is a ladder.
The ladder is always there
hanging innocently
close to the side of the schooner.
We know what it is for,
we who have used it.
Otherwise
it is a piece of maritime floss
some sundry equipment.
I go down.
Rung after rung and still
the oxygen immerses me
the blue light
the clear atoms
of our human air.
I go down.
My flippers cripple me,
I crawl like an insect down the ladder
and there is no one
to tell me when the ocean
will begin.
First the air is blue and then
it is bluer and then green and then
black I am blacking out and yet
my mask is powerful
it pumps my blood with power
the sea is another story
the sea is not a question of power
I have to learn alone
to turn my body without force
in the deep element.
And now: it is easy to forget
what I came for
among so many who have always
lived here
swaying their crenellated fans
between the reefs
and besides
you breathe differently down here.
I came to explore the wreck.
The words are purposes.
The words are maps.
I came to see the damage that was done
and the treasures that prevail.
I stroke the beam of my lamp
slowly along the flank
of something more permanent
than fish or weed
the thing I came for:
the wreck and not the story of the wreck
the thing itself and not the myth
the drowned face always staring
toward the sun
the evidence of damage
worn by salt and sway into this threadbare beauty
the ribs of the disaster
curving their assertion
among the tentative haunters.
This is the place.
And I am here, the mermaid whose dark hair
streams black, the merman in his armored body.
We circle silently
about the wreck
we dive into the hold.
I am she: I am he
whose drowned face sleeps with open eyes
whose breasts still bear the stress
whose silver, copper, vermeil cargo lies
obscurely inside barrels
half-wedged and left to rot
we are the half-destroyed instruments
that once held to a course
the water-eaten log
the fouled compass
We are, I am, you are
by cowardice or courage
the one who find our way
back to this scene
carrying a knife, a camera
a book of myths
in which
our names do not appear.","""I came to explore the wreck. I came to see the damage that was done and the treasures that prevail"" ""I am here, the mermaid whose dark hairstreams black, the merman in his armored body"""
A Time to Talk,"When a friend calls to me from the road
And slows his horse to a meaning walk,
I don’t stand still and look around
On all the hills I haven’t hoed,
And shout from where I am, What is it?
No, not as there is a time to talk.
I thrust my hoe in the mellow ground,
Blade-end up and five feet tall,
And plod: I go up to the stone wall
For a friendly visit.","When a friend calls to me from the road, I don't stand still and look around. I thrust my hoe in the mellow ground,Blade-end up and five feet tall,And plod: I go up to the stone wall."
On Pain,"And a woman spoke, saying, Tell us of Pain.
     And he said:
     Your pain is the breaking of the shell that encloses your understanding.
     Even as the stone of the fruit must break, that its heart may stand in the sun, so must you know pain.
     And could you keep your heart in wonder at the daily miracles of your life your pain would not seem less wondrous than your joy;
     And you would accept the seasons of your heart, even as you have always accepted the seasons that pass over your fields.
     And you would watch with serenity through the winters of your grief.

     Much of your pain is self-chosen.
     It is the bitter potion by which the physician within you heals your sick self.
     Therefore trust the physician, and drink his remedy in silence and tranquility:
     For his hand, though heavy and hard, is guided by the tender hand of the Unseen,
     And the cup he brings, though it burn your lips, has been fashioned of the clay which the Potter has moistened with His own sacred tears. ",Pain is the breaking of the shell that encloses your understanding. Much of your pain is self-chosen. It is the bitter potion by which the physician within you heals your sick self.
"In the chemo room, I wear mittens made of ice so I don’t lose my fingernails. But I took a risk today to write this down.","Whenever I spend the day crying, 
my friends tell me I look high. Good grief,  
they finally understand me.  
Even when the arena is empty, I thank god  
for the shots I miss. If you ever catch me  
only thanking god for the shots I make,  
remind me I’m not thanking god. Remind me  
all my prayers were answered  
the moment I started praying  
for what I already have.  
Jenny says when people ask if she’s out of the woods,  
she tells them she’ll never be out of the woods,  
says there is something lovely about the woods.  
I know how to build a survival shelter  
from fallen tree branches, packed mud,  
and pulled moss. I could survive forever  
on death alone. Wasn’t it death that taught me  
to stop measuring my lifespan by length,
but by width? Do you know how many beautiful things  
can be seen in a single second? How you can blow up
a second like a balloon and fit infinity inside of it? 
I’m infinite, I know, but I still have a measly wrinkle
collection compared to my end goal. I would love  
to be a before picture, I think, as I look in the mirror
and mistake my head for the moon. My dark  
thoughts are almost always 238,856 miles away 
from me believing them. I love this life, 
I whisper into my doctor’s stethoscope
so she can hear my heart. My heart, an heirloom
I didn’t inherit until I thought I could die.
Why did I go so long believing I owed the world
my disappointment? Why did I want to take
the world by storm when I could have taken it
by sunshine, by rosewater, by the cactus flowers
on the side of the road where I broke down?
I’m not about to waste more time
spinning stories about how much time
I’m owed, but there is a man
who is usually here, who isn’t today.  
I don’t know if he’s still alive. I just know
his wife was made of so much hope  
she looked like a firework above his chair.
Will the afterlife be harder if I remember
the people I love, or forget them?
Either way, please let me remember.","I love this life, I whisper into my doctor’s stethoscope so she can hear my heart. My heart, an heirloomI didn’t inherit until I thought I could die. Why did I want to take the world by storm when I could have taken it by sunshine, by rosewater, by the cactus flowers on the side of the road where I broke down?"
Trees,"I think that I shall never see
A poem lovely as a tree.
A tree whose hungry mouth is prest
Against the earth's sweet flowing breast;
A tree that looks at God all day,
And lifts her leafy arms to pray;
A tree that may in summer wear
A nest of robins in her hair;
Upon whose bosom snow has lain;
Who intimately lives with rain.
Poems are made by fools like me,
But only God can make a tree.","A tree that may in summer wear a nest of robins in her hair. A tree that looks at God all day, and lifts her leafy arms to pray."
On the Pulse of Morning,"A Rock, A River, A Tree
Hosts to species long since departed,
Marked the mastodon,
The dinosaur, who left dried tokens
Of their sojourn here
On our planet floor,
Any broad alarm of their hastening doom
Is lost in the gloom of dust and ages.
But today, the Rock cries out to us, clearly, forcefully,
Come, you may stand upon my
Back and face your distant destiny,
But seek no haven in my shadow.
I will give you no hiding place down here.
You, created only a little lower than
The angels, have crouched too long in
The bruising darkness
Have lain too long
Face down in ignorance.
Your mouths spilling words
Armed for slaughter.
The Rock cries out to us today, you may stand upon me,
But do not hide your face.
Across the wall of the world,
A River sings a beautiful song. It says,
Come, rest here by my side.
Each of you, a bordered country,
Delicate and strangely made proud,
Yet thrusting perpetually under siege.
Your armed struggles for profit
Have left collars of waste upon
My shore, currents of debris upon my breast.
Yet today I call you to my riverside,
If you will study war no more. Come,
Clad in peace, and I will sing the songs
The Creator gave to me when I and the
Tree and the rock were one.
Before cynicism was a bloody sear across your
Brow and when you yet knew you still
Knew nothing.
The River sang and sings on.
There is a true yearning to respond to
The singing River and the wise Rock.
So say the Asian, the Hispanic, the Jew
The African, the Native American, the Sioux,
The Catholic, the Muslim, the French, the Greek
The Irish, the Rabbi, the Priest, the Sheik,
The Gay, the Straight, the Preacher,
The privileged, the homeless, the Teacher.
They hear. They all hear
The speaking of the Tree.
They hear the first and last of every Tree
Speak to humankind today. Come to me, here beside the River.
Plant yourself beside the River.
Each of you, descendant of some passed
On traveller, has been paid for.
You, who gave me my first name, you,
Pawnee, Apache, Seneca, you
Cherokee Nation, who rested with me, then
Forced on bloody feet,
Left me to the employment of
Other seekers—desperate for gain,
Starving for gold.
You, the Turk, the Arab, the Swede, the German, the Eskimo, the Scot,
You the Ashanti, the Yoruba, the Kru, bought,
Sold, stolen, arriving on the nightmare
Praying for a dream.
Here, root yourselves beside me.
I am that Tree planted by the River,
Which will not be moved.
I, the Rock, I the River, I the Tree
I am yours—your passages have been paid.
Lift up your faces, you have a piercing need
For this bright morning dawning for you.
History, despite its wrenching pain
Cannot be unlived, but if faced
With courage, need not be lived again.
Lift up your eyes upon
This day breaking for you.
Give birth again
To the dream.
Women, children, men,
Take it into the palms of your hands,
Mold it into the shape of your most
Private need. Sculpt it into
The image of your most public self.
Lift up your hearts
Each new hour holds new chances
For a new beginning.
Do not be wedded forever
To fear, yoked eternally
To brutishness.
The horizon leans forward,
Offering you space to place new steps of change.
Here, on the pulse of this fine day
You may have the courage
To look up and out and upon me, the
Rock, the River, the Tree, your country.
No less to Midas than the mendicant.
No less to you now than the mastodon then.
Here, on the pulse of this new day
You may have the grace to look up and out
And into your sister’s eyes, and into
Your brother’s face, your country
And say simply
Very simply
With hope—
Good morning.","A Rock, A River, A Tree, hosts species long since departed, including the mastodon. The Rock cries out to us today, you may stand upon me, but do not hide your face. The River sings a beautiful song."
Good Bones,"Life is short, though I keep this from my children.
Life is short, and I’ve shortened mine
in a thousand delicious, ill-advised ways,
a thousand deliciously ill-advised ways
I’ll keep from my children. The world is at least
fifty percent terrible, and that’s a conservative
estimate, though I keep this from my children.
For every bird there is a stone thrown at a bird.
For every loved child, a child broken, bagged,
sunk in a lake. Life is short and the world
is at least half terrible, and for every kind
stranger, there is one who would break you,
though I keep this from my children. I am trying
to sell them the world. Any decent realtor,
walking you through a real shithole, chirps on
about good bones: This place could be beautiful,
right? You could make this place beautiful.","Life is short, and I’ve shortened mine in a thousand delicious, ill-advised ways. The world is at least half terrible, and for every kind of stranger, there is one who would break you. I am trying to sell them the world."
So we'll go no more a roving,"So, we'll go no more a roving
    So late into the night,
Though the heart be still as loving,
    And the moon be still as bright.

For the sword outwears its sheath,
    And the soul wears out the breast,
And the heart must pause to breathe,
    And love itself have rest.

Though the night was made for loving,
    And the day returns too soon,
Yet we'll go no more a roving
    By the light of the moon.","""So late into the night, though the heart be still as loving, and the moon still as bright, we'll go no more a roving by the light of the moon"""
To the Sea,"Sometimes when you start to ramble
or rather when you feel you are starting to ramble
you will say Well, now I’m rambling
though I don’t think you ever are.
And if you ever are I don’t really care.
And not just because I and everyone really 
at times falls into our own unspooling
—which really I think is a beautiful softness
of being human, trying to show someone else
the color of all our threads, wanting another to know 
everything in us we are trying to show them—
but in the specific, 
in the specific of you
here in this car that you are driving
and in which I am sitting beside you
with regards to you 
and your specific mouth
parting to give way
to the specific sweetness that is
the water of your voice 
tumbling forth—like I said 
I don’t ever really mind
how much more 
you might keep speaking
as it simply means 
I get to hear you 
speak for longer. 
What was a stream 
now a river.","I don’t ever really mind how much more  hypertrophicyou might keep speaking, as it simply means I get to hear you speak for longer. The water of your voice is a beautiful softness of being human."
Enough,"You are enough
Divinity flows in your fingertips
        with light so radiant
        every beat of your heart
a victory march
made of whole universes
        stitched by the hands of creation
        with flawless design
a prophecy You fulfill perfectly with every breath
        You
The sun wouldn’t shine the same without it
Creation is only waiting for You
                to smile back at it
Do you see it yet?
You are enough
        For the birds to sing about
        For the seeds to sprout about
        For the stars to shoot about
        Do you see it yet?
        Gardens in your speech
Fields of wildflowers in your prayers
        Lighthouses in your eyes
    No one else can see it for you
You have always been enough
You will always be enough
Your simple act of being is enough
            Do you see it yet?",You fulfill perfectly with every breath. The sun wouldn’t shine the same without it. Creation is only waiting for You to smile back at it. You are enough.
The Soul has Bandaged moments (360),"The Soul has Bandaged moments –
When too appalled to stir –
She feels some ghastly Fright come up
And stop to look at her –
Salute her, with long fingers –
Caress her freezing hair –
Sip, Goblin, from the very lips
The Lover – hovered – o’er –
Unworthy, that a thought so mean
Accost a Theme – so – fair ­–
The soul has moments of escape –
When bursting all the doors –
She dances like a Bomb, abroad,
And swings opon the Hours,
As do the Bee – delirious borne –
Long Dungeoned from his Rose –
Touch Liberty – then know no more,
But Noon, and Paradise –
The Soul’s retaken moments –
When, Felon led along,
With shackles on the plumed feet,
And staples, in the song,
The Horror welcomes her, again,
These, are not brayed of Tongue –","The Soul has Bandaged moments – when too appalled to stir – when some ghastly Fright come up. The Lover – hovered – o’er – unworthy, that a thought so mean could be so mean."
Fern Hill,"Now as I was young and easy under the apple boughs
About the lilting house and happy as the grass was green,
     The night above the dingle starry,
          Time let me hail and climb
     Golden in the heydays of his eyes,
And honoured among wagons I was prince of the apple towns
And once below a time I lordly had the trees and leaves
          Trail with daisies and barley
     Down the rivers of the windfall light.
And as I was green and carefree, famous among the barns
About the happy yard and singing as the farm was home,
     In the sun that is young once only,
          Time let me play and be
     Golden in the mercy of his means,
And green and golden I was huntsman and herdsman, the calves
Sang to my horn, the foxes on the hills barked clear and cold,
          And the sabbath rang slowly
     In the pebbles of the holy streams.
All the sun long it was running, it was lovely, the hay
Fields high as the house, the tunes from the chimneys, it was air
     And playing, lovely and watery
          And fire green as grass.
     And nightly under the simple stars
As I rode to sleep the owls were bearing the farm away,
All the moon long I heard, blessed among stables, the nightjars
     Flying with the ricks, and the horses
          Flashing into the dark.
And then to awake, and the farm, like a wanderer white
With the dew, come back, the cock on his shoulder: it was all
     Shining, it was Adam and maiden,
          The sky gathered again
     And the sun grew round that very day.
So it must have been after the birth of the simple light
In the first, spinning place, the spellbound horses walking warm
     Out of the whinnying green stable
          On to the fields of praise.
And honoured among foxes and pheasants by the gay house
Under the new made clouds and happy as the heart was long,
     In the sun born over and over,
          I ran my heedless ways,
     My wishes raced through the house high hay
And nothing I cared, at my sky blue trades, that time allows
In all his tuneful turning so few and such morning songs
     Before the children green and golden
          Follow him out of grace,
Nothing I cared, in the lamb white days, that time would take me
Up to the swallow thronged loft by the shadow of my hand,
     In the moon that is always rising,
          Nor that riding to sleep
     I should hear him fly with the high fields
And wake to the farm forever fled from the childless land.
Oh as I was young and easy in the mercy of his means,
          Time held me green and dying
     Though I sang in my chains like the sea.","As I was young and easy under the apple boughs and happy as the grass was green, I was a huntsman and herdsman. The foxes on the hills barked clear and cold, and the sabbath rang slowly in the pebbles."

Tea at the Palaz of Hoon,"Not less because in purple I descended
The western day through what you called
The loneliest air, not less was I myself.

What was the ointment sprinkled on my beard?
What were the hymns that buzzed beside my ears?
What was the sea whose tide swept through me there?

Out of my mind the golden ointment rained,
And my ears made the blowing hymns they heard.
I was myself the compass of that sea:

I was the world in which I walked, and what I saw
Or heard or felt came not but from myself;
And there I found myself more truly and more strange.",In purple I descended through the western day through what you called 'the loneliest air' Not less was I myself. I was myself the compass of that sea. What I saw or heard or felt came not but from myself.
The Unknown Citizen,"(To JS/07 M 378
This Marble Monument
Is Erected by the State)
He was found by the Bureau of Statistics to be
One against whom there was no official complaint,
And all the reports on his conduct agree
That, in the modern sense of an old-fashioned word, he was a saint,
For in everything he did he served the Greater Community.
Except for the War till the day he retired
He worked in a factory and never got fired,
But satisfied his employers, Fudge Motors Inc.
Yet he wasn't a scab or odd in his views,
For his Union reports that he paid his dues,
(Our report on his Union shows it was sound)
And our Social Psychology workers found
That he was popular with his mates and liked a drink.
The Press are convinced that he bought a paper every day
And that his reactions to advertisements were normal in every way.
Policies taken out in his name prove that he was fully insured,
And his Health-card shows he was once in hospital but left it cured.
Both Producers Research and High-Grade Living declare
He was fully sensible to the advantages of the Instalment Plan
And had everything necessary to the Modern Man,
A phonograph, a radio, a car and a frigidaire.
Our researchers into Public Opinion are content
That he held the proper opinions for the time of year;
When there was peace, he was for peace: when there was war, he went.
He was married and added five children to the population,
Which our Eugenist says was the right number for a parent of his generation.
And our teachers report that he never interfered with their education.
Was he free? Was he happy? The question is absurd:
Had anything been wrong, we should certainly have heard.","He was found by the Bureau of Statistics to be one against whom there was no official complaint. He worked in a factory and never got fired, satisfied his employers, Fudge Motors Inc."
Love is Not All (Sonnet XXX),"Love is not all: it is not meat nor drink
Nor slumber nor a roof against the rain; 
Nor yet a floating spar to men that sink 
And rise and sink and rise and sink again; 
Love can not fill the thickened lung with breath, 
Nor clean the blood, nor set the fractured bone; 
Yet many a man is making friends with death 
Even as I speak, for lack of love alone. 
It well may be that in a difficult hour, 
Pinned down by pain and moaning for release, 
Or nagged by want past resolution’s power, 
I might be driven to sell your love for peace, 
Or trade the memory of this night for food. 
It well may be. I do not think I would. ","Love is not all: it is not meat nor drink nor slumber nor a roof against the rain. Love can not fill the thickened lung with breath, nor clean the blood, nor set the fractured bone. Many a man is making friends with death, for lack of love alone."
What the Living Do,"Johnny, the kitchen sink has been clogged for days, some utensil probably fell down there.
And the Drano won’t work but smells dangerous, and the crusty dishes have piled up
waiting for the plumber I still haven’t called. This is the everyday we spoke of.
It’s winter again: the sky’s a deep, headstrong blue, and the sunlight pours through
the open living-room windows because the heat’s on too high in here and I can’t turn it off.
For weeks now, driving, or dropping a bag of groceries in the street, the bag breaking,
I’ve been thinking: This is what the living do. And yesterday, hurrying along those
wobbly bricks in the Cambridge sidewalk, spilling my coffee down my wrist and sleeve,
I thought it again, and again later, when buying a hairbrush: This is it.
Parking. Slamming the car door shut in the cold. What you called that yearning.
What you finally gave up. We want the spring to come and the winter to pass. We want
whoever to call or not call, a letter, a kiss—we want more and more and then more of it.
But there are moments, walking, when I catch a glimpse of myself in the window glass,
say, the window of the corner video store, and I'm gripped by a cherishing so deep
for my own blowing hair, chapped face, and unbuttoned coat that I’m speechless:
I am living. I remember you.","This is the everyday we spoke of. Johnny, the kitchen sink has been clogged for days, some utensil probably fell down there.

The Tyger,"Tyger! Tyger! burning bright
In the forests of the night,
What immortal hand or eye
Could frame thy fearful symmetry?
In what distant deeps or skies
Burnt the fire of thine eyes?
On what wings dare he aspire?
What the hand, dare sieze the fire?
And what shoulder, & what art,
Could twist the sinews of thy heart?
And when thy heart began to beat,
What dread hand? & what dread feet?
What the hammer? what the chain?
In what furnace was thy brain?
What the anvil? what dread grasp
Dare its deadly terrors clasp?
When the stars threw down their spears,
And water'd heaven with their tears,
Did he smile his work to see?
Did he who made the Lamb make thee?
Tyger! Tyger! burning bright

Dare frame thy fearful symmetry?","Tyger! Tyger! burning bright. In the forests of the night, what immortal hand or eye could frame thy fearful symmetry? In what distant deeps or skiesBurnt the fire of thine eyes? On what wings dare he aspire?"
Annabel Lee,"It was many and many a year ago,
   In a kingdom by the sea,
That a maiden there lived whom you may know
   By the name of Annabel Lee;
And this maiden she lived with no other thought
   Than to love and be loved by me.
I was a child and she was a child,
   In this kingdom by the sea:
But we loved with a love that was more than love—
   I and my Annabel Lee;
With a love that the winged seraphs of heaven
   Coveted her and me.
And this was the reason that, long ago,
   In this kingdom by the sea,
A wind blew out of a cloud, chilling
   My beautiful Annabel Lee;
So that her highborn kinsman came
   And bore her away from me,
To shut her up in a sepulchre
   In this kingdom by the sea.
The angels, not half so happy in heaven,
   Went envying her and me—
Yes!—that was the reason (as all men know,
   In this kingdom by the sea)
That the wind came out of the cloud by night,
   Chilling and killing my Annabel Lee.
But our love it was stronger by far than the love
   Of those who were older than we—
   Of many far wiser than we—
And neither the angels in heaven above,
   Nor the demons down under the sea,
Can ever dissever my soul from the soul
   Of the beautiful Annabel Lee:
For the moon never beams, without bringing me dreams
   Of the beautiful Annabel Lee;
And the stars never rise, but I feel the bright eyes
   Of the beautiful Annabel Lee;
And so, all the night-tide, I lie down by the side
Of my darling—my darling—my life and my bride,
   In her sepulchre there by the sea,
   In her tomb by the sounding sea.","A year ago, in a kingdom by the sea, a maiden there lived whom you may know by the name of Annabel Lee. She lived with no other thought than to love and be loved by me. The angels, not half so happy in heaven, went envying her and me."
When Giving Is All We Have,"                                              One river gives
                                              Its journey to the next.
We give because someone gave to us.
We give because nobody gave to us.
We give because giving has changed us.
We give because giving could have changed us.
We have been better for it,
We have been wounded by it—
Giving has many faces: It is loud and quiet,
Big, though small, diamond in wood-nails.
Its story is old, the plot worn and the pages too,
But we read this book, anyway, over and again:
Giving is, first and every time, hand to hand,
Mine to yours, yours to mine.
You gave me blue and I gave you yellow.
Together we are simple green. You gave me
What you did not have, and I gave you
What I had to give—together, we made
Something greater from the difference.
 ","Giving is, first and every time, hand to hand, mine to yours, yours to mine. You gave me blue and I gave you yellow. Together, we made something greater from the difference. We give because giving has changed us."

What could such glory be
if not a heart? Oh my brothers and sisters,

permit yourselves
to open once, who would never
open again? Because in truth
I am speaking now

Sick,"""I cannot go to school today,""
Said little Peggy Ann McKay.
""I have the measles and the mumps,
A gash, a rash and purple bumps.
My mouth is wet, my throat is dry,
I'm going blind in my right eye.
My tonsils are as big as rocks,
I've counted sixteen chicken pox
And there's one more—that's seventeen,
And don't you think my face looks green?
My leg is cut—my eyes are blue—
It might be instamatic flu.
I cough and sneeze and gasp and choke,
I'm sure that my left leg is broke—
My hip hurts when I move my chin,
My belly button's caving in,
My back is wrenched, my ankle's sprained,
My 'pendix pains each time it rains.
My nose is cold, my toes are numb.
I have a sliver in my thumb.
My neck is stiff, my voice is weak,
I hardly whisper when I speak.
My tongue is filling up my mouth,
I think my hair is falling out.
My elbow's bent, my spine ain't straight,
My temperature is one-o-eight.
My brain is shrunk, I cannot hear,
There is a hole inside my ear.
I have a hangnail, and my heart is—what?

You say today is. . .Saturday?

O Captain! My Captain!,"O Captain! my Captain! our fearful trip is done,
The ship has weather’d every rack, the prize we sought is won,
The port is near, the bells I hear, the people all exulting,
While follow eyes the steady keel, the vessel grim and daring;
       But O heart! heart! heart!
         O the bleeding drops of red,
           Where on the deck my Captain lies,
             Fallen cold and dead.
O Captain! my Captain! rise up and hear the bells;
Rise up- for you the flag is flung- for you the bugle trills,
For you bouquets and ribbon’d wreaths- for you the shores a-crowding,
For you they call, the swaying mass, their eager faces turning;
       Here Captain! dear father!
         This arm beneath your head!
           It is some dream that on the deck,
             You’ve fallen cold and dead.
My Captain does not answer, his lips are pale and still,
My father does not feel my arm, he has no pulse nor will,
The ship is anchor’d safe and sound, its voyage closed and done,

"Julius Caesar, Act III, Scene I [O, pardon me, thou bleeding piece of earth]","Antony speaks over Caesar's body

O, pardon me, thou bleeding piece of earth,
That I am meek and gentle with these butchers!
Thou art the ruins of the noblest man
That ever lived in the tide of times.
Woe to the hand that shed this costly blood!
Over thy wounds now do I prophesy,—
Which, like dumb mouths, do ope their ruby lips,
To beg the voice and utterance of my tongue—
A curse shall light upon the limbs of men;
Domestic fury and fierce civil strife
Shall cumber all the parts of Italy;
Blood and destruction shall be so in use
And dreadful objects so familiar
That mothers shall but smile when they behold
Their infants quarter'd with the hands of war;
All pity choked with custom of fell deeds:
And Caesar's spirit, ranging for revenge,
With Ate by his side come hot from hell,
Shall in these confines with a monarch's voice
Cry 'Havoc,' and let slip the dogs of war;
That this foul deed shall smell above the earth
With carrion men, groaning for burial.","Antony speaks over Caesar's body. Antony: ""O, pardon me, thou bleeding piece of earth, that I am meek and gentle with these butchers!"""
The Kraken,"Below the thunders of the upper deep,
Far, far beneath in the abysmal sea,
His ancient, dreamless, uninvaded sleep
The Kraken sleepeth: faintest sunlights flee
About his shadowy sides; above him swell
Huge sponges of millennial growth and height;
And far away into the sickly light,
From many a wondrous grot and secret cell
Unnumbered and enormous polypi
Winnow with giant arms the slumbering green.
There hath he lain for ages, and will lie
Battening upon huge sea worms in his sleep,
Until the latter fire shall heat the deep;
Then once by man and angels to be seen,
In roaring he shall rise and on the surface die.","The Kraken sleeps in an ancient, dreamless, uninvaded sleep. He will lie battling upon huge sea worms in his sleep, until the latter fire shall heat the deep. Then he will rise and on the surface die."
The Anactoria Poem,"Some say thronging cavalry, some say foot soldiers, 
others call a fleet the most beautiful of 
sights the dark earth offers, but I say it's what-
            ever you love best.

And it's easy to make this understood by 
everyone, for she who surpassed all human 
kind in beauty, Helen, abandoning her
            husband—that best of

men—went sailing off to the shores of Troy and 
never spent a thought on her child or loving 
parents: when the goddess seduced her wits and
            left her to wander,

she forgot them all, she could not remember 
anything but longing, and lightly straying 
aside, lost her way. But that reminds me
            now: Anactória,

she's not here, and I'd rather see her lovely 
step, her sparkling glance and her face than gaze on
all the troops in Lydia in their chariots and
            glittering armor.","Helen, abandoning her husband, went sailing off to the shores of Troy and never spent a thought on her child or loving parents. When the goddess seduced her wits and left her to wander, she forgot them all, she could not remember anything but longing."

Epitaph to a Dog,"Near this Spot
are deposited the Remains of one
who possessed Beauty without Vanity,
Strength without Insolence,
Courage without Ferosity,
and all the virtues of Man without his Vices.
This praise, which would be unmeaning Flattery
if inscribed over human Ashes,
is but a just tribute to the Memory of
BOATSWAIN, a DOG,
who was born in Newfoundland May 1803
and died at Newstead Nov. 18th, 1808.
When some proud Son of Man returns to Earth,
Unknown to Glory but upheld by Birth,
The sculptor's art exhausts the pomp of woe,
And storied urns record who rests below:
When all is done, upon the Tomb is seen
Not what he was, but what he should have been.
But the poor Dog, in life the firmest friend,
The first to welcome, foremost to defend,
Whose honest heart is still his Master's own,
Who labours, fights, lives, breathes for him alone,
Unhonour'd falls, unnotic'd all his worth,
Deny'd in heaven the Soul he held on earth:
While man, vain insect! hopes to be forgiven,
And claims himself a sole exclusive heaven.
Oh man! thou feeble tenant of an hour,
Debas'd by slavery, or corrupt by power,
Who knows thee well, must quit thee with disgust,
Degraded mass of animated dust!
Thy love is lust, thy friendship all a cheat,
Thy tongue hypocrisy, thy heart deceit!
By nature vile, ennobled but by name,
Each kindred brute might bid thee blush for shame.
Ye! who behold perchance this simple urn,
Pass on, it honors none you wish to mourn.
To mark a friend's remains these stones arise;
I never knew but one—and here he lies.","Near this Spot are deposited the Remains of one who possessed Beauty without Vanity,Strength without Insolence,Courage without Ferosity, and all the virtues of Man without his Vices.

"The Aeneid, Book I, [Arms and the man I sing]","Arms and the man I sing, who, forced by fate
And haughty Juno's unrelenting hate,
Expelled and exiled, left the Trojan shore.
Long labors, both by sea and land, he bore;
And in the doubtful war, before he won
The Latin realm and built the destined town,
His banished gods restored to rights divine,
And settled sure succession in his line;
From whence the race of Alban fathers come,
And the long glories of majestic Rome.
     O Muse! the causes and the crimes relate,—
What goddess was provok'd, and whence her hate;
For what offense the Queen of Heav'n began
To persecute so brave, so just a man;
Involv'd his anxious life in endless cares,
Expos'd to wants, and hurried into wars!
Can heav'nly minds such high resentment show,
Or exercise their spite in human woe?
     Against the Tiber's mouth, but far away,
An ancient town was seated on the sea,—
A Tyrian colony; the people made
Stout for the war, and studious of their trade:
Carthage the name; belov'd by Juno more
Than her own Argos, or the Samian shore.
Here stood her chariot; here, if Heav'n were kind,
The seat of awful empire she design'd.
Yet she had heard an ancient rumor fly,
(Long cited by the people of the sky,)
That times to come should see the Trojan race
Her Carthage ruin, and her tow'rs deface;
Nor thus confin'd, the yoke of sov'reign sway
Should on the necks of all the nations lay.
She ponder'd this, and fear'd it was in fate;
Nor could forget the war she wag'd of late
For conqu'ring Greece against the Trojan state.
Besides, long causes working in her mind,
And secret seeds of envy, lay behind;
Deep graven in her heart the doom remain'd
Of partial Paris, and her form disdain'd;
The grace bestow'd on ravish'd Ganymed,
Electra's glories, and her injur'd bed.
Each was a cause alone; and all combin'd
To kindle vengeance in her haughty mind.
For this, far distant from the Latian coast
She drove the remnants of the Trojan host;
And sev'n long years th' unhappy wand'ring train
Were toss'd by storms, and scatter'd thro' the main.
Such time, such toil, requir'd the Roman name,
Such length of labor for so vast a frame.
     Now scarce the Trojan fleet with sails and oars
Had left behind the fair Sicilian shores,
Entering with cheerful shouts the watery reign,
And plowing frothy furrows in the main,
When, laboring still, with endless discontent
The Queen of Heaven did thus her fury vent:—
     ""Then am I vanquished? must I yield?"" said she,
""And must the Trojans reign in Italy?""
So Fate will have it, and Jove adds his force;
Nor can my power divert their happy course.
Could angry Pallas, with revengeful spleen,
The Grecian navy burn and drown the men?
She, for the fault of one offending foe,
The bolts of Jove himself presumed to throw;
With whirlwinds from beneath she tossed the ship
And bare exposed the bosom of the deep:
Then, as an eagle gripes the trembling game,
The wretch , yet hissing with her father's flame,
She strongly seized, and with a burning wound,
Transfixed and naked, on a rock she bound.
But I, who walked in awful state above,
The majesty of heaven, the sister-wife of Jove,
For length of years my fruitless force employ
Against the thin remains of ruined Troy.
What nations now to Juno's power will pray,
Or offerings on  my slighted altars lay?""","The Queen of Heaven did thus her fury vent:  ""Then am I vanquished? must I yield?"" said she, ""And must the Trojans reign in Italy?"" ""For what offense the Queen of Heav'n began,"" she said."
Blues,"I am lazy, the laziest
girl in the world. I sleep during
the day when I want to, 'til
my face is creased and swollen,
'til my lips are dry and hot. I 
eat as I please: cookies and milk
after lunch, butter and sour cream
on my baked potato, foods that
slothful people eat, that turn
yellow and opaque beneath the skin.
Sometimes come dinnertime Sunday
I am still in my nightgown, the one
with the lace trim listing because
I have not mended it. Many days
I do not exercise, only
consider it, then rub my curdy
belly and lie down. Even
my poems are lazy. I use
syllabics instead of iambs,
prefer slant to the gong of full rhyme,
write briefly while others go
for pages. And yesterday,
for example, I did not work at all!
I got in my car and I drove 
to factory outlet stores, purchased
stockings and panties and socks
with my father's money.

To think, in childhood I missed only
one day of school per year. I went
to ballet class four days a week
at four-forty-five and on
Saturdays, beginning always
with plie, ending with curtsy.
To think, I knew only industry,
the industry of my race
and of immigrants, the radio
tuned always to the station
that said, Line up your summer
job months in advance. Work hard
and do not shame your family,
who worked hard to give you what you have.
There is no sin but sloth. Burn
to a wick and keep moving.

I avoided sleep for years,
up at night replaying 
evening news stories about
nearby jailbreaks, fat people
who ate fried chicken and woke up
dead. In sleep I am looking
for poems in the shape of open
V's of birds flying in formation,
or open arms saying, I forgive you, all.","I am lazy, the laziest girl in the world. I sleep during the day when I want to, 'til my face is creased and swollen.

The Naming of Cats,"The Naming of Cats is a difficult matter,
     It isn’t just one of your holiday games;
You may think at first I’m as mad as a hatter
When I tell you, a cat must have THREE DIFFERENT NAMES.
First of all, there’s the name that the family use daily,
     Such as Peter, Augustus, Alonzo, or James,
Such as Victor or Jonathan, George or Bill Bailey—
     All of them sensible everyday names.
There are fancier names if you think they sound sweeter,
     Some for the gentlemen, some for the dames:
Such as Plato, Admetus, Electra, Demeter—
     But all of them sensible everyday names,
But I tell you, a cat needs a name that’s particular,
     A name that’s peculiar, and more dignified,
Else how can he keep up his tail perpendicular,
     Or spread out his whiskers, or cherish his pride?
Of names of this kind, I can give you a quorum,
     Such as Munkustrap, Quaxo, or Coricopat,
Such as Bombalurina, or else Jellylorum—
     Names that never belong to more than one cat.
But above and beyond there’s still one name left over,
     And that is the name that you never will guess;
The name that no human research can discover—
     But THE CAT HIMSELF KNOWS, and will never confess.
When you notice a cat in profound meditation,
     The reason, I tell you, is always the same:
His mind is engaged in a rapt contemplation
     Of the thought, of the thought, of the thought of his name:
          His ineffable effable
          Effanineffable
Deep and inscrutable singular name.","The Naming of Cats is a difficult matter. A cat needs a name that’s particular, peculiar, and more dignified. The name that you never will guess is the name that no human research can discover."
Dreams,"Hold fast to dreams 
For if dreams die
Life is a broken-winged bird
That cannot fly.
Hold fast to dreams
For when dreams go
Life is a barren field
Frozen with snow.","Life is a broken-winged bird that cannot fly. Hold fast to dreams. For when dreams go, life is a barren field with snow."
Dead Stars,"Out here, there’s a bowing even the trees are doing.
                 Winter’s icy hand at the back of all of us.
Black bark, slick yellow leaves, a kind of stillness that feels
so mute it’s almost in another year.
I am a hearth of spiders these days: a nest of trying.
We point out the stars that make Orion as we take out
       the trash, the rolling containers a song of suburban thunder.
It’s almost romantic as we adjust the waxy blue
       recycling bin until you say, Man, we should really learn
some new constellations.
And it’s true. We keep forgetting about Antlia, Centaurus,
       Draco, Lacerta, Hydra, Lyra, Lynx.
But mostly we’re forgetting we’re dead stars too, my mouth is full
       of dust and I wish to reclaim the rising—
to lean in the spotlight of streetlight with you, toward
       what’s larger within us, toward how we were born.
Look, we are not unspectacular things.
       We’ve come this far, survived this much. What
would happen if we decided to survive more? To love harder?
What if we stood up with our synapses and flesh and said, No.
     No, to the rising tides.
Stood for the many mute mouths of the sea, of the land?
What would happen if we used our bodies to bargain
for the safety of others, for earth,
                 if we declared a clean night, if we stopped being terrified,
if we launched our demands into the sky, made ourselves so big
people could point to us with the arrows they make in their minds,
rolling their trash bins out, after all of this is over?",The author has been writing about his life in New York City. He says he is a hearth of spiders these days and wants to reclaim the rising. He asks: What would happen if we decided to survive more?
The City in the Sea,"Lo! Death has reared himself a throne
In a strange city lying alone
Far down within the dim West,
Where the good and the bad and the worst and the best
Have gone to their eternal rest.
There shrines and palaces and towers
(Time-eaten towers and tremble not!)
Resemble nothing that is ours.
Around, by lifting winds forgot,
Resignedly beneath the sky
The melancholy waters lie.
No rays from the holy Heaven come down
On the long night-time of that town;
But light from out the lurid sea
Streams up the turrets silently—
Gleams up the pinnacles far and free—
Up domes—up spires—up kingly halls—
Up fanes—up Babylon-like walls—
Up shadowy long-forgotten bowers
Of sculptured ivy and stone flowers—
Up many and many a marvellous shrine
Whose wreathed friezes intertwine
The viol, the violet, and the vine.
Resignedly beneath the sky
The melancholy waters lie.
So blend the turrets and shadows there
That all seem pendulous in air,
While from a proud tower in the town
Death looks gigantically down.
There open fanes and gaping graves
Yawn level with the luminous waves;
But not the riches there that lie
In each idol’s diamond eye—
Not the gaily-jewelled dead
Tempt the waters from their bed;
For no ripples curl, alas!
Along that wilderness of glass—
No swellings tell that winds may be
Upon some far-off happier sea—
No heavings hint that winds have been
On seas less hideously serene.
But lo, a stir is in the air!
The wave—there is a movement there!
As if the towers had thrust aside,
In slightly sinking, the dull tide—
As if their tops had feebly given
A void within the filmy Heaven.
The waves have now a redder glow—
The hours are breathing faint and low—
And when, amid no earthly moans,
Down, down that town shall settle hence,
Hell, rising from a thousand thrones,
Shall do it reverence.","In a strange city lying alone, Death has reared himself a throne. The good and the bad and the worst and the best have gone to their eternal rest. The melancholy waters lie beneath the sky."
Eldorado,"         Gaily bedight,
         A gallant knight,
     In sunshine and in shadow,
         Had journeyed long,
         Singing a song,
     In search of Eldorado.

         But he grew old—
         This knight so bold—
     And o’er his heart a shadow
         Fell, as he found
         No spot of ground
     That looked like Eldorado.

         And, as his strength
         Failed him at length,
     He met a pilgrim shadow—

Scaffolding,"Masons, when they start upon a building,
Are careful to test out the scaffolding;
Make sure that planks won’t slip at busy points,
Secure all ladders, tighten bolted joints.
And yet all this comes down when the job’s done
Showing off walls of sure and solid stone.
So if, my dear, there sometimes seem to be
Old bridges breaking between you and me
Never fear. We may let the scaffolds fall
Confident that we have built our wall.","Masons, when they start upon a building, are careful to test out the scaffolding.Secure all ladders, tighten bolted joints. And yet all this comes down when the job’s done."
"Song of Myself, V","I believe in you my soul, the other I am must not abase itself to you,
And you must not be abased to the other.
Loafe with me on the grass,  loose the stop from your throat,
Not words, not music or rhyme I want, not custom or lecture, not even the best,
Only the lull I like, the hum of your valvèd voice.
I mind how once we lay such a transparent summer morning, 
How you settled your head athwart my hips and gently turn'd over upon me,
And parted the shirt from my bosom-bone, and plunged your tongue to my bare-stript heart,
And reach'd till you felt my beard, and reach'd till you held my feet.
Swiftly arose and spread around me the peace and knowledge that pass all the argument of the earth,
And I know that the hand of God is the promise of my own,
And I know that the spirit of God is the brother of my own,
And that all the men ever born are also my brothers,  and the women my sisters and lovers,

A Poison Tree,"I was angry with my friend:
I told my wrath, my wrath did end.
I was angry with my foe:
I told it not, my wrath did grow.
And I watered it in fears
Night and morning with my tears,
And I sunned it with smiles
And with soft deceitful wiles.
And it grew both day and night,
Till it bore an apple bright,
And my foe beheld it shine,
And he knew that it was mine,--
And into my garden stole
When the night had veiled the pole;
In the morning, glad, I see
My foe outstretched beneath the tree.","""I told my wrath, my wrath did end. I was angry with my friend"" ""I watered it in fears,"" he says. ""I sunned it with smiles and with soft deceitful wiles"""
In Memory of W. B. Yeats,"I
He disappeared in the dead of winter:
The brooks were frozen, the airports almost deserted,
And snow disfigured the public statues;
The mercury sank in the mouth of the dying day.
What instruments we have agree
The day of his death was a dark cold day.
Far from his illness
The wolves ran on through the evergreen forests,
The peasant river was untempted by the fashionable quays;
By mourning tongues
The death of the poet was kept from his poems.
But for him it was his last afternoon as himself,
An afternoon of nurses and rumours;
The provinces of his body revolted,
The squares of his mind were empty,
Silence invaded the suburbs,
The current of his feeling failed; he became his admirers.
Now he is scattered among a hundred cities
And wholly given over to unfamiliar affections,
To find his happiness in another kind of wood
And be punished under a foreign code of conscience.
The words of a dead man
Are modified in the guts of the living.
But in the importance and noise of to-morrow
When the brokers are roaring like beasts on the floor of the bourse,
And the poor have the sufferings to which they are fairly accustomed
And each in the cell of himself is almost convinced of his freedom
A few thousand will think of this day
As one thinks of a day when one did something slightly unusual.
What instruments we have agree
The day of his death was a dark cold day.

You were silly like us; your gift survived it all:
The parish of rich women, physical decay,
Yourself. Mad Ireland hurt you into poetry.
Now Ireland has her madness and her weather still,
For poetry makes nothing happen: it survives
In the valley of its making where executives
Would never want to tamper, flows on south
From ranches of isolation and the busy griefs,
Raw towns that we believe and die in; it survives,
A way of happening, a mouth.
  III
Earth, receive an honoured guest:
William Yeats is laid to rest.
Let the Irish vessel lie
Emptied of its poetry.
In the nightmare of the dark
All the dogs of Europe bark,
And the living nations wait,
Each sequestered in its hate;
Intellectual disgrace
Stares from every human face,
And the seas of pity lie
Locked and frozen in each eye.
Follow, poet, follow right
To the bottom of the night,
With your unconstraining voice
Still persuade us to rejoice;
With the farming of a verse
Make a vineyard of the curse,
Sing of human unsuccess
In a rapture of distress;
In the deserts of the heart
Let the healing fountain start,
In the prison of his days
Teach the free man how to praise.",The poet died in the dead of winter. His death was kept from his poems. The words of a dead man are modified in the guts of the living. A few thousand will think of this day when one did something unusual.
And death shall have no dominion,"And death shall have no dominion.
Dead men naked they shall be one
With the man in the wind and the west moon;
When their bones are picked clean and the clean bones gone,
They shall have stars at elbow and foot;
Though they go mad they shall be sane,
Though they sink through the sea they shall rise again;
Though lovers be lost love shall not;
And death shall have no dominion.
And death shall have no dominion.
Under the windings of the sea
They lying long shall not die windily;
Twisting on racks when sinews give way,
Strapped to a wheel, yet they shall not break;
Faith in their hands shall snap in two,
And the unicorn evils run them through;
Split all ends up they shan't crack;
And death shall have no dominion.
And death shall have no dominion.
No more may gulls cry at their ears
Or waves break loud on the seashores;
Where blew a flower may a flower no more
Lift its head to the blows of the rain;
Though they be mad and dead as nails,
Heads of the characters hammer through daisies;
Break in the sun till the sun breaks down,
And death shall have no dominion.","""Though they go mad they shall be sane,Though they sink through the sea they shall rise again. And death shall have no dominion"""
When We Two Parted,"When we two parted
   In silence and tears,
Half broken-hearted
   To sever for years,
Pale grew thy cheek and cold,
   Colder thy kiss;
Truly that hour foretold
   Sorrow to this.
The dew of the morning
   Sunk chill on my brow— 
It felt like the warning
   Of what I feel now.
Thy vows are all broken,
   And light is thy fame;
I hear thy name spoken,
   And share in its shame.
They name thee before me,
   A knell to mine ear;
A shudder comes o'er me—
   Why wert thou so dear?
They know not I knew thee,
   Who knew thee too well—
Long, long shall I rue thee,
   Too deeply to tell.
In secret we met—
   In silence I grieve,
That thy heart could forget,
   Thy spirit deceive.

   After long years,
How should I greet thee?—

The Myth of Innocence,"One summer she goes into the field as usual
stopping for a bit at the pool where she often
looks at herself, to see
if she detects any changes. She sees
the same person, the horrible mantle
of daughterliness still clinging to her.

The sun seems, in the water, very close.
That's my uncle spying again, she thinks—
everything in nature is in some way her relative.
I am never alone, she thinks,
turning the thought into a prayer.
Then death appears, like the answer to a prayer.

No one understands anymore
how beautiful he was. But Persephone remembers.
Also that he embraced her, right there,
with her uncle watching. She remembers
sunlight flashing on his bare arms.

This is the last moment she remembers clearly.
Then the dark god bore her away.

She also remembers, less clearly,
the chilling insight that from this moment
she couldn't live without him again.

The girl who disappears from the pool
will never return. A woman will return,
looking for the girl she was.

She stands by the pool saying, from time to time,
I was abducted, but it sounds
wrong to her, nothing like what she felt.
Then she says, I was not abducted.
Then she says, I offered myself, I wanted
to escape my body. Even, sometimes,
I willed this. But ignorance

cannot will knowledge. Ignorance
wills something imagined, which it believes exists.

All the different nouns—
she says them in rotation.
Death, husband, god, stranger.
Everything sounds so simple, so conventional.
I must have been, she thinks, a simple girl.

She can't remember herself as that person
but she keeps thinking the pool will remember
and explain to her the meaning of her prayer
so she can understand
whether it was answered or not.",Persephone was abducted from the pool by her uncle. She remembers the last moment she saw her husband before he died. She asks the pool to explain to her the meaning of her prayer.
The Angel,"I dreamt a dream!  What can it mean?
And that I was a maiden Queen
Guarded by an Angel mild:
Witless woe was ne’er beguiled!

And I wept both night and day,
And he wiped my tears away;
And I wept both day and night,
And hid from him my heart’s delight.

So he took his wings, and fled;
Then the morn blushed rosy red.
I dried my tears, and armed my fears
With ten thousand shields and spears.

Soon my Angel came again;
I was armed, he came in vain;
For the time of youth was fled,
And grey hairs were on my head.",I dreamt a dream!  What can it mean? I was a maiden Queen.Guarded by an Angel mild.Witless woe was ne’er beguiled!
Enigma,"It would be easy to forgive,
If I could but remember;
If I could hear, lost love of mine,
The music of your cruelties,
Shaking to sound the silent skies,
Could voice with them their song divine,
Red with pain’s leaping ember:
It would be easy to forgive,
If I could but remember.
It would be easy to forget,
If I could find lost Sorrow;
If I could kiss her plaintive face,
And break with her her bitter bread,
Could share again her woeful bed,
And know with tears her pale embrace.

The Watchers,"Beside a stricken field I stood;
On the torn turf, on grass and wood,
Hung heavily the dew of blood.
Still in their fresh mounds lay the slain,
But all the air was quick with pain
And gusty sighs and tearful rain.
Two angels, each with drooping head
And folded wings and noiseless treads,
Watched by that valley of the dead.
The one, with forehead saintly bland
And lips of blessing, not command,
Leaned, weeping, on her olive wand.
The other’s brows were scarred and knit,
His restless eyes were watch-fires lit,
His hands for battle-gauntlets fit.
“How long!”—I knew the voice of Peace,
“Is there no respite? no release?
When shall the hopeless quarrel cease?
“O Lord, how long! One human soul
Is more than any parchment scroll,
Or any flag thy winds unroll.
“What price was Ellsworth’s, young and brave?
How weigh the gift that Lyon gave,
Or count the cost of Winthrop’s grave?
“O brother! if thine eye can see,
Tell how and when the end shall be,
What hope remains for thee and me.”
Then Freedom sternly said: “I shun
No strife nor pang beneath the sun,
When human rights are staked and won.
“I knelt with Ziska’s hunted flock,
I watched in Toussaint’s cell of rock,
I walked with Sidney to the block.
“The moor of Marston felt my tread,
Through Jersey snows the march I led,
My voice Magenta’s charges sped.
“But now, through weary day and night,
I watch a vague and aimless fight
For leave to strike one blow aright.
“On either side my foe they own:
One guards through love his ghastly throne,
And one through fear to reverence grown.
“Why wait we longer, mocked, betrayed,
By open foes, or those afraid
To speed thy coming through my aid?
“Why watch to see who win or fall?
I shake the dust against them all,
I leave them to their senseless brawl.”
“Nay,” Peace implored: “yet longer wait;
The doom is near, the stake is great:
God knoweth if it be too late.
“Still wait and watch; the way prepare
Where I with folded wings of prayer
May follow, weaponless and bare.”
“Too late!” the stern, sad voice replied,
“Too late!” its mournful echo sighed,
In low lament the answer died.
A rustling as of wings in flight,
An upward gleam of lessening white,
So passed the vision, sound and sight.
But round me, like a silver bell
Rung down the listening sky to tell
Of holy help, a sweet voice fell.
“Still hope and trust,” it sang; “the rod
Must fall, the wine-press must be trod,
But all is possible with God!”","“I knelt with Ziska’s hunted flock,” he writes. “I watched in Toussaint’S cell of rock,’ he adds. ‘I walked with Sidney to the block.’ ‘The moor of Marston felt my tread,Through Jersey snows the march I led,‘ he says."
One Today,"A Poem for Barack Obama’s Presidential Inauguration
January 21, 2013
  One sun rose on us today, kindled over our shores,
peeking over the Smokies, greeting the faces
of the Great Lakes, spreading a simple truth
across the Great Plains, then charging across the Rockies.
One light, waking up rooftops, under each one, a story
told by our silent gestures moving behind windows.
My face, your face, millions of faces in morning’s mirrors,
each one yawning to life, crescendoing into our day:
pencil-yellow school buses, the rhythm of traffic lights,
fruit stands: apples, limes, and oranges arrayed like rainbows
begging our praise. Silver trucks heavy with oil or paper—
bricks or milk, teeming over highways alongside us,
on our way to clean tables, read ledgers, or save lives—
to teach geometry, or ring-up groceries as my mother did
for twenty years, so I could write this poem.
All of us as vital as the one light we move through,
the same light on blackboards with lessons for the day:
equations to solve, history to question, or atoms imagined,
the “I have a dream” we keep dreaming,
or the impossible vocabulary of sorrow that won’t explain
the empty desks of twenty children marked absent
today, and forever. Many prayers, but one light
breathing color into stained glass windows,
life into the faces of bronze statues, warmth
onto the steps of our museums and park benches
as mothers watch children slide into the day.
One ground. Our ground, rooting us to every stalk
of corn, every head of wheat sown by sweat
and hands, hands gleaning coal or planting windmills
in deserts and hilltops that keep us warm, hands
digging trenches, routing pipes and cables, hands
as worn as my father’s cutting sugarcane
so my brother and I could have books and shoes.
The dust of farms and deserts, cities and plains
mingled by one wind—our breath. Breathe. Hear it
through the day’s gorgeous din of honking cabs,
buses launching down avenues, the symphony
of footsteps, guitars, and screeching subways,
the unexpected song bird on your clothes line.
Hear: squeaky playground swings, trains whistling,
or whispers across café tables, Hear: the doors we open
for each other all day, saying: hello / shalom,
buon giorno / howdy / namaste / or buenos días
in the language my mother taught me—in every language
spoken into one wind carrying our lives
without prejudice, as these words break from my lips.
One sky: since the Appalachians and Sierras claimed
their majesty, and the Mississippi and Colorado worked
their way to the sea. Thank the work of our hands:
weaving steel into bridges, finishing one more report
for the boss on time, stitching another wound
or uniform, the first brush stroke on a portrait,
or the last floor on the Freedom Tower
jutting into a sky that yields to our resilience.
One sky, toward which we sometimes lift our eyes
tired from work: some days guessing at the weather
of our lives, some days giving thanks for a love
that loves you back, sometimes praising a mother
who knew how to give, or forgiving a father
who couldn’t give what you wanted.
We head home: through the gloss of rain or weight
of snow, or the plum blush of dusk, but always—home,
always under one sky, our sky. And always one moon
like a silent drum tapping on every rooftop
and every window, of one country—all of us—
facing the stars
hope—a new constellation
waiting for us to map it,
waiting for us to name it—together

Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening,"Whose woods these are I think I know.
His house is in the village though;
He will not see me stopping here
To watch his woods fill up with snow.
My little horse must think it queer
To stop without a farmhouse near
Between the woods and frozen lake
The darkest evening of the year.
He gives his harness bells a shake
To ask if there is some mistake.
The only other sound's the sweep
Of easy wind and downy flake.
The woods are lovely, dark and deep.
But I have promises to keep,
And miles to go before I sleep,
And miles to go before I sleep.","The woods are lovely, dark and deep. But I have promises to keep,                And miles to go before I sleep,                . The only other sound's the sweep of easy wind and downy flake."

I measure every Grief I meet (561),"I measure every Grief I meet

Song of Nature,"Mine are the night and morning,
The pits of air, the gulf of space,
The sportive sun, the gibbous moon,
The innumerable days.
I hid in the solar glory,
I am dumb in the pealing song,
I rest on the pitch of the torrent,
In slumber I am strong.
No numbers have counted my tallies,
No tribes my house can fill,
I sit by the shining Fount of Life,
And pour the deluge still;
And ever by delicate powers
Gathering along the centuries
From race on race the rarest flowers,
My wreath shall nothing miss.
And many a thousand summers
My apples ripened well,
And light from meliorating stars
With firmer glory fell.
I wrote the past in characters
Of rock and fire the scroll,
The building in the coral sea,
The planting of the coal.
And thefts from satellites and rings
And broken stars I drew,
And out of spent and aged things
I formed the world anew;
What time the gods kept carnival,
Tricked out in star and flower,
And in cramp elf and saurian forms
They swathed their too much power.
Time and Thought were my surveyors,
They laid their courses well,
They boiled the sea, and baked the layers
Or granite, marl, and shell.
But he, the man-child glorious,—
Where tarries he the while?
The rainbow shines his harbinger,
The sunset gleams his smile.
My boreal lights leap upward,
Forthright my planets roll,
And still the man-child is not born,
The summit of the whole.
Must time and tide forever run?
Will never my winds go sleep in the west?
Will never my wheels which whirl the sun
And satellites have rest?
Too much of donning and doffing,
Too slow the rainbow fades,
I weary of my robe of snow,
My leaves and my cascades;
I tire of globes and races,
Too long the game is played;
What without him is summer's pomp,
Or winter’s frozen shade?
I travail in pain for him,
My creatures travail and wait;
His couriers come by squadrons,
He comes not to the gate.
Twice I have moulded an image,
And thrice outstretched my hand,
Made one of day, and one of night,
And one of the salt sea-sand.
One in a Judaean manger,
And one by Avon stream,
One over against the mouths of Nile,
And one in the Academe.
I moulded kings and saviours,
And bards o’er kings to rule;—
But fell the starry influence short,
The cup was never full.
Yet whirl the glowing wheels once more,
And mix the bowl again;
Seethe, fate! the ancient elements,
Heat, cold, wet, dry, and peace, and pain.
Let war and trade and creeds and song
Blend, ripen race on race,
The sunburnt world a man shall breed
Of all the zones, and countless days.
No ray is dimmed, no atom worn,
My oldest force is good as new,
And the fresh rose on yonder thorn
Gives back the bending heavens in dew.","""I sit by the shining Fount of Life, the sportive sun, the gibbous moon, and the innumerable days. I hid in the solar glory, I am dumb in the pealing song, I rest on the pitch of the torrent, in slumber I am strong,"" he writes."
The Road Not Taken,"Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,
And sorry I could not travel both
And be one traveler, long I stood
And looked down one as far as I could
To where it bent in the undergrowth;
Then took the other, as just as fair,
And having perhaps the better claim,
Because it was grassy and wanted wear;
Though as for that the passing there
Had worn them really about the same,
And both that morning equally lay
In leaves no step had trodden black.
Oh, I kept the first for another day!
Yet knowing how way leads on to way,
I doubted if I should ever come back.
I shall be telling this with a sigh
Somewhere ages and ages hence:
Two roads diverged in a wood, and I—
I took the one less traveled by,
And that has made all the difference.","Two roads diverged in a yellow wood, and sorry I could not travel both, long I stood. I took the one less traveled by, and that has made all the difference."
Kubla Khan,"Or a Vision in a Dream. A Fragment
In Xanadu did Kubla Khan
A stately pleasure dome decree:
Where Alph, the sacred river, ran
Through caverns measureless to man
    Down to a sunless sea.
So twice five miles of fertile ground
With walls and towers were girdled round:
And there were gardens bright with sinuous rills,
Where blossomed many an incense-bearing tree;
And here were forests ancient as the hills,
Enfolding sunny spots of greenery.
But oh! that deep romantic chasm which slanted
Down the green hill athwart a cedarn cover!
A savage place! as holy and enchanted
As e'er beneath a waning moon was haunted
By woman wailing for her demon lover!
And from this chasm, with ceaseless turmoil seething,
As if this earth in fast thick pants were breathing,
A mighty fountain momently was forced:
Amid whose swift half-intermitted burst
Huge fragments vaulted like rebounding hail,
Or chaffy grain beneath the thresher's flail:
And ’mid these dancing rocks at once and ever
It flung up momently the sacred river.
Five miles meandering with a mazy motion
Through wood and dale the sacred river ran,
Then reached the caverns measureless to man,
And sank in tumult to a lifeless ocean:
And ’mid this tumult Kubla heard from far
Ancestral voices prophesying war!
    The shadow of the dome of pleasure
    Floated midway on the waves;
    Where was heard the mingled measure
    From the fountain and the caves.
It was a miracle of rare device,
A sunny pleasure-dome with caves of ice!
    A damsel with a dulcimer
    In a vision once I saw;
    It was an Abyssinian maid,
    And on her dulcimer she played,
    Singing of Mount Abora.
    Could I revive within me
    Her symphony and song,
    To such a deep delight ’twould win me,
That with music loud and long,
I would build that dome in air,
That sunny dome! those caves of ice!
And all who heard should see them there,
And all should cry, Beware! Beware!
His flashing eyes, his floating hair!
Weave a circle round him thrice,
And close your eyes with holy dread,
For he on honey-dew hath fed,
And drunk the milk of Paradise.","In Xanadu did Kubla Khan decree:Where Alph, the sacred river, ran through caverns measureless to man, down to a sunless sea. The shadow of the dome of pleasureFloated midway on the waves; where was heard the mingled measure and song of Mount Abora."
On Love,"Then said Almitra, Speak to us of Love.
     And he raised his head and looked upon the people, and there fell a stillness upon them. And with a great voice he said:
     When love beckons to you, follow him,
     Though his ways are hard and steep.
     And when his wings enfold you yield to him,
     Though the sword hidden among his pinions may wound you.
     And when he speaks to you believe in him,
     Though his voice may shatter your dreams as the north wind lays waste the garden.
     For even as love crowns you so shall he crucify you. Even as he is for your growth so is he for your pruning.
     Even as he ascends to your height and caresses your tenderest branches that quiver in the sun,
     So shall he descend to your roots and shake them in their clinging to the earth.
     Like sheaves of corn he gathers you unto himself
     He threshes you to make your naked.
     He sifts you to free you from your husks.
     He grinds you to whiteness.
     He kneads you until you are pliant;
     And then he assigns you to his sacred fire, that you may become sacred bread for God’s sacred feast.
     All these things shall love do unto you that you may know the secrets of your heart, and in that knowledge become a fragment of Life’s heart.
     But if in your heart you would seek only love’s peace and love’s pleasure,
     Then it is better for you that you cover your nakedness and pass out of love’s threshing-floor,
     Into the seasonless world where you shall laugh, but not all of your laughter, and weep, but not all of your tears.
     Love gives naught but itself and takes naught but from itself.
     Love possesses not nor would it be possessed;
     For love is sufficient unto love.
     When you love you should not say, “God is in my heart,” but rather, “I am in the heart of God.”
     And think not you can direct the course of love, for love, if it finds you worthy, directs your course.
     Love has no other desire but to fulfil itself.
     But if you love and must needs have desires, let these be your desires:
     To melt and be like a running brook that sings its melody to the night.
     To know the pain of too much tenderness.
     To be wounded by your own understanding of love;
     And to bleed willingly and joyfully.
     To wake at dawn with a winged heart and give thanks for another day of loving;
     To rest at the noon hour and meditate love’s ecstasy;
     To return home at eventide with gratitude;
     And then to sleep with a prayer for the beloved in your heart and a song of praise upon your lips.","Almitra spoke of the power of love and how it can change our lives. He said that love can make us laugh and weep, but not all of our tears."
I Have a Rendezvous with Death,"I have a rendezvous with Death
At some disputed barricade,
When Spring comes back with rustling shade
And apple-blossoms fill the air—
I have a rendezvous with Death
When Spring brings back blue days and fair.
It may be he shall take my hand
And lead me into his dark land
And close my eyes and quench my breath—
It may be I shall pass him still.
I have a rendezvous with Death
On some scarred slope of battered hill,
When Spring comes round again this year
And the first meadow-flowers appear.
God knows ’twere better to be deep
Pillowed in silk and scented down,
Where love throbs out in blissful sleep,
Pulse nigh to pulse, and breath to breath,
Where hushed awakenings are dear...
But I’ve a rendezvous with Death
At midnight in some flaming town,
When Spring trips north again this year,
And I to my pledged word am true,
I shall not fail that rendezvous.","I have a rendezvous with Death at some disputed barricade, when Spring comes back with rustling shade and apple-blossoms fill the air. I to my pledged word am true, I shall not fail that rendezvous."
On Joy and Sorrow,"Then a woman said, Speak to us of Joy and Sorrow.
And he answered:
Your joy is your sorrow unmasked.
And the selfsame well from which your laughter rises was oftentimes filled with your tears.
And how else can it be?
The deeper that sorrow carves into your being, the more joy you can contain.
Is not the cup that holds your wine the very cup that was burned in the potter’s oven?
And is not the lute that soothes your spirit, the very wood that was hollowed with knives?
When you are joyous, look deep into your heart and you shall find it is only that which has given you sorrow that is giving you joy.
When you are sorrowful look again in your heart, and you shall see that in truth you are weeping for that which has been your delight.
Some of you say, “Joy is greater than sorrow,” and others say, “Nay, sorrow is the greater.”
But I say unto you, they are inseparable.
Together they come, and when one sits alone with you at your board, remember that the other is asleep upon your bed.
Verily you are suspended like scales between your sorrow and your joy.
Only when you are empty are you at standstill and balanced.
When the treasure-keeper lifts you to weigh his gold and his silver, needs must your joy or your sorrow rise or fall.","The deeper that sorrow carves into your being, the more joy you can contain. When you are empty are you at standstill and balanced. When the treasure-keeper lifts you to weigh his gold and his silver, needs must your joy or your sorrow rise or fall."
Instructions on Not Giving Up,"More than the fuchsia funnels breaking out
of the crabapple tree, more than the neighbor’s
almost obscene display of cherry limbs shoving
their cotton candy-colored blossoms to the slate
sky of Spring rains, it’s the greening of the trees
that really gets to me. When all the shock of white
and taffy, the world’s baubles and trinkets, leave
the pavement strewn with the confetti of aftermath,
the leaves come. Patient, plodding, a green skin
growing over whatever winter did to us, a return
to the strange idea of continuous living despite
the mess of us, the hurt, the empty. Fine then,
I’ll take it, the tree seems to say, a new slick leaf
unfurling like a fist to an open palm, I’ll take it all.","More than the fuchsia funnels breaking out of the crabapple tree, it’s the greening of the trees that really gets to me. Patient, plodding, a green skin growing over whatever winter did to us, a return to the strange idea of continuous living despite the mess of us."
Yours,"I am yours as the summer air at evening is
Possessed by the scent of linden blossoms,

As the snowcap gleams with light
Lent it by the brimming moon.

Without you I'd be an unleafed tree
Blasted in a bleakness with no Spring.

Your love is the weather of my being.
What is an island without the sea?",I am yours as the summer air at evening is is yours. I am possessed by the scent of linden blossoms. Without you I'd be an unleafed tree.
Under the Harvest Moon,"   Under the harvest moon, 
When the soft silver
Drips shimmering
Over the garden nights,
Death, the gray mocker, 
Comes and whispers to you
As a beautiful friend
Who remembers.

   Under the summer roses 
When the flagrant crimson
Lurks in the dusk
Of the wild red leaves,
Love, with little hands,
Comes and touches you
With a thousand memories, 
And asks you
Beautiful, unanswerable questions.","The book is about a young man's love for his mother, his father, his brother and his grandmother. The book is called ""The Story of My Mother"" and is published by Penguin Books."
The Stolen Child,"Where dips the rocky highland
Of Sleuth Wood in the lake,
There lies a leafy island
Where flapping herons wake
The drowsy water rats;
There we've hid our faery vats,
Full of berrys
And of reddest stolen cherries.
Come away, O human child!
To the waters and the wild
With a faery, hand in hand,
For the world's more full of weeping than you can understand.
Where the wave of moonlight glosses
The dim gray sands with light,
Far off by furthest Rosses
We foot it all the night,
Weaving olden dances
Mingling hands and mingling glances
Till the moon has taken flight;
To and fro we leap
And chase the frothy bubbles,
While the world is full of troubles
And anxious in its sleep.
Come away, O human child!
To the waters and the wild
With a faery, hand in hand,
For the world's more full of weeping than you can understand.
Where the wandering water gushes
From the hills above Glen-Car,
In pools among the rushes
That scarce could bathe a star,
We seek for slumbering trout
And whispering in their ears
Give them unquiet dreams;
Leaning softly out
From ferns that drop their tears
Over the young streams.
Come away, O human child!
To the waters and the wild
With a faery, hand in hand,
For the world's more full of weeping than you can understand.
Away with us he's going,
The solemn-eyed:
He'll hear no more the lowing
Of the calves on the warm hillside
Or the kettle on the hob
Sing peace into his breast,
Or see the brown mice bob
Round and round the oatmeal chest.
For he comes, the human child,
To the waters and the wild
With a faery, hand in hand,
For the world's more full of weeping than he can understand.","We foot it all the night, weaving olden dances, weeding olden berry vats. We seek for slumbering trout, whispering in their ears. We chase the frothy bubbles, chasing the bubbles, while the world is full of troubles. The world's more full of weeping than you can understand."
Ars Poetica,"A poem should be palpable and mute
As a globed fruit,
Dumb
As old medallions to the thumb,
Silent as the sleeve-worn stone
Of casement ledges where the moss has grown—
A poem should be wordless
As the flight of birds.
                 *
A poem should be motionless in time
As the moon climbs,
Leaving, as the moon releases
Twig by twig the night-entangled trees,
Leaving, as the moon behind the winter leaves,
Memory by memory the mind—
A poem should be motionless in time
As the moon climbs.
                  *
A poem should be equal to:
Not true.
For all the history of grief
An empty doorway and a maple leaf.
For love
The leaning grasses and two lights above the sea—
A poem should not mean
But be.","A poem should be motionless in time as the moon climbs. A poem should not mean to be true, but to be palpable and mute. An empty doorway and a maple leaf should be equal to love."
Novel,"I.

No one's serious at seventeen.
—On beautiful nights when beer and lemonade
And loud, blinding cafés are the last thing you need
—You stroll beneath green lindens on the promenade.

Lindens smell fine on fine June nights!
Sometimes the air is so sweet that you close your eyes;
The wind brings sounds—the town is near—
And carries scents of vineyards and beer. . .

II.

—Over there, framed by a branch
You can see a little patch of dark blue
Stung by a sinister star that fades
With faint quiverings, so small and white. . .

June nights! Seventeen!—Drink it in.
Sap is champagne, it goes to your head. . .
The mind wanders, you feel a kiss
On your lips, quivering like a living thing. . .

III.

The wild heart Crusoes through a thousand novels
—And when a young girl walks alluringly
Through a streetlamp's pale light, beneath the ominous shadow
Of her father's starched collar. . .

Because as she passes by, boot heels tapping,
She turns on a dime, eyes wide, 
Finding you too sweet to resist. . .
—And cavatinas die on your lips.

You're in love. Off the market till August.
You're in love.—Your sonnets make Her laugh.
Your friends are gone, you're bad news.

You order beer or lemonade. . .

Not Waving but Drowning,"Nobody heard him, the dead man,
But still he lay moaning:
I was much further out than you thought
And not waving but drowning.
Poor chap, he always loved larking
And now he’s dead
It must have been too cold for him his heart gave way,
They said.
Oh, no no no, it was too cold always
(Still the dead one lay moaning)
I was much too far out all my life
And not waving but drowning.","Nobody heard him, the dead man, but still he lay moaning. He said: ""I was much further out than you thought and not waving but drowning"""
"To John Keats, Poet. At Spring Time*","(For Carl Van Vechten)
I cannot hold my peace, John Keats;
There never was a spring like this;
It is an echo, that repeats
My last year's song and next year's bliss.
I know, in spite of all men say
Of Beauty, you have felt her most.
Yea, even in your grave her way
Is laid. Poor, troubled, lyric ghost,
Spring never was so fair and dear
As Beauty makes her seem this year.
I cannot hold my peace, John Keats,
I am as helpless in the toil
Of Spring as any lamb that bleats
To feel the solid earth recoil
Beneath his puny legs. Spring beats
Her tocsin call to those who love her,
And lo! the dogwood petals cover
Her breast with drifts of snow, and sleek
White gulls fly screaming to her, and hover
About her shoulders, and kiss her cheek,
While white and purple lilacs muster
A strength that bears them to a cluster
Of color and odor; for her sake
All things that slept are now awake.
And you and I, shall we lie still,
John Keats, while Beauty summons us?
Somehow I feel your sensitive will
Is pulsing up some tremulous
Sap road of a maple tree, whose leaves
Grow music as they grow, since your
Wild voice is in them, a harp that grieves
For life that opens death's dark door.
Though dust, your fingers still can push
The Vision Splendid to a birth,
Though now they work as grass in the hush
Of the night on the broad sweet page of the earth.
""John Keats is dead,"" they say, but I
Who hear your full insistent cry
In bud and blossom, leaf and tree,
Know John Keats still writes poetry.
And while my head is earthward bowed
To read new life sprung from your shroud,
Folks seeing me must think it strange
That merely spring should so derange
My mind. They do not know that you,
John Keats, keep revel with me, too.
  *Spring, 1924","John Keats' poem, ""Spring,"" was published in 1924. The poem was written in the style of Carl Van Vechten. ""Spring never was so fair and dear as Beauty makes her seem this year"""
Final Soliloquy of the Interior Paramour,"Light the first light of evening, as in a room
In which we rest and, for small reason, think
The world imagined is the ultimate good.

This is, therefore, the intensest rendezvous. 
It is in that thought that we collect ourselves,
Out of all the indifferences, into one thing:

Within a single thing, a single shawl
Wrapped tightly round us, since we are poor, a warmth, 
A light, a power, the miraculous influence.

Here, now, we forget each other and ourselves.
We feel the obscurity of an order, a whole, 
A knowledge, that which arranged the rendezvous.

Within its vital boundary, in the mind.
We say God and the imagination are one... 
How high that highest candle lights the dark.

Out of this same light, out of the central mind, 
We make a dwelling in the evening air, 
In which being there together is enough.","The world imagined is the ultimate good. Light the first light of evening, as in a room in which we rest and, for small reason, think. We feel the obscurity of an order, a whole, a knowledge."
"The Merchant of Venice, Act IV, Scene I [The quality of mercy is not strained]","The quality of mercy is not strained;
It droppeth as the gentle rain from heaven
Upon the place beneath. It is twice blest;
It blesseth him that gives and him that takes:
'T is mightiest in the mightiest; it becomes
The throned monarch better than his crown:
His sceptre shows the force of temporal power,
The attribute to awe and majesty,
Wherein doth sit the dread and fear of kings;
But mercy is above this sceptred sway;
It is enthronèd in the hearts of kings,
It is an attribute to God himself;
And earthly power doth then show likest God's
When mercy seasons justice. Therefore, Jew,
Though justice be thy plea, consider this,
That, in the course of justice, none of us
Should see salvation: we do pray for mercy;
And that same prayer doth teach us all to render
The deeds of mercy. I have spoke thus much
To mitigate the justice of thy plea;
Which if thou follow, this strict court of Venice
Must needs give sentence 'gainst the merchant there.",Mercy is not strained. It droppeth as the gentle rain from heaven. It is twice blest. It blesseth him that gives and him that takes. It becomes mightiest in the mightiest; it becomes better than his crown.
Loveliest of Trees,"Loveliest of trees, the cherry now
Is hung with bloom along the bough,
And stands about the woodland ride
Wearing white for Eastertide.
Now, of my threescore years and ten,
Twenty will not come again,
And take from seventy springs a score,
It only leaves me fifty more.
And since to look at things in bloom
Fifty springs are little room,
About the woodlands I will go
To see the cherry hung with snow.","The cherry is hung with bloom along the bough,                Wearing white for Eastertide. Of my threescore years and ten,                Twenty will not come again,                And take from seventy springs a score,                It only leaves me fifty more."
"Lay of the Last Minstrel, Canto VI, [My Native Land]","   Breathes there the man, with soul so dead,
Who never to himself hath said,
   This is my own, my native land!
Whose heart hath ne'er within him burn'd,
As home his footsteps he hath turn'd
   From wandering on a foreign strand!
If such there breathe, go, mark him well;
For him no Minstrel raptures swell;
High though his titles, proud his name,
Boundless his wealth as wish can claim;—
Despite those titles, power, and pelf,
The wretch, concentred all in self,
Living, shall forfeit fair renown,
And, doubly dying, shall go down
To the vile dust, from whence he sprung,
Unwept, unhonour'd, and unsung.","High though his titles, proud his name, boundless his wealth as wish can claim. Despite those titles, power, and pelf, the wretch, concentred all in self, shall forfeit fair renown, and go down to the vile dust."
The Land of Counterpane,"When I was sick and lay a-bed,
I had two pillows at my head,
And all my toys beside me lay
To keep me happy all the day.
And sometimes for an hour or so
I watched my leaden soldiers go,
With different uniforms and drills,
Among the bed-clothes, through the hills;
And sometimes sent my ships in fleets
All up and down among the sheets;
Or brought my trees and houses out,
And planted cities all about.
I was the giant great and still
That sits upon the pillow-hill,
And sees before him, dale and plain,
The pleasant land of counterpane.","When I was sick and lay a-bed, I had two pillows at my head,                And all my toys beside me lay.                I watched my leaden soldiers go,                With different uniforms and drills,                Among the bed-clothes, through the hills."
Aedh Wishes for the Cloths of Heaven,"Had I the heavens' embroidered cloths,
Enwrought with golden and silver light,
The blue and the dim and the dark cloths
Of night and light and the half light,
I would spread the cloths under your feet:
But I, being poor, have only my dreams;
I have spread my dreams under your feet;
Tread softly because you tread on my dreams.","""I, being poor, have only my dreams,"" he writes. ""Tread softly because you tread on my dreams"" ""I would spread the cloths under your feet,"" he adds."
Love's Philosophy,"The fountains mingle with the river
And the rivers with the ocean,
The winds of heaven mix for ever
With a sweet emotion;
Nothing in the world is single,
All things by a law divine
In one another's being mingle—
Why not I with thine?
See the mountains kiss high heaven,
And the waves clasp one another;
No sister-flower would be forgiven
If it disdain'd its brother;
And the sunlight clasps the earth,
And the moonbeams kiss the sea—
What is all this sweet work worth
If thou kiss not me?",The fountains mingle with the river and the rivers with the ocean. The winds of heaven mix for ever with a sweet emotion. Nothing in the world is single.
Before You Came,"Before you came,
things were as they should be:
the sky was the dead-end of sight,
the road was just a road, wine merely wine.

Now everything is like my heart,
a color at the edge of blood:
the grey of your absence, the color of poison, of thorns,
the gold when we meet, the season ablaze,
the yellow of autumn, the red of flowers, of flames,
and the black when you cover the earth
with the coal of dead fires.

And the sky, the road, the glass of wine?
The sky is a shirt wet with tears,
the road a vein about to break,
and the glass of wine a mirror in which
the sky, the road, the world keep changing.

Don't leave now that you're here—
Stay. So the world may become like itself again:
so the sky may be the sky,
the road a road,
and the glass of wine not a mirror, just a glass of wine.","Before you came, the sky was the dead-end of sight, the road was just a road, wine merely wine. Now everything is like my heart, a color at the edge of blood: grey of your absence, the color of poison, of thorns, gold when we meet."

Ozymandias,"I met a traveller from an antique land
Who said: “Two vast and trunkless legs of stone
Stand in the desert . . . Near them, on the sand,
Half sunk, a shattered visage lies, whose frown,
And wrinkled lip, and sneer of cold command,
Tell that its sculptor well those passions read
Which yet survive, stamped on these lifeless things,
The hand that mocked them, and the heart that fed:
And on the pedestal these words appear:
‘My name is Ozymandias, king of kings:
Look on my works, ye Mighty, and despair!’
Nothing beside remains. Round the decay
Of that colossal wreck, boundless and bare
The lone and level sands stretch far away.”",The work was created by the sculptor Ozymandias. The work was inspired by a traveller from an antique land. It is on display at the Museum of Modern Art in New York.

A Blessing,"Just off the highway to Rochester, Minnesota,
Twilight bounds softly forth on the grass.
And the eyes of those two Indian ponies
Darken with kindness.
They have come gladly out of the willows
To welcome my friend and me.
We step over the barbed wire into the pasture
Where they have been grazing all day, alone.
They ripple tensely, they can hardly contain their happiness
That we have come.
They bow shyly as wet swans. They love each other.
There is no loneliness like theirs.
At home once more,
They begin munching the young tufts of spring in the darkness.
I would like to hold the slenderer one in my arms,
For she has walked over to me
And nuzzled my left hand.
She is black and white,
Her mane falls wild on her forehead,
And the light breeze moves me to caress her long ear
That is delicate as the skin over a girl’s wrist.
Suddenly I realize
That if I stepped out of my body I would break
Into blossom.","The author met two Indian ponies in Rochester, Minnesota. The pair have been friends since childhood. The author describes the moment he first met the ponies."
Life is Fine,"I went down to the river,
I set down on the bank.
I tried to think but couldn't,
So I jumped in and sank.
I came up once and hollered!
I came up twice and cried!
If that water hadn't a-been so cold
I might've sunk and died.
     But it was      Cold in that water!      It was cold!
I took the elevator
Sixteen floors above the ground.
I thought about my baby
And thought I would jump down.
I stood there and I hollered!
I stood there and I cried!
If it hadn't a-been so high
I might've jumped and died.
     But it was      High up there!      It was high!
So since I'm still here livin',
I guess I will live on.
I could've died for love—
But for livin' I was born
Though you may hear me holler,
And you may see me cry—
I'll be dogged, sweet baby,
If you gonna see me die.
     Life is fine!      Fine as wine!      Life is fine!","I went down to the river, set down on the bank, and jumped in. I tried to think but couldn't, so I jumped in and sank. If that water hadn't a-been so cold, I might've sunk and died."
"As You Like It, Act II, Scene VII [All the world's a stage]","Jaques to Duke Senior
                   
                          All the world's a stage,
And all the men and women merely players;
They have their exits and their entrances,
And one man in his time plays many parts,
His acts being seven ages. At first, the infant,
Mewling and puking in the nurse's arms.
Then the whining schoolboy, with his satchel
And shining morning face, creeping like snail
Unwillingly to school. And then the lover,
Sighing like furnace, with a woeful ballad
Made to his mistress' eyebrow. Then a soldier,
Full of strange oaths and bearded like the pard,
Jealous in honor, sudden and quick in quarrel,
Seeking the bubble reputation
Even in the cannon's mouth. And then the justice,
In fair round belly with good capon lined,
With eyes severe and beard of formal cut,
Full of wise saws and modern instances;
And so he plays his part. The sixth age shifts
Into the lean and slippered pantaloon,
With spectacles on nose and pouch on side;
His youthful hose, well saved, a world too wide
For his shrunk shank, and his big manly voice,
Turning again toward childish treble, pipes
And whistles in his sound. Last scene of all,
That ends this strange eventful history,
Is second childishness and mere oblivion,
Sans teeth, sans eyes, sans taste, sans everything.
 ","Jaques to Duke Senior is a play by French playwright Frida Ghitis. The play is about a man who plays seven different roles in his life. Ghitis: ""One man in his time plays many parts, his acts being seven ages"""
Shall I compare thee to a summer’s day? (Sonnet 18),"Shall I compare thee to a summer’s day?
Thou art more lovely and more temperate.
Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,
And summer’s lease hath all too short a date.
Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,
And often is his gold complexion dimmed;
And every fair from fair sometime declines,
By chance, or nature’s changing course, untrimmed;
But thy eternal summer shall not fade,
Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow’st,
Nor shall death brag thou wand'rest in his shade,
When in eternal lines to Time thou grow'st.
    So long as men can breathe, or eyes can see,
    So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.","A summer's day is more lovely and more temperate than a winter's day. So long as men can breathe, or eyes can see, so long lives this, and this gives life to thee."
To My Dear and Loving Husband,"If ever two were one, then surely we.
If ever man were loved by wife, then thee;
If ever wife was happy in a man,
Compare with me ye women if you can.
I prize thy love more than whole mines of gold,
Or all the riches that the East doth hold.
My love is such that rivers cannot quench,
Nor ought but love from thee give recompense.
Thy love is such I can no way repay;
The heavens reward thee manifold, I pray.
Then while we live, in love let’s so persever,
That when we live no more we may live ever.","I prize thy love more than whole mines of gold,                Or all the riches that the East doth hold.                My love is such that rivers cannot quench,                Nor ought but love from thee give recompense.                If ever man were loved by wife, then thee.                Compare with me ye women if you can."
A Dream Within a Dream,"Take this kiss upon the brow!
And, in parting from you now,
Thus much let me avow:
You are not wrong who deem
That my days have been a dream;
Yet if hope has flown away
In a night, or in a day,
In a vision, or in none,
Is it therefore the less gone?
All that we see or seem
Is but a dream within a dream.
I stand amid the roar
Of a surf-tormented shore,
And I hold within my hand
Grains of the golden sand--
How few! yet how they creep
Through my fingers to the deep,
While I weep--while I weep!
O God! can I not grasp
Them with a tighter clasp?
O God! can I not save
One from the pitiless wave?
Is all that we see or seem
But a dream within a dream?","""All that we see or seemIs but a dream within a dream"" ""I stand amid the roar of a surf-tormented shore,And I hold within my hand the golden sand"" ""O God! can I not save one from the pitiless wave?"""
The More Loving One,"Looking up at the stars, I know quite well
That, for all they care, I can go to hell,
But on earth indifference is the least
We have to dread from man or beast.
How should we like it were stars to burn
With a passion for us we could not return?
If equal affection cannot be,
Let the more loving one be me.
Admirer as I think I am
Of stars that do not give a damn,
I cannot, now I see them, say
I missed one terribly all day.
Were all stars to disappear or die,
I should learn to look at an empty sky
And feel its total dark sublime,
Though this might take me a little time.","""I know quite well that, for all they care, I can go to hell,"" writes the poet. "" indifference is the least we have to dread from man or beast,"" he adds."
Ulysses,"It little profits that an idle king,
By this still hearth, among these barren crags,
Matched with an aged wife, I mete and dole
Unequal laws unto a savage race,
That hoard, and sleep, and feed, and know not me.
I cannot rest from travel; I will drink
Life to the lees. All times I have enjoyed
Greatly, have suffered greatly, both with those
That loved me, and alone; on shore, and when
Through scudding drifts the rainy Hyades
Vext the dim sea. I am become a name;
For always roaming with a hungry heart
Much have I seen and known—cities of men
And manners, climates, councils, governments,
Myself not least, but honored of them all,—
And drunk delight of battle with my peers,
Far on the ringing plains of windy Troy.
I am a part of all that I have met;
Yet all experience is an arch wherethrough
Gleams that untraveled world whose margin fades
For ever and for ever when I move.
How dull it is to pause, to make an end,
To rust unburnished, not to shine in use!
As though to breathe were life! Life piled on life
Were all too little, and of one to me
Little remains; but every hour is saved
From that eternal silence, something more,
A bringer of new things; and vile it were
For some three suns to store and hoard myself,
And this gray spirit yearning in desire
To follow knowledge like a sinking star,
Beyond the utmost bound of human thought.
   This is my son, mine own Telemachus,
To whom I leave the scepter and the isle,
Well-loved of me, discerning to fulfill
This labor, by slow prudence to make mild
A rugged people, and through soft degrees
Subdue them to the useful and the good.
Most blameless is he, centered in the sphere
Of common duties, decent not to fail
In offices of tenderness, and pay
Meet adoration to my household gods,
When I am gone. He works his work, I mine.
   There lies the port; the vessel puffs her sail;
There gloom the dark, broad seas. My mariners,
Souls that have toiled, and wrought, and thought with me,
That ever with a frolic welcome took
The thunder and the sunshine, and opposed
Free hearts, free foreheads—you and I are old;
Old age hath yet his honor and his toil.
Death closes all; but something ere the end,
Some work of noble note, may yet be done,
Not unbecoming men that strove with gods.
The lights begin to twinkle from the rocks;
The long day wanes; the slow moon climbs; the deep
Moans round with many voices. Come, my friends,
'Tis not too late to seek a newer world.
Push off, and sitting well in order smite
The sounding furrows; for my purpose holds
To sail beyond the sunset, and the baths
Of all the western stars, until I die.
It may be that the gulfs will wash us down;
It may be we shall touch the Happy Isles,
And see the great Achilles, whom we knew.
Though much is taken, much abides; and though
We are not now that strength which in old days
Moved earth and heaven, that which we are, we are,
One equal temper of heroic hearts,
Made weak by time and fate, but strong in will
To strive, to seek, to find, and not to yield.","""I am become a name; always roaming with a hungry heart,"" he writes. ""All times I have enjoyed, have suffered greatly, both with those that loved me, and alone,"" he adds. ""I cannot rest from travel; I will drink life to the lees,"" he says."
Archaic Torso of Apollo,"We cannot know his legendary head
with eyes like ripening fruit. And yet his torso
is still suffused with brilliance from inside,
like a lamp, in which his gaze, now turned to low,
gleams in all its power. Otherwise
the curved breast could not dazzle you so, nor could
a smile run through the placid hips and thighs
to that dark center where procreation flared.
Otherwise this stone would seem defaced
beneath the translucent cascade of the shoulders
and would not glisten like a wild beast's fur:
would not, from all the borders of itself,
burst like a star: for here there is no place
that does not see you. You must change your life.","We cannot know his legendary head                with eyes like ripening fruit. And yet his torso                is still suffused with brilliance from inside,                like a lamp, in which his gaze, now turned to low, is in all its power."
Greensickness,"after Gwendolyn Brooks
My wild grief didn’t know where to end.
Everywhere I looked: a field alive and unburied.
Whole swaths of green swallowed the light.
All around me, the field was growing. I grew out
My hair in every direction. Let the sun freckle my face.
Even in the greenest depths, I crouched
Towards the light. That summer, everything grew
So alive and so alone. A world hushed in green.
Wildest grief grew inside out.
I crawled to the field’s edge, bruises blooming
In every crevice of my palms.
I didn’t know I’d reached a shoreline till I felt it
There: A salt wind lifted
The hair from my neck.
At the edge of every green lies an ocean.
When I saw that blue, I knew then:
This world will end.
Grief is not the only geography I know.
Every wound closes. Repair comes with sweetness,
Come spring. Every empire will fall:
I must believe this. I felt it
Somewhere in the field: my ancestors
Murmuring Go home, go home—soon, soon.
No country wants me back anymore and I’m okay.
If grief is love with nowhere to go, then
Oh, I’ve loved so immensely.
That summer, everything I touched
Was green. All bruises will fade
From green and blue to skin.
Let me grow through this green
And not drown in it.
Let me be lawless and beloved,
Ungovernable and unafraid.
Let me be brave enough to live here.
Let me be precise in my actions.
Let me feel hurt.
I know I can heal.
Let me try again—again and again.","Gwendolyn Brooks wrote a book about her grief after the death of her husband. Brooks: “My wild grief didn’t know where to end. That summer, everything grew green.”"

In This Place (An American Lyric),"An original poem written for the inaugural reading of Poet Laureate Tracy K. Smith at the Library of Congress.
There’s a poem in this place—
in the footfalls in the halls
in the quiet beat of the seats.
It is here, at the curtain of day,
where America writes a lyric
you must whisper to say.
There’s a poem in this place—
in the heavy grace,
the lined face of this noble building,
collections burned and reborn twice.
There’s a poem in Boston’s Copley Square
where protest chants
tear through the air
like sheets of rain,
where love of the many
swallows hatred of the few.
There’s a poem in Charlottesville
where tiki torches string a ring of flame
tight round the wrist of night
where men so white they gleam blue—
seem like statues
where men heap that long wax burning
ever higher
where Heather Heyer
blooms forever in a meadow of resistance.
There’s a poem in the great sleeping giant
of Lake Michigan, defiantly raising
its big blue head to Milwaukee and Chicago—
a poem begun long ago, blazed into frozen soil,
strutting upward and aglow.
There’s a poem in Florida, in East Texas
where streets swell into a nexus
of rivers, cows afloat like mottled buoys in the brown,
where courage is now so common
that 23-year-old Jesus Contreras rescues people from floodwaters.
There’s a poem in Los Angeles
yawning wide as the Pacific tide
where a single mother swelters
in a windowless classroom, teaching
black and brown students in Watts
to spell out their thoughts
so her daughter might write
this poem for you.             
There's a lyric in California
where thousands of students march for blocks,
undocumented and unafraid;
where my friend Rosa finds the power to blossom
in deadlock, her spirit the bedrock of her community.
She knows hope is like a stubborn
ship gripping a dock,
a truth: that you can’t stop a dreamer
or knock down a dream.
How could this not be her city
su nación
our country
our America,
our American lyric to write—
a poem by the people, the poor,
the Protestant, the Muslim, the Jew,
the native, the immigrant,
the black, the brown, the blind, the brave,
the undocumented and undeterred,
the woman, the man, the nonbinary,
the white, the trans,
the ally to all of the above
and more?
Tyrants fear the poet.
Now that we know it
we can’t blow it.
We owe it
to show it
not slow it
although it
hurts to sew it
when the world
skirts below it.       
Hope—
we must bestow it
like a wick in the poet
so it can grow, lit,
bringing with it
stories to rewrite—
the story of a Texas city depleted but not defeated
a history written that need not be repeated
a nation composed but not yet completed.
There’s a poem in this place—
a poem in America
a poet in every American
who rewrites this nation, who tells
a story worthy of being told on this minnow of an earth
to breathe hope into a palimpsest of time—
a poet in every American
who sees that our poem penned
doesn’t mean our poem’s end.
There’s a place where this poem dwells—
it is here, it is now, in the yellow song of dawn’s bell
where we write an American lyric
we are just beginning to tell.","An original poem written for the inaugural reading of Poet Laureate Tracy K. Smith at the Library of Congress. There’s a poem in this place, in the footfalls in the halls and the quiet beat of the seats, the poet writes."
On Self-Knowledge,"And a man said, Speak to us of Self-Knowledge.
And he answered, saying:
Your hearts know in silence the secrets of the days and the nights.
But your ears thirst for the sound of your heart’s knowledge.
You would know in words that which you have always known in thought.
You would touch with your fingers the naked body of your dreams.
And it is well you should.
The hidden well-spring of your soul must needs rise and run murmuring to the sea;
And the treasure of your infinite depths would be revealed to your eyes.
But let there be no scales ot weigh your unknown treasure;
And seek not the depths of your knowledge with staff or sounding line.
For self is a sea boundless and measureless.
Say not, “I have found the truth,” but rather, “I have found a truth.” 
Say not, ""I have found the path of the soul.” Say rather, “I have met the soul walking upon my path.”
For the soul walks upon all paths.
The soul walks not upon a line, neither does it grow like a reed.
The soul unfolds itself, like a lotus of countless petals.","A man said, Speak to us of Self-Knowledge. And he answered, saying, Your hearts know in silence the secrets of the days and the nights."
The Raincoat,"When the doctor suggested surgery
and a brace for all my youngest years,
my parents scrambled to take me
to massage therapy, deep tissue work,
osteopathy, and soon my crooked spine
unspooled a bit, I could breathe again,
and move more in a body unclouded
by pain. My mom would tell me to sing
songs to her the whole forty-five minute
drive to Middle Two Rock Road and forty-
five minutes back from physical therapy.
She’d say, even my voice sounded unfettered
by my spine afterward. So I sang and sang,
because I thought she liked it. I never
asked her what she gave up to drive me,
or how her day was before this chore. Today,
at her age, I was driving myself home from yet
another spine appointment, singing along
to some maudlin but solid song on the radio,
and I saw a mom take her raincoat off
and give it to her young daughter when
a storm took over the afternoon. My god,
I thought, my whole life I’ve been under her
raincoat thinking it was somehow a marvel
that I never got wet.","When he was a child, a doctor suggested surgery and a brace for his crooked spine. His parents took him to massage therapy, deep tissue work, and soon he could breathe again. Today, he was driving himself home from another spine appointment, singing along with the radio."
Love at First Sight,"They’re both convinced
that a sudden passion joined them.
Such certainty is beautiful,
but uncertainty is more beautiful still.
Since they’d never met before, they’re sure
that there’d been nothing between them.
But what’s the word from the streets, staircases, hallways—
perhaps they’ve passed by each other a million times?
I want to ask them
if they don’t remember—
a moment face to face
in some revolving door?
perhaps a “sorry” muttered in a crowd?
a curt “wrong number” caught in the receiver?—
but I know the answer.
No, they don’t remember.
They’d be amazed to hear
that Chance has been toying with them
now for years.
Not quite ready yet
to become their Destiny,
it pushed them close, drove them apart,
it barred their path,
stifling a laugh,
and then leaped aside.
There were signs and signals,
even if they couldn’t read them yet.
Perhaps three years ago
or just last Tuesday
a certain leaf fluttered
from one shoulder to another?
Something was dropped and then picked up.
Who knows, maybe the ball that vanished
into childhood’s thicket?
There were doorknobs and doorbells
where one touch had covered another
beforehand.
Suitcases checked and standing side by side.
One night, perhaps, the same dream,
grown hazy by morning.
Every beginning
is only a sequel, after all,
and the book of events
is always open halfway through.","They’re both convinced that a sudden passion joined them. But what’s the word from the streets, staircases, hallways? Perhaps they’ve passed by each other a million times."
The Fish,"I caught a tremendous fish
and held him beside the boat
half out of water, with my hook
fast in a corner of his mouth.
He didn't fight.
He hadn't fought at all.
He hung a grunting weight,
battered and venerable
and homely. Here and there
his brown skin hung in strips
like ancient wallpaper,
and its pattern of darker brown
was like wallpaper:
shapes like full-blown roses
stained and lost through age.
He was speckled with barnacles,
fine rosettes of lime,
and infested
with tiny white sea-lice,
and underneath two or three
rags of green weed hung down.
While his gills were breathing in
the terrible oxygen
—the frightening gills,
fresh and crisp with blood,
that can cut so badly—
I thought of the coarse white flesh
packed in like feathers,
the big bones and the little bones,
the dramatic reds and blacks
of his shiny entrails,
and the pink swim-bladder
like a big peony.
I looked into his eyes
which were far larger than mine
but shallower, and yellowed,
the irises backed and packed
with tarnished tinfoil
seen through the lenses
of old scratched isinglass.
They shifted a little, but not
to return my stare.
—It was more like the tipping
of an object toward the light.
I admired his sullen face,
the mechanism of his jaw,
and then I saw
that from his lower lip
—if you could call it a lip—
grim, wet, and weaponlike,
hung five old pieces of fish-line,
or four and a wire leader
with the swivel still attached,
with all their five big hooks
grown firmly in his mouth.
A green line, frayed at the end
where he broke it, two heavier lines,
and a fine black thread
still crimped from the strain and snap
when it broke and he got away.
Like medals with their ribbons
frayed and wavering,
a five-haired beard of wisdom
trailing from his aching jaw.
I stared and stared
and victory filled up
the little rented boat,
from the pool of bilge
where oil had spread a rainbow
around the rusted engine
to the bailer rusted orange,
the sun-cracked thwarts,
the oarlocks on their strings,
the gunnels—until everything
was rainbow, rainbow, rainbow!
And I let the fish go.","I caught a tremendous fish and held him beside the boat. He didn't fight at all. He hung a grunting weight,battered and venerable. His brown skin hung in strips like ancient wallpaper."
How I Am,"When I talk to my friends I pretend I am standing on the wings 

of a flying plane. I cannot be trusted to tell them how I am. 
Or if I am falling to earth weighing less 

than a dozen roses. Sometimes I dream they have broken up 

with their lovers and are carrying food to my house. 
When I open the mailbox I hear their voices 

like the long upward-winding curve of a train whistle 

passing through the tall grasses and ferns 
after the train has passed. I never get ahead of their shadows. 

I embrace them in front of moving cars. I keep them away 

from my miseries because to say I am miserable is to say I am like them. ",When I talk to my friends I pretend I am standing on the wings of a flying plane. I cannot be trusted to tell them how I am. Sometimes I dream they have broken up with their lovers and are carrying food.
Dream Song 4,"Filling her compact & delicious body
with chicken páprika, she glanced at me
twice.
Fainting with interest, I hungered back
and only the fact of her husband & four other people
kept me from springing on her

or falling at her little feet and crying
'You are the hottest one for years of night
Henry's dazed eyes
have enjoyed, Brilliance.' I advanced upon
(despairing) my spumoni.—Sir Bones: is stuffed,
de world, wif feeding girls.

—Black hair, complexion Latin, jewelled eyes
downcast . . . The slob beside her     feasts . . . What wonders is
she sitting on, over there?
The restaurant buzzes.  She might as well be on Mars.
Where did it all go wrong? There ought to be a law against Henry.
—Mr. Bones: there is.","'You are the hottest one for years of night,' Henry's dazed eyes said. 'There ought to be a law against Henry'"
Dream Song 29,"There sat down, once, a thing on Henry's heart
só heavy, if he had a hundred years
& more, & weeping, sleepless, in all them time
Henry could not make good.
Starts again always in Henry's ears
the little cough somewhere, an odour, a chime.

And there is another thing he has in mind
like a grave Sienese face a thousand years
would fail to blur the still profiled reproach of.  Ghastly,
with open eyes, he attends, blind.
All the bells say: too late.  This is not for tears;
thinking.

But never did Henry, as he thought he did,
end anyone and hacks her body up
and hide the pieces, where they may be found.
He knows: he went over everyone, & nobody's missing.
Often he reckons, in the dawn, them up.
Nobody is ever missing.","Henry could not make good. There sat down, once, a thing on Henry's heart, if he had a hundred years                & more, & weeping, sleepless, in all them time."
Jabberwocky,"’Twas brillig, and the slithy toves
   Did gyre and gimble in the wabe;
All mimsy were the borogoves,
   And the mome raths outgrabe.
“Beware the Jabberwock, my son
   The jaws that bite, the claws that catch!
Beware the Jubjub bird, and shun
   The frumious Bandersnatch!”
He took his vorpal sword in hand;
   Long time the manxome foe he sought—
So rested he by the Tumtum tree,
   And stood awhile in thought.
And, as in uffish thought he stood,
   The Jabberwock, with eyes of flame,
Came whiffling through the tulgey wood,
   And burbled as it came!
One, two! One, two! And through and through
   The vorpal blade went snicker-snack!
He left it dead, and with its head
   He went galumphing back.
“And hast thou slain the Jabberwock?
   Come to my arms, my beamish boy!
O frabjous day! Callooh! Callay!”
   He chortled in his joy.
’Twas brillig, and the slithy toves
   Did gyre and gimble in the wabe;
All mimsy were the borogoves,
   And the mome raths outgrabe.","’Twas brillig, and the slithy toves774 Did gyre and gimble in the wabe;774All mimsy were the borogoves,774   And the mome raths outgrabe.774 ‘Beware the Jabberwock, my son.774 The jaws that bite, the claws that catch!774 Beware the Jubjub bird, and shun the Bandersnatch!774"
"In Memoriam, [Ring out, wild bells]","Ring out, wild bells, to the wild sky,
   The flying cloud, the frosty light:

   The year is going, let him go;
Ring out the false, ring in the true.
Ring out the grief that saps the mind

With sweeter manners, purer laws.

Mother to Son,"Well, son, I’ll tell you: 
Life for me ain’t been no crystal stair.
It’s had tacks in it,
And splinters,
And boards torn up,
And places with no carpet on the floor—
Bare;
But all the time
I’se been a’climbin’ on,
And reachin’ landin’s,
And turnin’ corners, 
And sometimes goin’ in the dark, 
Where there ain’t been no light.
So boy, don’t you turn back;
Don’t you sit down on the steps, 
’Cause you finds it’s kinder hard;
Don’t you fall now—
For I’se still goin’, honey,
I’se still climbin’,

The Index,"In the beginning there was darkness,
then a bunch of other stuff—and lots of people.
Some things were said and loosely interpreted,
or maybe things were not communicated clearly.
Regardless—there has always been an index.
That thing about the meek—how we
shall inherit the earth; that was a promise
made in a treaty at the dawn of time
agreed upon in primordial darkness                
and documented in the spiritual record.
The nature of the agreement was thus:
The world will seemingly be pushed past capacity.
A new planet will be “discovered” 31 light-years away.   
Space travel will advance rapidly,
making the journey feasible. The ice sheets will melt.
Things will get ugly. The only way to leave
will be to buy a ticket. Tickets will be priced at exactly
the amount that can be accrued
by abandoning basic humanity.
The index will show how you came by your fortune:            
If you murdered, trafficked or exploited the vulnerable,
stole, embezzled, poisoned, cheated, swindled,
or otherwise subdued nature to come by wealth
great enough to afford passage to the new earth;
if your ancestors did these things and you’ve done nothing
to benefit from their crimes yet do nothing to atone
through returning inherited wealth to the greater good
you shall be granted passage. It was agreed.
The meek shall stay, the powerful shall leave.
And it all shall start again.
The meek shall inherit the earth,
and what shall we do with it,
but set about putting aside our meekness?",The meek shall inherit the earth; that was a promise made in a treaty at the dawn of time. Tickets will be priced at exactly the amount that can be accrued by abandoning basic humanity.
On Children,"And a woman who held a babe against her bosom said, Speak to us of Children.
     And he said:
     Your children are not your children.
     They are the sons and daughters of Life’s longing for itself.
     They come through you but not from you,
     And though they are with you yet they belong not to you.
     You may give them your love but not your thoughts,
     For they have their own thoughts.
     You may house their bodies but not their souls,
     For their souls dwell in the house of tomorrow, which you cannot visit, not even in your dreams.
     You may strive to be like them, but seek not to make them like you.
     For life goes not backward nor tarries with yesterday.
     You are the bows from which your children as living arrows are sent forth.
     The archer sees the mark upon the path of the infinite, and He bends you with His might that His arrows may go swift and far.
     Let your bending in the archer’s hand be for gladness;
     For even as He loves the arrow that flies, so He loves also the bow that is stable.","A woman held a babe against her bosom said, Speak to us of Children. He said: Your children are not your children. They are the sons and daughters of Life’s longing for itself."
Moonlily,"(Mather AFB, California, 1956)

When we play horses at recess, my name
is Moonlily and I’m a yearling mare.
We gallop circles around the playground,
whinnying, neighing, and shaking our manes.
We scrape the ground with scuffed saddle oxfords,
thunder around the little kids on swings
and seesaws, and around the boys’ ball games.
We’re sorrel, chestnut, buckskin, pinto, gray,
a herd in pastel dresses and white socks.
We’re self-named, untamed, untouched, unridden.
Our plains know no fences. We can smell spring.
The bell produces metamorphosis.
Still hot and flushed, we file back to our desks,
one bay in a room of palominos.","Moonlily and I are a yearling mare. We gallop circles around the playground,whinnying, neighing, and shaking our manes. Our plains know no fences. We can smell spring."
A Small Needful Fact,"Is that Eric Garner worked
for some time for the Parks and Rec.
Horticultural Department, which means,
perhaps, that with his very large hands,
perhaps, in all likelihood,
he put gently into the earth
some plants which, most likely,
some of them, in all likelihood,
continue to grow, continue
to do what such plants do, like house
and feed small and necessary creatures,
like being pleasant to touch and smell,
like converting sunlight
into food, like making it easier
for us to breathe.","Eric Garner worked for some time for the Parks and Rec. Department. Perhaps, with his large hands, he put gently into the earth some plants which, most likely, continue to grow."
So Much Happiness,"It is difficult to know what to do with so much happiness.
With sadness there is something to rub against,
a wound to tend with lotion and cloth.
When the world falls in around you, you have pieces to pick up,
something to hold in your hands, like ticket stubs or change.
But happiness floats.
It doesn’t need you to hold it down.
It doesn’t need anything.
Happiness lands on the roof of the next house, singing,
and disappears when it wants to.
You are happy either way.
Even the fact that you once lived in a peaceful tree house
and now live over a quarry of noise and dust
cannot make you unhappy.
Everything has a life of its own,
it too could wake up filled with possibilities
of coffee cake and ripe peaches,
and love even the floor which needs to be swept,
the soiled linens and scratched records . . .
Since there is no place large enough
to contain so much happiness,
you shrug, you raise your hands, and it flows out of you
into everything you touch. You are not responsible.
You take no credit, as the night sky takes no credit
for the moon, but continues to hold it, and share it,
and in that way, be known.","Happiness floats. It doesn’t need you to hold it down. With sadness there is something to rub against, a wound to tend with lotion and cloth."
The Power of the Dog,"There is sorrow enough in the natural way
From men and women to fill our day;
And when we are certain of sorrow in store,
Why do we always arrange for more?
Brothers and Sisters, I bid you beware
Of giving your heart to a dog to tear.
Buy a pup and your money will buy
Love unflinching that cannot lie—
Perfect passion and worship fed
By a kick in the ribs or a pat on the head.
Nevertheless it is hardly fair
To risk your heart for a dog to tear.
When the fourteen years which Nature permits
Are closing in asthma, or tumour, or fits,
And the vet’s unspoken prescription runs
To lethal chambers or loaded guns,
Then you will find—it’s your own affair—
But… you’ve given your heart to a dog to tear.
When the body that lived at your single will,
With its whimper of welcome, is stilled (how still!).
When the spirit that answered your every mood
Is gone—wherever it goes—for good,
You will discover how much you care,
And will give your heart to a dog to tear.
We’ve sorrow enough in the natural way,
When it comes to burying Christian clay.
Our loves are not given, but only lent,
At compound interest of cent per cent.
Though it is not always the case, I believe,
That the longer we’ve kept ’em, the more do we grieve:
For, when debts are payable, right or wrong,
A short-time loan is as bad as a long—
So why in—Heaven (before we are there)
Should we give our hearts to a dog to tear?","""When the body that lived at your single will, is stilled (how still), you will find that you have given your heart to a dog to tear"""
Kindness,"Before you know what kindness really is
you must lose things,
feel the future dissolve in a moment
like salt in a weakened broth.
What you held in your hand,
what you counted and carefully saved,
all this must go so you know
how desolate the landscape can be
between the regions of kindness.
How you ride and ride
thinking the bus will never stop,
the passengers eating maize and chicken
will stare out the window forever.
Before you learn the tender gravity of kindness
you must travel where the Indian in a white poncho
lies dead by the side of the road.
You must see how this could be you,
how he too was someone
who journeyed through the night with plans
and the simple breath that kept him alive.
Before you know kindness as the deepest thing inside,
you must know sorrow as the other deepest thing.
You must wake up with sorrow.
You must speak to it till your voice
catches the thread of all sorrows
and you see the size of the cloth.
Then it is only kindness that makes sense anymore,
only kindness that ties your shoes
and sends you out into the day to gaze at bread,
only kindness that raises its head
from the crowd of the world to say
It is I you have been looking for,
and then goes with you everywhere
like a shadow or a friend.","Before you know what kindness really is, you must lose things. You must feel the future dissolve in a moment like salt in a weakened broth. Only kindness that makes sense anymore is kindness that ties your shoes and sends you out into the day."

"Hamlet, Act III, Scene I [To be, or not to be]","To be, or not to be: that is the question:
Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer
The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune,
Or to take arms against a sea of troubles,
And by opposing end them? To die: to sleep;
No more; and by a sleep to say we end
The heart-ache and the thousand natural shocks
That flesh is heir to, 'tis a consummation
Devoutly to be wish'd. To die, to sleep;
To sleep: perchance to dream: ay, there's the rub;
For in that sleep of death what dreams may come
When we have shuffled off this mortal coil,
Must give us pause: there's the respect
That makes calamity of so long life;
For who would bear the whips and scorns of time,
The oppressor's wrong, the proud man's contumely,
The pangs of despised love, the law's delay,
The insolence of office and the spurns
That patient merit of the unworthy takes,
When he himself might his quietus make
With a bare bodkin? who would fardels bear,
To grunt and sweat under a weary life,
But that the dread of something after death,
The undiscover'd country from whose bourn
No traveller returns, puzzles the will
And makes us rather bear those ills we have
Than fly to others that we know not of?
Thus conscience does make cowards of us all;
And thus the native hue of resolution
Is sicklied o'er with the pale cast of thought,
And enterprises of great pith and moment
With this regard their currents turn awry,
And lose the name of action.—Soft you now!

Of myself forever reproaching myself, (for who more foolish than I, and who more faithless?)

Leaves,"                        1 

Every October it becomes important, no, necessary
to see the leaves turning, to be surrounded
by leaves turning; it's not just the symbolism,
to confront in the death of the year your death,
one blazing farewell appearance, though the irony 
isn't lost on you that nature is most seductive
when it's about to die, flaunting the dazzle of its 
incipient exit, an ending that at least so far 
the effects of human progress (pollution, acid rain)
have not yet frightened you enough to make you believe
is real; that is, you know this ending is a deception
because of course nature is always renewing itself—
        the trees don't die, they just pretend,
        go out in style, and return in style: a new style.





                        2 

Is it deliberate how far they make you go
especially if you live in the city to get far 
enough away from home to see not just trees 
but only trees? The boring highways, roadsigns, high 
speeds, 10-axle trucks passing you as if they were 
in an even greater hurry than you to look at leaves:
so you drive in terror for literal hours and it looks 
like rain, or snow, but it's probably just clouds
(too cloudy to see any color?) and you wonder, 
given the poverty of your memory, which road had the 
most color last year, but it doesn't matter since 
you're probably too late anyway, or too early—
        whichever road you take will be the wrong one
        and you've probably come all this way for nothing.






                        3 

You'll be driving along depressed when suddenly
a cloud will move and the sun will muscle through
and ignite the hills. It may not last. Probably
won't last. But for a moment the whole world
comes to. Wakes up. Proves it lives. It lives—
red, yellow, orange, brown, russet, ocher, vermilion,
gold. Flame and rust. Flame and rust, the permutations
of burning. You're on fire. Your eyes are on fire.
It won't last, you don't want it to last. You 
can't stand any more. But you don't want it to stop. 
It's what you've come for. It's what you'll
come back for. It won't stay with you, but you'll 
        remember that it felt like nothing else you've felt
        or something you've felt that also didn't last.","Every October it becomes important, no, necessary, to see the leaves turning, to be surrounded by leaves turning. It's not just the symbolism, it's the chance to confront in the death of the year your death, one blazing farewell appearance."
The Swing,"How do you like to go up in a swing, 
             Up in the air so blue? 
Oh, I do think it the pleasantest thing 
             Ever a child can do! 

Up in the air and over the wall, 
             Till I can see so wide, 
River and trees and cattle and all 
             Over the countryside—

Till I look down on the garden green, 
              Down on the roof so brown—
Up in the air I go flying again, 
              Up in the air and down!","""Up in the air and over the wall"" is one of the most popular songs of the 20th century. The song was written by the German children's writer Hans Hofmann in the 1930s and 1940s."
Nothing Gold Can Stay,"Nature’s first green is gold,
Her hardest hue to hold.
Her early leaf’s a flower;
But only so an hour.
Then leaf subsides to leaf.
So Eden sank to grief,
So dawn goes down to day.
Nothing gold can stay.","Nature's first green is gold, her hardest hue to hold. But only so an hour. Then leaf subsides to leaf. Eden sank to grief, so dawn goes down to day."
In Flanders Fields,"In Flanders fields the poppies blow
Between the crosses, row on row,
    That mark our place; and in the sky
    The larks, still bravely singing, fly
Scarce heard amid the guns below.
We are the Dead. Short days ago
We lived, felt dawn, saw sunset glow,
    Loved and were loved, and now we lie
        In Flanders fields.
Take up our quarrel with the foe: 
To you from failing hands we throw
    The torch; be yours to hold it high. 
    If ye break faith with us who die
We shall not sleep, though poppies grow
        In Flanders fields.","In Flanders fields the poppies blow between the crosses, row on row, that mark our place. The larks, still bravely singing, fly, heard amid the guns below."
I Hear an Army,"I hear an army charging upon the land,   
  And the thunder of horses plunging, foam about their knees:   
Arrogant, in black armour, behind them stand,   
  Disdaining the reins, with fluttering whips, the charioteers.   
   
They cry unto the night their battle-name:        
  I moan in sleep when I hear afar their whirling laughter.   
They cleave the gloom of dreams, a blinding flame,   
  Clanging, clanging upon the heart as upon an anvil.   
   
They come shaking in triumph their long, green hair:   
  They come out of the sea and run shouting by the shore. 
My heart, have you no wisdom thus to despair?   
  My love, my love, my love, why have you left me alone?","I hear an army charging upon the land, and the thunder of horses plunging, foam about their knees. I moan in sleep when I hear afar their whirling laughter. They cleave the gloom of dreams, a blinding flame."
"Wynken, Blynken, and Nod","Wynken, Blynken, and Nod one night
   Sailed off in a wooden shoe,—
Sailed on a river of crystal light
   Into a sea of dew.
""Where are you going, and what do you wish?""
   The old moon asked the three.
""We have come to fish for the herring-fish
   That live in this beautiful sea;
   Nets of silver and gold have we,""
            Said Wynken,
            Blynken,
            And Nod.
The old moon laughed and sang a song,
   As they rocked in the wooden shoe;
And the wind that sped them all night long
   Ruffled the waves of dew;
The little stars were the herring-fish
   That lived in the beautiful sea.
""Now cast your nets wherever you wish,—
   Never afraid are we!""
   So cried the stars to the fishermen three,
            Wynken,
            Blynken,
            And Nod.
All night long their nets they threw
   To the stars in the twinkling foam,—
Then down from the skies came the wooden shoe,
   Bringing the fishermen home:
'Twas all so pretty a sail, it seemed
   As if it could not be;
And some folk thought 'twas a dream they'd dreamed
   Of sailing that beautiful sea;
   But I shall name you the fishermen three:
            Wynken,
            Blynken,
            And Nod.
Wynken and Blynken are two little eyes,
   And Nod is a little head,
And the wooden shoe that sailed the skies
   Is a wee one's trundle-bed;
So shut your eyes while Mother sings
   Of wonderful sights that be,
And you shall see the beautiful things
   As you rock in the misty sea
   Where the old shoe rocked the fishermen three:—
            Wynken,
            Blynken,
            And Nod.","Wynken, Blynken, and Nod one night sailed off in a wooden shoe. The old moon laughed and sang a song. The fishermen three cast their nets wherever they wished."

Be Glad Your Nose Is on Your Face,"Be glad your nose is on your face,

you might dislike your nose a lot.

Your nose would be a source of dread

At Pegasus,"They are like those crazy women

these men grinding
   in the strobe & black lights
      of Pegasus. All shadow & sound.

""I'm just here for the music,"" 
   I tell the man who asks me
      to the floor. But I have held

a boy on my back before.
   Curtis & I used to leap
      barefoot into the creek; dance

among maggots & piss,
   beer bottles & tadpoles
      slippery as sperm;

we used to pull off our shirts, 
   & slap music into our skin.
      He wouldn't know me now
   
at the edge of these lovers' gyre, 
   glitter & steam, fire,
      bodies blurred sexless

by the music's spinning light.

      into the mouth of an old one,

& I am not that far away.
   The whole scene raw & delicate 
      as Curtis's foot gashed

on a sunken bottle shard. 
   They press hip to hip,

carrying a friend on his back. 
   The foot swelling green
      as the sewage in that creek.

We never went back.
   But I remember his weight 
      better than I remember

my first kiss.
   These men know something
      I used to know.

How could I not find them

      into each other,

the way the dance floor

Still I Rise,"You may write me down in history
With your bitter, twisted lies,
You may trod me in the very dirt
But still, like dust, I’ll rise.
Does my sassiness upset you?
Why are you beset with gloom?
’Cause I walk like I’ve got oil wells
Pumping in my living room.
Just like moons and like suns,
With the certainty of tides,
Just like hopes springing high,
Still I’ll rise.
Did you want to see me broken?
Bowed head and lowered eyes?
Shoulders falling down like teardrops,
Weakened by my soulful cries?
Does my haughtiness offend you?
Don’t you take it awful hard
’Cause I laugh like I’ve got gold mines
Diggin’ in my own backyard.
You may shoot me with your words,
You may cut me with your eyes,
You may kill me with your hatefulness,
But still, like air, I’ll rise.
Does my sexiness upset you?
Does it come as a surprise
That I dance like I’ve got diamonds
At the meeting of my thighs?
Out of the huts of history’s shame
I rise
Up from a past that’s rooted in pain
I rise
I’m a black ocean, leaping and wide,
Welling and swelling I bear in the tide.
Leaving behind nights of terror and fear
I rise
Into a daybreak that’s wondrously clear
I rise
Bringing the gifts that my ancestors gave,
I am the dream and the hope of the slave.
I rise
I rise

The New Colossus,"Not like the brazen giant of Greek fame,
With conquering limbs astride from land to land;
Here at our sea-washed, sunset gates shall stand
A mighty woman with a torch, whose flame
Is the imprisoned lightning, and her name
Mother of Exiles. From her beacon-hand
Glows world-wide welcome; her mild eyes command
The air-bridged harbor that twin cities frame.
“Keep, ancient lands, your storied pomp!” cries she
With silent lips. “Give me your tired, your poor,
Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free,
The wretched refuse of your teeming shore.
Send these, the homeless, tempest-tost to me,
I lift my lamp beside the golden door!”","A mighty woman with a torch, whose flame                Is the imprisoned lightning, and her name is Mother of Exiles. Not like the brazen giant of Greek fame, with conquering limbs astride from land to land."
Let America Be America Again,"Let America be America again.
Let it be the dream it used to be.
Let it be the pioneer on the plain
Seeking a home where he himself is free.
(America never was America to me.)
Let America be the dream the dreamers dreamed—
Let it be that great strong land of love
Where never kings connive nor tyrants scheme
That any man be crushed by one above.
(It never was America to me.)
O, let my land be a land where Liberty
Is crowned with no false patriotic wreath,
But opportunity is real, and life is free,
Equality is in the air we breathe.
(There’s never been equality for me,
Nor freedom in this “homeland of the free.”)
Say, who are you that mumbles in the dark?
And who are you that draws your veil across the stars?
I am the poor white, fooled and pushed apart,
I am the Negro bearing slavery’s scars.
I am the red man driven from the land,
I am the immigrant clutching the hope I seek—
And finding only the same old stupid plan
Of dog eat dog, of mighty crush the weak.
I am the young man, full of strength and hope,
Tangled in that ancient endless chain
Of profit, power, gain, of grab the land!
Of grab the gold! Of grab the ways of satisfying need!
Of work the men! Of take the pay!
Of owning everything for one’s own greed!
I am the farmer, bondsman to the soil.
I am the worker sold to the machine.
I am the Negro, servant to you all.
I am the people, humble, hungry, mean—
Hungry yet today despite the dream.
Beaten yet today—O, Pioneers!
I am the man who never got ahead,
The poorest worker bartered through the years.
Yet I’m the one who dreamt our basic dream
In the Old World while still a serf of kings,
Who dreamt a dream so strong, so brave, so true,
That even yet its mighty daring sings
In every brick and stone, in every furrow turned
That’s made America the land it has become.
O, I’m the man who sailed those early seas
In search of what I meant to be my home—
For I’m the one who left dark Ireland’s shore,
And Poland’s plain, and England’s grassy lea,
And torn from Black Africa’s strand I came
To build a “homeland of the free.”
The free?
Who said the free? Not me?
Surely not me? The millions on relief today?
The millions shot down when we strike?
The millions who have nothing for our pay?
For all the dreams we’ve dreamed
And all the songs we’ve sung
And all the hopes we’ve held
And all the flags we’ve hung,
The millions who have nothing for our pay—
Except the dream that’s almost dead today.
O, let America be America again—
The land that never has been yet—
And yet must be—the land where every man is free.
The land that’s mine—the poor man’s, Indian’s, Negro’s, ME—
Who made America,
Whose sweat and blood, whose faith and pain,
Whose hand at the foundry, whose plow in the rain,
Must bring back our mighty dream again.
Sure, call me any ugly name you choose—
The steel of freedom does not stain.
From those who live like leeches on the people’s lives,
We must take back our land again,
America!
O, yes,
I say it plain,
America never was America to me,
And yet I swear this oath—
America will be!
Out of the rack and ruin of our gangster death,
The rape and rot of graft, and stealth, and lies,
We, the people, must redeem
The land, the mines, the plants, the rivers.
The mountains and the endless plain—
All, all the stretch of these great green states—
And make America again!","Pioneer: ""America never was America to me."" ""Let America be the dream the dreamers dreamed,"" he says. ""We must take back our land again, America!"" ""We will redeem the land, the mines, the mountains and the rivers"""
Notes from the Other Side,"I divested myself of despair
and fear when I came here.

Now there is no more catching
one's own eye in the mirror,

there are no bad books, no plastic,
no insurance premiums, and of course

no illness. Contrition 
does not exist, nor gnashing

of teeth. No one howls as the first
clod of earth hits the casket.

The poor we no longer have with us. 
Our calm hearts strike only the hour,

and God, as promised, proves
to be mercy clothed in light.","I divested myself of despairand fear when I came here. I have no more catching my own eye in the mirror.

The Splendid Body,"The splendid body is meat, flexor
and flesh pumping, pulling, anti-
gravity maverick just standing
upright all over museums and
in line for the bus and in the laundry
aisle where it’s just standing there
smelling all the detergent like
it’s no big deal. So what if a couple
of its squishy parts are suspended
within, like beach-bungled jellyfish
in a shelved jar, not doing anything?
Nothing on this side of the quantum
tunnel is perfect. The splendid body,
though, is splendid in the way
it keeps its steamy blood in, no matter
how bad it blushes. And splendid
in how it opens its mouth and
these invisible vibrations come
rippling out—if you put your wrist
right up to it when that happens
it feels somewhat like the feet
of many bees. The splendid body
loves the juniper smell of gin, loves
the warmth of printer-fresh paper,
and the sound fallen leaves make
under the wheel of a turning car.
If you touch it between the legs,
the splendid body will quicken
like bubbles in a just-on teakettle.
It knows it can’t exist forever, so
it’s collecting as many flavors as it can—
saffron, rainwater, fish-skin, chive.
Do not distract it from its purpose,
which is to feel everything it can find.","The splendid body is meat, flexor                and flesh pumping, pulling, anti-gravity maverick.

Dream Nest,"More like a basket
            of twig and hair, 
            surprisingly 
            tall
           
            and deep—
                        in a tree
            outside my bedroom
            window.
I knew 
            something lived in there
            you wouldn’t assume
                        lived in a nest.
Then I knew:
            a human lived there.
And once I knew—
            the nest, nearly 
           
            disintegrated, 
                           still in the tree. 
                                   
It wasn’t about trauma, the perfect 
            and then the broken 
                        nest 
            in which a human 
                        lived—
            Born and lit and broken
                                     comes I.","I knew something lived in a tree outside my bedroom window. It wasn’t about trauma, the perfect nest. It was more like a basket of twig and hair."
Chickens,"I come from hay and barns, raising 
chickens. In spring, lambs come. 
You got to get up, fly early, do the orphan run 
sleep till dawn, start the feeding. 
When the electricity shuts off, you boil water, you crack ice. 
You keep the animals watered. 
You walk through the barn, through the hay smell,
your hair brittle where you chopped it with scissors 
same ones you use for everything. Your sweater has holes. 
When you feed the ram lambs, you say goodbye. 
Summer, choke cherries; your mouth’s dry. Apples, cider. 
Corn picking. Canning for weeks that feel like years. 
Chopping heads off quail, rabbits, chickens. 
You can pluck a chicken, gut it fast. 
You find unformed eggs, unformed chicks. 
They start chirping day nineteen. 
You make biscuits and gravy for hundred kids 
serve them up good. You’re the chick 
who never got past day nineteen, never found your chick voice. 
You make iced tea. They say, you’re a soldier in the king’s army. 
At night, you say to yourself, Kathy, someday. 
We go walking. We go talking. We find a big story. 
A cracking egg story. A walking girl story. 
A walking out of the woods story. A not slapped silly story. 
A not Jesus story. Hush, Kathy you say, we get out of here. 
We find out where chicks go when they learn to fly.","I come from hay and barns, raising chickens. In spring, lambs come. In summer, choke cherries; your mouth’s dry. Canning for weeks that feel like years."
[since feeling is first],"since feeling is first
who pays any attention 
to the syntax of things
will never wholly kiss you;
wholly to be a fool
while Spring is in the world
my blood approves,
and kisses are a better fate 
than wisdom

your eyelids’ flutter which says

Poem,"(To F. S.)
I loved my friend. 
He went away from me. 
There’s nothing more to say. 
The poem ends, 
Soft as it began,—
I loved my friend. ","I loved my friend. He went away from me. There’s nothing more to say. (To F. S.) The poem ends,                 Soft as it began."
Macavity: The Mystery Cat,"Macavity’s a Mystery Cat: he’s called the Hidden Paw—
For he’s the master criminal who can defy the Law.
He’s the bafflement of Scotland Yard, the Flying Squad’s despair:
For when they reach the scene of crime—Macavity’s not there!
Macavity, Macavity, there’s no one like Macavity,
He’s broken every human law, he breaks the law of gravity.
His powers of levitation would make a fakir stare,
And when you reach the scene of crime—Macavity’s not there!
You may seek him in the basement, you may look up in the air—
But I tell you once and once again, Macavity’s not there!
Macavity’s a ginger cat, he’s very tall and thin;
You would know him if you saw him, for his eyes are sunken in.
His brow is deeply lined with thought, his head is highly domed;
His coat is dusty from neglect, his whiskers are uncombed.
He sways his head from side to side, with movements like a snake;
And when you think he’s half asleep, he’s always wide awake.
Macavity, Macavity, there’s no one like Macavity,
For he’s a fiend in feline shape, a monster of depravity.
You may meet him in a by-street, you may see him in the square—
But when a crime’s discovered, then Macavity’s not there!
He’s outwardly respectable. (They say he cheats at cards.)
And his footprints are not found in any file of Scotland Yard’s.
And when the larder’s looted, or the jewel-case is rifled,
Or when the milk is missing, or another Peke’s been stifled,
Or the greenhouse glass is broken, and the trellis past repair—
Ay, there’s the wonder of the thing! Macavity’s not there!
And when the Foreign Office find a Treaty’s gone astray,
Or the Admiralty lose some plans and drawings by the way,
There may be a scrap of paper in the hall or on the stair—
But it’s useless to investigate—Macavity’s not there!
And when the loss has been disclosed, the Secret Service say:
‘It must have been Macavity!’—but he’s a mile away.
You’ll be sure to find him resting, or a-licking of his thumbs;
Or engaged in doing complicated long division sums.
Macavity, Macavity, there’s no one like Macavity,
There never was a Cat of such deceitfulness and suavity.
He always has an alibi, and one or two to spare:
At whatever time the deed took place—MACAVITY WASN’T THERE!
And they say that all the Cats whose wicked deeds are widely known
(I might mention Mungojerrie, I might mention Griddlebone)
Are nothing more than agents for the Cat who all the time
Just controls their operations: the Napoleon of Crime!","Macavity is the master criminal who can defy the Law. He’s broken every human law, he breaks the law of gravity. His powers of levitation would make a fakir stare. He always has an alibi, and one or two."
"Song of Myself, 51","The past and present wilt—I have fill'd them, emptied them.
And proceed to fill my next fold of the future.
Listener up there! what have you to confide to me?
Look in my face while I snuff the sidle of evening,
(Talk honestly, no one else hears you, and I stay only a minute longer.)
Do I contradict myself?
Very well then I contradict myself,
(I am large, I contain multitudes.)
I concentrate toward them that are nigh, I wait on the door-slab.
Who has done his day's work? who will soonest be through with his supper?
Who wishes to walk with me?
Will you speak before I am gone? will you prove already too late?","The writer asks: ""What have you to confide to me?"" He then asks the listener: ""Will you speak before I am gone?"""
On Friendship,"And a youth said, Speak to us of Friendship.
    And he answered, saying:
    Your friend is your needs answered.
    He is your field which you sow with love and reap with thanksgiving.
    And he is your board and your fireside.
    For you come to him with your hunger, and you seek him for peace.
    When your friend speaks his mind you fear not the “nay” in your own mind, nor do you withhold the “ay.”
    And when he is silent your heart ceases not to listen to his heart;
    For without words, in friendship, all thoughts, all desires, all expectations are born and shared, with joy that is unacclaimed.
    When you part from your friend, you grieve not;
    For that which you love most in him may be clearer in his absence, as the mountain to the climber is clearer from the plain.
    And let there be no purpose in friendship save the deepening of the spirit.
    For love that seeks aught but the disclosure of its own mystery us not love but a net cast forth: and only the unprofitable is caught.
    And let your best be for your friend.
    If he must know the ebb of your tide, let him know its flood also.
    For what is your friend that you should seek him with hours to kill?
    Seek him always with hours to live.
    For it is his to fill your need but not your emptiness.
    And in the sweetness of friendship let there be laughter, and sharing of pleasures.
    For in the dew of little things the heart finds its morning and is refreshed.","In friendship, all thoughts, all desires, all expectations are born and shared, with joy that is unacclaimed. When you part from your friend, you grieve not; that which you love most in him may be clearer in his absence."
Wind and Window Flower,"Lovers, forget your love,
     And list to the love of these,
She a window flower,
     And he a winter breeze.

When the frosty window veil
     Was melted down at noon,
And the cagèd yellow bird
     Hung over her in tune,

He marked her through the pane,
     He could not help but mark,
And only passed her by,
     To come again at dark.

He was a winter wind,
     Concerned with ice and snow,
Dead weeds and unmated birds,
     And little of love could know.

But he sighed upon the sill,
     He gave the sash a shake,
As witness all within
     Who lay that night awake.

Perchance he half prevailed
     To win her for the flight
From the firelit looking-glass
     And warm stove-window light.

But the flower leaned aside
     And thought of naught to say,
And morning found the breeze
     A hundred miles away.","She was a window flower, and he was a winter breeze. Lovers, forget your love, and list to the love of these."
My November Guest,"My sorrow, when she’s here with me,
     Thinks these dark days of autumn rain
Are beautiful as days can be;
She loves the bare, the withered tree;
     She walks the sodden pasture lane.
Her pleasure will not let me stay.
     She talks and I am fain to list:
She’s glad the birds are gone away,
She’s glad her simple worsted grey
     Is silver now with clinging mist.
The desolate, deserted trees,
     The faded earth, the heavy sky,
The beauties she so truly sees,
She thinks I have no eye for these,
     And vexes me for reason why.
Not yesterday I learned to know
     The love of bare November days
Before the coming of the snow,
But it were vain to tell her so,
     And they are better for her praise.","My sorrow, when she’s here with me, thinks these dark days of autumn rain are beautiful as days can be. She loves the bare, the withered tree; she walks the sodden pasture lane. Her pleasure will not let me stay."
Kissing in Vietnamese,"My grandmother kisses
as if bombs are bursting in the backyard,
where mint and jasmine lace their perfumes
through the kitchen window,
as if somewhere, a body is falling apart
and flames are making their way back
through the intricacies of a young boy’s thigh,
as if to walk out the door, your torso
would dance from exit wounds.
When my grandmother kisses, there would be
no flashy smooching, no western music
of pursed lips, she kisses as if to breathe
you inside her, nose pressed to cheek
so that your scent is relearned
and your sweat pearls into drops of gold
inside her lungs, as if while she holds you
death also, is clutching your wrist.
My grandmother kisses as if history
never ended, as if somewhere
a body is still
falling apart.","When my grandmother kisses, there would be no flashy smooching, no western music. She kisses as if to breathe you inside her, nose pressed to cheek, sweat pearls into drops of gold."
Perhaps the World Ends Here,"The world begins at a kitchen table. No matter what, we must eat to live.
The gifts of earth are brought and prepared, set on the table. So it has been since creation, and it will go on.
We chase chickens or dogs away from it. Babies teethe at the corners. They scrape their knees under it.
It is here that children are given instructions on what it means to be human. We make men at it, we make women.
At this table we gossip, recall enemies and the ghosts of lovers.
Our dreams drink coffee with us as they put their arms around our children. They laugh with us at our poor falling-down selves and as we put ourselves back together once again at the table.
This table has been a house in the rain, an umbrella in the sun.
Wars have begun and ended at this table. It is a place to hide in the shadow of terror. A place to celebrate the terrible victory.
We have given birth on this table, and have prepared our parents for burial here.
At this table we sing with joy, with sorrow. We pray of suffering and remorse. We give thanks.
Perhaps the world will end at the kitchen table, while we are laughing and crying, eating of the last sweet bite.","The world begins at a kitchen table. No matter what, we must eat to live. The gifts of earth are brought and prepared, set on the table. So it has been since creation, and it will go on."
The Conditional,"Say tomorrow doesn’t come.

Say the shirt’s plastic ditch-litter.
Say the kitchen’s a cow’s corpse.

Say we spend our last moments staring
at each other, hands knotted together,

Silence,"My father used to say,
""Superior people never make long visits,
have to be shown Longfellow's grave
or the glass flowers at Harvard.
Self-reliant like the cat—
that takes its prey to privacy,
the mouse's limp tail hanging like a shoelace from its mouth—
they sometimes enjoy solitude,
and can be robbed of speech
by speech which has delighted them.
The deepest feeling always shows itself in silence;
not in silence, but restraint.""
Nor was he insincere in saying, ""Make my house your inn.""
Inns are not residences.","Superior people never make long visits to Longfellow's grave or the glass flowers at Harvard. The deepest feeling always shows itself in silence; not in silence, but restraint."
Having a Coke with You,"is even more fun than going to San Sebastian, Irún, Hendaye, Biarritz, Bayonne
or being sick to my stomach on the Travesera de Gracia in Barcelona
partly because in your orange shirt you look like a better happier St. Sebastian
partly because of my love for you, partly because of your love for yoghurt
partly because of the fluorescent orange tulips around the birches
partly because of the secrecy our smiles take on before people and statuary
it is hard to believe when I’m with you that there can be anything as still
as solemn as unpleasantly definitive as statuary when right in front of it
in the warm New York 4 o’clock light we are drifting back and forth
between each other like a tree breathing through its spectacles
and the portrait show seems to have no faces in it at all, just paint
you suddenly wonder why in the world anyone ever did them
                                                                                                              I look
at you and I would rather look at you than all the portraits in the world
except possibly for the Polish Rider occasionally and anyway it’s in the Frick
which thank heavens you haven’t gone to yet so we can go together for the first time
and the fact that you move so beautifully more or less takes care of Futurism
just as at home I never think of the Nude Descending a Staircase or
at a rehearsal a single drawing of Leonardo or Michelangelo that used to wow me
and what good does all the research of the Impressionists do them
when they never got the right person to stand near the tree when the sun sank
or for that matter Marino Marini when he didn’t pick the rider as carefully
as the horse
                               it seems they were all cheated of some marvelous experience
which is not going to go wasted on me which is why I’m telling you about it","""I would rather look at you than all the portraits in the world"" ""I never think of the Nude Descending a Staircase or Leonardo"" ""It seems they were all cheated of some marvelous experience"""
The Change,"The season turned like the page of a glossy fashion magazine. 
In the park the daffodils came up 
and in the parking lot, the new car models were on parade.

Sometimes I think that nothing really changes—

The young girls show the latest crop of tummies, 
        and the new president proves that he's a dummy.

But remember the tennis match we watched that year? 
Right before our eyes

some tough little European blonde 
pitted against that big black girl from Alabama, 
cornrowed hair and Zulu bangles on her arms, 
some outrageous name like Vondella Aphrodite—

We were just walking past the lounge 
     and got sucked in by the screen above the bar, 
and pretty soon 
we started to care about who won,

putting ourselves into each whacked return 
as the volleys went back and forth and back 
like some contest between 
the old world and the new,

and you loved her complicated hair 
and her to-hell-with-everybody stare, 
and I, 
         I couldn't help wanting
the white girl to come out on top, 
because she was one of my kind, my tribe, 
with her pale eyes and thin lips

and because the black girl was so big 
and so black, 
                        so unintimidated,

hitting the ball like she was driving the Emancipation Proclamation 
down Abraham Lincoln's throat, 
like she wasn't asking anyone's permission.

There are moments when history 
passes you so close 
                you can smell its breath, 
you can reach your hand out 
                                    and touch it on its flank,

and I don't watch all that much Masterpiece Theatre, 
but I could feel the end of an era there

in front of those bleachers full of people 
in their Sunday tennis-watching clothes

as that black girl wore down her opponent 
then kicked her ass good 
then thumped her once more for good measure

and stood up on the red clay court 
holding her racket over her head like a guitar.

And the little pink judge 
                          had to climb up on a box 
to put the ribbon on her neck, 
still managing to smile into the camera flash, 
even though everything was changing

and in fact, everything had already changed—

Poof, remember? It was the twentieth century almost gone, 
we were there,

and when we went to put it back where it belonged, 
it was past us 
and we were changed.
  Listen to Claudia Rankine respond to Hoagland's poem >",The poem was written by Claudia Rankine for the BBC's Radio 4 Today programme. Rankine was inspired by a tennis match between a white girl and a black girl. Hoagland says he could feel the end of an era as he watched the match.
Antigonish [I met a man who wasn't there],"Yesterday, upon the stair,
I met a man who wasn't there
He wasn't there again today
I wish, I wish he'd go away...
When I came home last night at three
The man was waiting there for me
But when I looked around the hall
I couldn't see him there at all!
Go away, go away, don't you come back any more!
Go away, go away, and please don't slam the door... (slam!)
Last night I saw upon the stair
A little man who wasn't there
He wasn't there again today
Oh, how I wish he'd go away...","""I wish, I wish he'd go away... (slam!) "" is a poem written by a young woman about a man she met on the stair. ""Go away, go away, don't you come back any more!"" is a song about a missing man."

Sharks in the Rivers,"We'll say unbelievable things 
to each other in the early morning— 
  
our blue coming up from our roots, 
our water rising in our extraordinary limbs. 
  
All night I dreamt of bonfires and burn piles 
and ghosts of men, and spirits 
behind those birds of flame. 
  
I cannot tell anymore when a door opens or closes, 
I can only hear the frame saying, Walk through. 
  
It is a short walkway— 
into another bedroom. 
  
Consider the handle. Consider the key. 
  
I say to a friend, how scared I am of sharks. 
  
How I thought I saw them in the creek 
across from my street. 
  
I once watched for them, holding a bundle 
of rattlesnake grass in my hand, 
shaking like a weak-leaf girl. 
  
She sends me an article from a recent National Geographic that says, 
  
Sharks bite fewer people each year than 
New Yorkers do, according to Health Department records. 
  
Then she sends me on my way. Into the City of Sharks. 
  
Through another doorway, I walk to the East River saying, 
  
Sharks are people too. 
Sharks are people too. 
Sharks are people too. 
  
I write all the things I need on the bottom 
of my tennis shoes. I say, Let's walk together. 
  
The sun behind me is like a fire. 
Tiny flames in the river's ripples. 
  
I say something to God, but he's not a living thing, 
so I say it to the river, I say, 
  
I want to walk through this doorway 
But without all those ghosts on the edge, 
I want them to stay here. 
I want them to go on without me. 
  
I want them to burn in the water.","The book is called ""The City of Sharks"" and is published by Simon & Schuster. The book is published in hardback and is available on Kindle."
"Romeo and Juliet, Act III, Scene II [Gallop apace, you fiery-footed steeds]","Juliet waits for nightfall when Romeo will return.

Juliet: Gallop apace, you fiery-footed steeds,
Towards Phoebus' lodging: such a waggoner
As Phaethon would whip you to the west,
And bring in cloudy night immediately.
Spread thy close curtain, love-performing night,
That runaway's eyes may wink and Romeo
Leap to these arms, untalk'd of and unseen.
Lovers can see to do their amorous rites
By their own beauties; or, if love be blind,
It best agrees with night. Come, civil night,
Thou sober-suited matron, all in black,
And learn me how to lose a winning match,
Play'd for a pair of stainless maidenhoods.
Hood my unmann'd blood bating in my cheeks
With thy black mantle, till strange love grown bold
Think true love acted simple modesty.
Come, night, come, Romeo, come, thou day in night;
For thou wilt lie upon the wings of night
Whiter than new snow on a raven's back.
Come, gentle night, come, loving, black-brow'd night,
Give me my Romeo; and, when he shall die,
Take him and cut him out in little stars,
And he will make the face of heaven so fine
That all the world will be in love with night
And pay no worship to the garish sun.
O, I have bought the mansion of a love,
But not possess'd it, and, though I am sold,
Not yet enjoy'd: so tedious is this day
As is the night before some festival
To an impatient child that hath new robes
And may not wear them. O, here comes my nurse,
And she brings news, and every tongue that speaks
But Romeo's name speaks heavenly eloquence.","Juliet waits for nightfall when Romeo will return to her. Romeo's name speaks heavenly eloquence, says the poet. Juliet is a sober-suited matron, all in black, says Shakespeare."
The Fish,"wade
through black jade.
       Of the crow-blue mussel-shells, one keeps
       adjusting the ash-heaps;
              opening and shutting itself like
an
injured fan.
       The barnacles which encrust the side
       of the wave, cannot hide
              there for the submerged shafts of the
sun,
split like spun
       glass, move themselves with spotlight swiftness
       into the crevices—
              in and out, illuminating
the

Dream-Land,"By a route obscure and lonely,
Haunted by ill angels only,
Where an Eidolon, named NIGHT,
On a black throne reigns upright,
I have reached these lands but newly
From an ultimate dim Thule—
From a wild clime that lieth, sublime,
            Out of SPACE— out of TIME.

Bottomless vales and boundless floods,
And chasms, and caves, and Titan woods,
With forms that no man can discover
For the tears that drip all over;
Mountains toppling evermore
Into seas without a shore;
Seas that restlessly aspire,
Surging, unto skies of fire;
Lakes that endlessly outspread
Their lone waters— lone and dead,—
Their still waters— still and chilly
With the snows of the lolling lily.

By the lakes that thus outspread
Their lone waters, lone and dead,—
Their sad waters, sad and chilly
With the snows of the lolling lily,—
By the mountains— near the river
Murmuring lowly, murmuring ever,—
By the grey woods,— by the swamp
Where the toad and the newt encamp—
By the dismal tarns and pools


     Where dwell the Ghouls,—
By each spot the most unholy—
In each nook most melancholy—
There the traveller meets aghast
Sheeted Memories of the Past—
Shrouded forms that start and sigh
As they pass the wanderer by—
White—robed forms of friends long given,
In agony, to the Earth— and Heaven.

For the heart whose woes are legion
'Tis a peaceful, soothing region—
For the spirit that walks in shadow
'Tis— oh, 'tis an Eldorado!
But the traveller, travelling through it,
May not— dare not openly view it!
Never its mysteries are exposed
To the weak human eye unclosed;
So wills its King, who hath forbid
The uplifting of the fringed lid;
And thus the sad Soul that here passes
Beholds it but through darkened glasses.

By a route obscure and lonely,
Haunted by ill angels only,
Where an Eidolon, named NIGHT,
On a black throne reigns upright,
I have wandered home but newly
From this ultimate dim Thule.","From a wild clime that lieth, sublime, out of SPACE— out of TIME. By a route obscure and lonely,Haunted by ill angels only. An Eidolon, named NIGHT, on a black throne reigns upright."
Childe Harold's Pilgrimage [There is a pleasure in the pathless woods],"   There is a pleasure in the pathless woods,
   There is a rapture on the lonely shore,
   There is society where none intrudes,
   By the deep Sea, and music in its roar:
   I love not Man the less, but Nature more,
   From these our interviews, in which I steal
   From all I may be, or have been before,
   To mingle with the Universe, and feel
What I can ne'er express, yet cannot all conceal.
   Roll on, thou deep and dark blue Ocean--roll!
   Ten thousand fleets sweep over thee in vain;
   Man marks the earth with ruin--his control
   Stops with the shore;--upon the watery plain
   The wrecks are all thy deed, nor doth remain
   A shadow of man's ravage, save his own,
   When for a moment, like a drop of rain,
   He sinks into thy depths with bubbling groan,
Without a grave, unknelled, uncoffined, and unknown.
   His steps are not upon thy paths,--thy fields
   Are not a spoil for him,--thou dost arise
   And shake him from thee; the vile strength he wields
   For earth's destruction thou dost all despise,
   Spurning him from thy bosom to the skies,
   And send'st him, shivering in thy playful spray
   And howling, to his gods, where haply lies
   His petty hope in some near port or bay,
And dashest him again to earth: —there let him lay.","""I love not Man the less, but Nature more,"" he writes. ""There is a pleasure in the pathless woods, and a rapture on the lonely shore"""
Such Is the Sickness of Many a Good Thing,"Was he then Adam of the Burning Way? 
hid away in the heat like wrath 
        conceald in Love’s face, 
or the seed, Eris in Eros, 
        key and lock 
of what I was?        I could not speak 
        the releasing 
word.        For into a dark 
        matter he came 
and askt me to say what 
        I could not say.        ""I .."" 


All the flame in me stopt 
        against my tongue. 
My heart was a stone, a dumb 
        unmanageable thing in me, 
a darkness that stood athwart 
        his need 
for the enlightening, the 
        ""I love you"" that has 
only this one quick in time, 
        this one start 
when its moment is true. 


Such is the sickness of many a good thing 
that now into my life from long ago this 
refusing to say I love you has bound 
the weeping, the yielding, the 
        yearning to be taken again, 
into a knot, a waiting, a string 


so taut it taunts the song, 
it resists the touch. It grows dark 
to draw down the lover’s hand 
from its lightness to what’s 
        underground.","""I could not speak"" ""I love you"" was the only word that came out of my mouth. ""My heart was a stone, a dumb  unmanageable thing in me"""
The Charge of the Light Brigade,"Half a league, half a league,

Her Kind,"I have gone out, a possessed witch,
haunting the black air, braver at night;
dreaming evil, I have done my hitch
over the plain houses, light by light:
lonely thing, twelve-fingered, out of mind.
A woman like that is not a woman, quite.
I have been her kind.
I have found the warm caves in the woods,
filled them with skillets, carvings, shelves,
closets, silks, innumerable goods;
fixed the suppers for the worms and the elves:
whining, rearranging the disaligned.
A woman like that is misunderstood.
I have been her kind.
I have ridden in your cart, driver,
waved my nude arms at villages going by,
learning the last bright routes, survivor
where your flames still bite my thigh
and my ribs crack where your wheels wind.

Because I could not stop for Death (479),"Because I could not stop for Death—
He kindly stopped for me—
The Carriage held but just Ourselves— 
And Immortality.
We slowly drove—He knew no haste
And I had put away
My labor and my leisure too,
For His Civility—
We passed the School, where Children strove
At Recess—in the Ring—
We passed the Fields of Gazing Grain—
We passed the Setting Sun—
Or rather—He passed us—
The Dews drew quivering and chill—
For only Gossamer, my Gown—
My Tippet—only Tulle—
We paused before a House that seemed
A Swelling of the Ground—
The Roof was scarcely visible—
The Cornice—in the Ground—
Since then—’tis Centuries—and yet
Feels shorter than the Day
I first surmised the Horses’ Heads
Were toward Eternity—","Because I could not stop for Death, he kindly stopped for me. The Carriage held but just Ourselves—                 And Immortality. The Roof was scarcely visible. The Cornice—in the Ground."
Ode to the West Wind,"  I
  O wild West Wind, thou breath of Autumn’s being,
Thou, from whose unseen presence the leaves dead
Are driven, like ghosts from an enchanter fleeing,
  Yellow, and black, and pale, and hectic red,
Pestilence-stricken multitudes: O thou,
Who chariotest to their dark wintry bed
The wingèd seeds, where they lie cold and low,
Each like a corpse within its grave, until
Thine azure sister of the Spring shall blow
Her clarion o’er the dreaming earth, and fill
(Driving sweet buds like flocks to feed in air)
With living hues and odours plain and hill:
Wild Spirit, which art moving everywhere;
Destroyer and Preserver; hear, O hear!
  II
  Thou on whose stream, ‘mid the steep sky’s commotion,
Loose clouds like Earth’s decaying leaves are shed,
Shook from the tangled boughs of Heaven and Ocean,
  Angels of rain and lightning: there are spread
On the blue surface of thine airy surge,
Like the bright hair uplifted from the head
Of some fierce Maenad, even from the dim verge
Of the horizon to the zenith’s height,
The locks of the approaching storm. Thou dirge
Of the dying year, to which this closing night
Will be the dome of a vast sepulchre
Vaulted with all thy congregated might
Of vapours, from whose solid atmosphere
Black rain, and fire, and hail will burst: O hear!
  III
  Thou who didst waken from his summer dreams
The blue Mediterranean, where he lay,
Lulled by the coil of his crystalline streams,
  Beside a pumice isle in Baiae’s bay,
And saw in sleep old palaces and towers
Quivering within the wave's intenser day,
All overgrown with azure moss and flowers
So sweet, the sense faints picturing them! Thou
For whose path the Atlantic’s level powers
Cleave themselves into chasms, while far below
The sea-blooms and the oozy woods which wear
The sapless foliage of the ocean, know
Thy voice, and suddenly grow grey with fear,
And tremble and despoil themselves: O hear!
  IV
  If I were a dead leaf thou mightest bear;
If I were a swift cloud to fly with thee;
A wave to pant beneath thy power, and share
  The impulse of thy strength, only less free
Than thou, O Uncontrollable! If even
I were as in my boyhood, and could be
The comrade of thy wanderings over Heaven,
As then, when to outstrip thy skiey speed
Scarce seemed a vision; I would ne’er have striven
As thus with thee in prayer in my sore need.
Oh! lift me as a wave, a leaf, a cloud!
I fall upon the thorns of life! I bleed!
A heavy weight of hours has chained and bowed
One too like thee: tameless, and swift, and proud.
  V
  Make me thy lyre, even as the forest is:
What if my leaves are falling like its own!
The tumult of thy mighty harmonies
  Will take from both a deep, autumnal tone,
Sweet though in sadness. Be thou, Spirit fierce,
My spirit! Be thou me, impetuous one!
Drive my dead thoughts over the universe
Like withered leaves to quicken a new birth!
And, by the incantation of this verse,
Scatter, as from an unextinguished hearth
Ashes and sparks, my words among mankind!
Be through my lips to unawakened Earth
The trumpet of a prophecy! O Wind,
If Winter comes, can Spring be far behind?","O wild West Wind, thou breath of Autumn’s being. O thou, from whose unseen presence the leaves dead are driven, like ghosts from an enchanter fleeing. Yellow, and black, and pale, and hectic red, plague the world."
Wanting to Die,"Since you ask, most days I cannot remember.
I walk in my clothing, unmarked by that voyage.
Then the almost unnameable lust returns.
Even then I have nothing against life.
I know well the grass blades you mention,
the furniture you have placed under the sun.
But suicides have a special language.
Like carpenters they want to know which tools.
They never ask why build.
Twice I have so simply declared myself,
have possessed the enemy, eaten the enemy,
have taken on his craft, his magic.
In this way, heavy and thoughtful,
warmer than oil or water,
I have rested, drooling at the mouth-hole.
I did not think of my body at needle point.
Even the cornea and the leftover urine were gone.
Suicides have already betrayed the body.
Still-born, they don't always die,
but dazzled, they can't forget a drug so sweet
that even children would look on and smile.
To thrust all that life under your tongue!--
that, all by itself, becomes a passion.
Death's a sad Bone; bruised, you'd say,
and yet she waits for me, year after year,
to so delicately undo an old wound,
to empty my breath from its bad prison.
Balanced there, suicides sometimes meet,
raging at the fruit, a pumped-up moon,
leaving the bread they mistook for a kiss,
leaving the page of the book carelessly open,
something unsaid, the phone off the hook
and the love, whatever it was, an infection.","Suicides have a special language. Since you ask, most days most days I cannot remember. Then the almost unnameable lust returns. Even the cornea and the leftover urine were gone."
How Do I Love Thee? (Sonnet 43),"How do I love thee? Let me count the ways.
I love thee to the depth and breadth and height
My soul can reach, when feeling out of sight
For the ends of being and ideal grace.
I love thee to the level of every day’s
Most quiet need, by sun and candle-light.
I love thee freely, as men strive for right.
I love thee purely, as they turn from praise.
I love thee with the passion put to use
In my old griefs, and with my childhood’s faith.
I love thee with a love I seemed to lose
With my lost saints. I love thee with the breath,
Smiles, tears, of all my life; and, if God choose,
I shall but love thee better after death.","I love thee to the level of every day’s quiet need, by sun and candle-light. I love thee with the passion put to use in my old griefs, and with my childhood's faith. And, if God choose, I shall but love thee better after death."
Casey at the Bat,"The outlook wasn't brilliant for the Mudville nine that day:
The score stood four to two, with but one inning more to play,
And then when Cooney died at first, and Barrows did the same,
A pall-like silence fell upon the patrons of the game.
A straggling few got up to go in deep despair. The rest
Clung to the hope which springs eternal in the human breast;
They thought, ""If only Casey could but get a whack at that—
We'd put up even money now, with Casey at the bat.""
But Flynn preceded Casey, as did also Jimmy Blake,
And the former was a hoodoo, while the latter was a cake;
So upon that stricken multitude grim melancholy sat,
For there seemed but little chance of Casey getting to the bat.
But Flynn let drive a single, to the wonderment of all,
And Blake, the much despisèd, tore the cover off the ball;
And when the dust had lifted, and men saw what had occurred,
There was Jimmy safe at second and Flynn a-hugging third.
Then from five thousand throats and more there rose a lusty yell;
It rumbled through the valley, it rattled in the dell;
It pounded on the mountain and recoiled upon the flat,
For Casey, mighty Casey, was advancing to the bat.
There was ease in Casey's manner as he stepped into his place;
There was pride in Casey's bearing and a smile lit Casey's face.
And when, responding to the cheers, he lightly doffed his hat,
No stranger in the crowd could doubt 'twas Casey at the bat.
Ten thousand eyes were on him as he rubbed his hands with dirt;
Five thousand tongues applauded when he wiped them on his shirt;
Then while the writhing pitcher ground the ball into his hip,
Defiance flashed in Casey's eye, a sneer curled Casey's lip.
And now the leather-covered sphere came hurtling through the air,
And Casey stood a-watching it in haughty grandeur there.
Close by the sturdy batsman the ball unheeded sped—
""That ain't my style,"" said Casey. ""Strike one!"" the umpire said.
From the benches, black with people, there went up a muffled roar,
Like the beating of the storm-waves on a stern and distant shore;
""Kill him! Kill the umpire!"" shouted someone on the stand;
And it's likely they'd have killed him had not Casey raised his hand.
With a smile of Christian charity great Casey's visage shone;
He stilled the rising tumult; he bade the game go on;
He signaled to the pitcher, and once more the dun sphere flew;
But Casey still ignored it and the umpire said, ""Strike two!""
""Fraud!"" cried the maddened thousands, and echo answered ""Fraud!""
But one scornful look from Casey and the audience was awed.
They saw his face grow stern and cold, they saw his muscles strain,
And they knew that Casey wouldn't let that ball go by again.
The sneer is gone from Casey's lip, his teeth are clenched in hate,
He pounds with cruel violence his bat upon the plate;
And now the pitcher holds the ball, and now he lets it go,
And now the air is shattered by the force of Casey's blow.
Oh, somewhere in this favoured land the sun is shining bright,
The band is playing somewhere, and somewhere hearts are light;
And somewhere men are laughing, and somewhere children shout,
But there is no joy in Mudville—mighty Casey has struck out.","The Mudville nine were down four to two with one inning to play when Cooney and Barrows died. Casey, the mighty batsman, was advancing to the bat. The umpire said, ""Strike one!"" and Casey ignored it. The crowd roared, and Casey raised his hand and struck out."
As I Walked Out One Evening,"As I walked out one evening,
   Walking down Bristol Street,
The crowds upon the pavement
   Were fields of harvest wheat.
And down by the brimming river
   I heard a lover sing
Under an arch of the railway:
   ‘Love has no ending.
‘I’ll love you, dear, I’ll love you
   Till China and Africa meet,
And the river jumps over the mountain
   And the salmon sing in the street,
‘I’ll love you till the ocean
   Is folded and hung up to dry
And the seven stars go squawking
   Like geese about the sky.
‘The years shall run like rabbits,
   For in my arms I hold
The Flower of the Ages,
   And the first love of the world.’
But all the clocks in the city
   Began to whirr and chime:
‘O let not Time deceive you,
   You cannot conquer Time.
‘In the burrows of the Nightmare
   Where Justice naked is,
Time watches from the shadow
   And coughs when you would kiss.
‘In headaches and in worry
   Vaguely life leaks away,
And Time will have his fancy
   To-morrow or to-day.
‘Into many a green valley
   Drifts the appalling snow;
Time breaks the threaded dances
   And the diver’s brilliant bow.
‘O plunge your hands in water,
   Plunge them in up to the wrist;
Stare, stare in the basin
   And wonder what you’ve missed.
‘The glacier knocks in the cupboard,
   The desert sighs in the bed,
And the crack in the tea-cup opens
   A lane to the land of the dead.
‘Where the beggars raffle the banknotes
   And the Giant is enchanting to Jack,
And the Lily-white Boy is a Roarer,
   And Jill goes down on her back.
‘O look, look in the mirror,
   O look in your distress:
Life remains a blessing
   Although you cannot bless.
‘O stand, stand at the window
   As the tears scald and start;
You shall love your crooked neighbour
   With your crooked heart.’
It was late, late in the evening,
   The lovers they were gone;
The clocks had ceased their chiming,
   And the deep river ran on.",'Love has no ending' is one of the most famous poems of the 20th century. The poem was written by British poet David Walliams. It was written in response to a poem by the same name written in the same year.
On the Circuit,"Among pelagian travelers,
Lost on their lewd conceited way
To Massachusetts, Michigan,
Miami or L.A.,

An airborne instrument I sit,
Predestined nightly to fulfill
Columbia-Giesen-Management's
Unfathomable will,

By whose election justified,
I bring my gospel of the Muse
To fundamentalists, to nuns,
to Gentiles and to Jews,

And daily, seven days a week,
Before a local sense has jelled,
From talking-site to talking-site
Am jet-or-prop-propelled.

Though warm my welcome everywhere,
I shift so frequently, so fast,
I cannot now say where I was 
The evening before last,

Unless some singular event
Should intervene to save the place,
A truly asinine remark,
A soul-bewitching face,

Or blessed encounter, full of joy,
Unscheduled on the Giesen Plan,
With, here, an addict of Tolkien,
There, a Charles Williams fan.

Since Merit but a dunghill is,
I mount the rostrum unafraid:
Indeed, 'twere damnable to ask
If I am overpaid.

Spirit is willing to repeat
Without a qualm the same old talk,
But Flesh is homesick for our snug
Apartment in New York.

A sulky fifty-six, he finds
A change of mealtime utter hell,
Grown far too crotchety to like
A luxury hotel.

The Bible is a goodly book
I always can peruse with zest,
But really cannot say the same
For Hilton's Be My Guest.

Nor bear with equanimity
The radio in students' cars,
Muzak at breakfast, or--dear God!--
Girl-organists in bars.

Then, worst of all, the anxious thought,
Each time my plane begins to sink
And the No Smoking sign comes on:
What will there be to drink?

Is this a milieu where I must
How grahamgreeneish!  How infra dig!
Snatch from the bottle in my bag 
An analeptic swig?

Another morning comes: I see,
Dwindling below me on the plane,
The roofs of one more audience
I shall not see again.

God bless the lot of them, although
I don't remember which was which:
God bless the U.S.A., so large,
So friendly, and so rich.","The author travels the U.S. with his gospel of the Muse. He delivers it daily, seven days a week, to all walks of life."

Extract Vermouth from the bergamot, even the rain.
How did the Enemy love you—with earth? air? and fire?
He held just one thing back till he got even: the rain.
This is God’s site for a new house of executions?
You swear by the Bible, Despot, even the rain?
After the bones—those flowers—this was found in the urn:
The lost river, ashes from the ghat, even the rain.
What was I to prophesy if not the end of the world?
A salt pillar for the lonely lot, even the rain.
How the air raged, desperate, streaming the earth with flames—
To help burn down my house, Fire sought even the rain.
He would raze the mountains, he would level the waves;
he would, to smooth his epic plot, even the rain.

Lift Every Voice and Sing,"Lift every voice and sing,
Till earth and heaven ring,
Ring with the harmonies of Liberty;
Let our rejoicing rise
High as the list'ning skies,
Let it resound loud as the rolling sea.
Sing a song full of the faith that the dark past has taught us,
Sing a song full of the hope that the present has brought us;
Facing the rising sun of our new day begun,
Let us march on till victory is won.
Stony the road we trod,
Bitter the chast'ning rod,
Felt in the days when hope unborn had died;
Yet with a steady beat,
Have not our weary feet
Come to the place for which our fathers sighed?
We have come over a way that with tears has been watered.
We have come, treading our path through the blood of the slaughtered,
Out from the gloomy past,
Till now we stand at last
Where the white gleam of our bright star is cast.
God of our weary years,
God of our silent tears,
Thou who hast brought us thus far on the way;
Thou who hast by Thy might,
Led us into the light,
Keep us forever in the path, we pray.
Lest our feet stray from the places, our God, where we met Thee,
Lest our hearts, drunk with the wine of the world, we forget Thee;
Shadowed beneath Thy hand,
May we forever stand,
True to our God,
True to our native land.","Lyrics: ""Sing a song full of the faith that the dark past has taught us"" ""Let our rejoicing rise high as the list'ning skies, let it resound loud as the rolling sea"" ""We have come over a way that with tears has been watered"""
The Second Coming,"Turning and turning in the widening gyre
The falcon cannot hear the falconer;
Things fall apart; the centre cannot hold;
Mere anarchy is loosed upon the world,
The blood-dimmed tide is loosed, and everywhere
The ceremony of innocence is drowned;
The best lack all conviction, while the worst
Are full of passionate intensity.
Surely some revelation is at hand;
Surely the Second Coming is at hand.
The Second Coming! Hardly are those words out
When a vast image out of Spiritus Mundi
Troubles my sight: somewhere in sands of the desert
A shape with lion body and the head of a man,
A gaze blank and pitiless as the sun,
Is moving its slow thighs, while all about it
Reel shadows of the indignant desert birds.
The darkness drops again; but now I know
That twenty centuries of stony sleep
Were vexed to nightmare by a rocking cradle,
And what rough beast, its hour come round at last,
Slouches towards Bethlehem to be born?","The Second Coming is at hand, says the author, as a vast image emerges from the sands of the desert. The image is of a lion body and the head of a man, with a gaze blank and pitiless as the sun."
Stanzas,"Often rebuked, yet always back returning
    To those first feelings that were born with me,
And leaving busy chase of wealth and learning
    For idle dreams of things that cannot be:

To-day, I will seek not the shadowy region;
    Its unsustaining vastness waxes drear;
And visions rising, legion after legion,
    Bring the unreal world too strangely near.

I'll walk, but not in old heroic traces,
    And not in paths of high morality,
And not among the half-distinguished faces,
    The clouded forms of long-past history.

I'll walk where my own nature would be leading:
    It vexes me to choose another guide:
Where the gray flocks in ferny glens are feeding;
    Where the wild wind blows on the mountain side.

What have those lonely mountains worth revealing?
    More glory and more grief than I can tell:
The earth that wakes one human heart to feeling
    Can centre both the worlds of Heaven and Hell.","""I'll walk, but not in old heroic traces, not in paths of high morality, and not among the half-distinguished faces, long-past history,"" he writes. ""Where the gray flocks in ferny glens are feeding; where the wild wind blows on the mountain side"""
"Adonais, 49-52, [Go thou to Rome]","                  49

    Go thou to Rome,—at once the Paradise,
    The grave, the city, and the wilderness;
    And where its wrecks like shattered mountains rise,
    And flowering weeds, and fragrant copses dress
    The bones of Desolation's nakedness
    Pass, till the spirit of the spot shall lead
    Thy footsteps to a slope of green access
    Where, like an infant's smile, over the dead
A light of laughing flowers along the grass is spread;

                  50
      
    And gray walls moulder round, on which dull Time
    Feeds, like slow fire upon a hoary brand;
    And one keen pyramid with wedge sublime,
    Pavilioning the dust of him who planned
    This refuge for his memory, doth stand
    Like flame transformed to marble; and beneath,
    A field is spread, on which a newer band
    Have pitched in Heaven's smile their camp of death,
Welcoming him we lose with scarce extinguished breath.

                  51
      
    Here pause: these graves are all too young as yet
    To have outgrown the sorrow which consigned
    Its charge to each; and if the seal is set,
    Here, on one fountain of a mourning mind,
    Break it not thou! too surely shalt thou find
    Thine own well full, if thou returnest home,
    Of tears and gall. From the world's bitter wind
    Seek shelter in the shadow of the tomb.
What Adonais is, why fear we to become?

                  52
      
    The One remains, the many change and pass;
    Heaven's light forever shines, Earth's shadows fly;
    Life, like a dome of many-coloured glass,
    Stains the white radiance of Eternity,
    Until Death tramples it to fragments.—Die,
    If thou wouldst be with that which thou dost seek!
    Follow where all is fled!—Rome's azure sky,
    Flowers, ruins, statues, music, words, are weak
The glory they transfuse with fitting truth to speak.","Rome is the Paradise, the grave, the city, and the wilderness; and where its wrecks like shattered mountains rise. The bones of Desolation's nakedness pass, till the spirit of the spot shall lead thee to a slope of green access."
"September 1, 1939","I sit in one of the dives
On Fifty-second Street
Uncertain and afraid
As the clever hopes expire
Of a low dishonest decade:
Waves of anger and fear
Circulate over the bright
And darkened lands of the earth,
Obsessing our private lives;
The unmentionable odour of death
Offends the September night.
Accurate scholarship can
Unearth the whole offence
From Luther until now
That has driven a culture mad,
Find what occurred at Linz,
What huge imago made
A psychopathic god:
I and the public know
What all schoolchildren learn,
Those to whom evil is done
Do evil in return.
Exiled Thucydides knew
All that a speech can say
About Democracy,
And what dictators do,
The elderly rubbish they talk
To an apathetic grave;
Analysed all in his book,
The enlightenment driven away,
The habit-forming pain,
Mismanagement and grief:
We must suffer them all again.
Into this neutral air
Where blind skyscrapers use
Their full height to proclaim
The strength of Collective Man,
Each language pours its vain
Competitive excuse:
But who can live for long
In an euphoric dream;
Out of the mirror they stare,
Imperialism's face
And the international wrong.
Faces along the bar
Cling to their average day:
The lights must never go out,
The music must always play,
All the conventions conspire
To make this fort assume
The furniture of home;
Lest we should see where we are,
Lost in a haunted wood,
Children afraid of the night
Who have never been happy or good.
The windiest militant trash
Important Persons shout
Is not so crude as our wish:
What mad Nijinsky wrote
About Diaghilev
Is true of the normal heart;
For the error bred in the bone
Of each woman and each man
Craves what it cannot have,
Not universal love
But to be loved alone.
From the conservative dark
Into the ethical life
The dense commuters come,
Repeating their morning vow;
""I will be true to the wife,
I'll concentrate more on my work,""
And helpless governors wake
To resume their compulsory game:
Who can release them now,
Who can reach the deaf,
Who can speak for the dumb?
All I have is a voice
To undo the folded lie,
The romantic lie in the brain
Of the sensual man-in-the-street
And the lie of Authority
Whose buildings grope the sky:
There is no such thing as the State
And no one exists alone;
Hunger allows no choice
To the citizen or the police;
We must love one another or die.
Defenceless under the night
Our world in stupor lies;
Yet, dotted everywhere,
Ironic points of light
Flash out wherever the Just
Exchange their messages:
May I, composed like them
Of Eros and of dust,
Beleaguered by the same
Negation and despair,
Show an affirming flame.",I sit in one of the dives on Fifty-second Street. The unmentionable odour of death violates the September night. Accurate scholarship can uncover the whole offence that has driven a culture mad.
Landscape with the Fall of Icarus,"According to Brueghel

London,"I wander thro’ each charter’d street,
Near where the charter’d Thames does flow,
And mark in every face I meet
Marks of weakness, marks of woe.
In every cry of every man,
In every Infant’s cry of fear,
In every voice, in every ban,
The mind-forg’d manacles I hear.
How the Chimney-sweeper’s cry
Every blackning Church appalls;
And the hapless Soldier’s sigh
Runs in blood down Palace walls.
But most thro’ midnight streets I hear
How the youthful Harlot’s curse
Blasts the new-born Infant’s tear,
And blights with plagues the Marriage hearse.","""I wander thro’ each charter’d street, near where the charter'd Thames does flow, and mark in every face I meetMarks of weakness, marks of woe"" ""In every cry of every man, every Infant's cry of fear,                In every voice, in every ban,                The mind-forg'd manacles I hear"""

The Innocents,"To forego the prodigy of verse

The helpless span narration cannot close.
Route nor spectacle will not go blind
Nor bind their broken conscience to a page: 
Learn to be No-one in the voice of none, 
Friend in that friendless element forever 
Unbegun, a sea, a body, a remorse—
Take up this leaf: what do the dead, 
The unborn defend? Your living syllable 
Too mute, too loyal to its desuetude 
To enter speech that does not speak 
Consent, and claim, and failure to conclude.",The poem was written in the first half of the 20th century. It is about the choice between suicide and redemption for the soul of the person who commits suicide.
The Palace of Forty Pillars,"Isfahan is half the world
I
Twenty pillars drip into the pool
their likenesses, where the likeness of a boy
wavers among the clouds, eyeing the boy
who’s waiting for another. All is dual:
two rows of roses frame the pool, in twos
the swans glide, each on another’s breast, then fuse
in a headless embrace. All is dissolved:
the boy outside the water is no more
a boy inside the water—his no more
the face defaced by its own lines on shattered
waves overlapping like a rose, the tattered
pillars strewn like petals. All is halved,
severed, like home and school, like love and being
loved—the boy no more than a way of seeing.","Twenty pillars drip into the pool where the likeness of a boy                wavers among the clouds. All is dual:two rows of roses frame the pool, in twos                the swans glide, each on another’s breast, then fuse                in a headless embrace."
Swan Song,"after the Persian of Mehdi Hamidi Shirazi
They say when the time comes for a swan to die,
it goes where other swans have gone to die.
They say as the last night begins to fall,
it trails behind the setting sun to die.
And it sings ghazals, as though it wished between
the pages of its own divan to die.
They say a swan loves only once and will
return to where its love was won to die.
Making its deathbed where it first made love,
it can forget it has withdrawn to die.
Are these tales true? In the desert, where I live,
no swan has come, not a single one, to die.
But then they say that swans return to water,
in whose embrace life was begun, to die.
Open your arms, my dear, and slake my thirst:
the time has come for one more swan to die.","The Persian of Mehdi Hamidi Shirazi is famous for his tales of swans. He says that when a swan dies, it returns to the place where it first made love."
The Yellow Swan,"I love the black swan.
—James Merrill, “The Black Swan”
At noon the pedaled swans afloat midstream
                 or parked at the water’s rim
find the boy first in line or there before
there is a line, and always the nice boatman
lets him mount his favorite ride, whose name 
                defies all rust and wear.
        He whispers, I love the yellow swan,
a secret he knows better than to share
                 save in the hollow ear-
like curve of that arched neck whose mirror image
breaks on rings of water as he climbs
between the wings and pedals from the pier, 
                a trail of molted plumage
         shuddering in his wake. The river foams,
churned by the paddle wheel and changed to ocean,
                 its surface cut by the question
mark of the swan—no, dragon!—gliding on
the hissing bloodstained waters as he turns
fire on darkness, almost wins his mission
                 while his parents chat in the sun,
         unaware of all that burns
down on the other bank. But like most love 
                the swan-ride is cut off.
The stroke of one o’clock returns the beast
to boat, the boat to boatman. He hates the boatman.
He hates his parents, whom he won’t forgive. 
                He hates the girl who’s next.
         Poor boy, he hates the yellow swan.","James Merrill’s “The Black Swan’ is about a boy and his love of swans. The boy rides the swan, a secret he knows better than to share with the world. He climbs between the wings and pedals from the pier, leaving a trail of molted plumage behind."
Coming Out of the Shower,"I shut my eyes under the scalding stream, 
                scrubbing off last night’s dream,
when suddenly I hear your voice again 
         as though it caught in the clogged drain
and was sent bubbling back up from the other 
                world where you’re not my mother.
This time, it’s really you. I’m really here. 
        I blink. We do not disappear.
Dad left, you say, to shower at the shop 
                so I don’t need to stop
just yet—and yet I do, unable to
         resume old customs, unlike you.
In a one-bath four-person household, we 
                learn what we mustn’t see,
growing, in time, so coolly intimate 
        with one another’s silhouette
behind the opaque frosted shower screen 
                that once more stands between
us two. While at the mirror you apply 
        foundation and concealer, I
wash out my hair with rosewater shampoo, 
                which means I’ll smell like you
all day. Mama, I shout, I’m coming out,
        and as you look away I knot
around me tight your lavender robe de chambre, 
                cinching my waist, and clamber
out of the tub, taking care not to step
         outside the cotton mat and drip
on the cracked floor you’ve polished with such zeal 
                we’re mirrored in each tile.
Yet, you’d forgive the spillage, or forget. 
        What else will you love me despite?","In a one-bath four-person household, we learn what we mustn’t see. We become so coolly intimate with one another’s silhouette. We’re mirrored in each tile."
Stare at the Sea,"Stare at the sea, the sea is blind.
The sea gives back your theme—
The sea that is not like, that cannot lack 
A thing
              —you have heard this sea intoned 
To every shock of chaos and of calm, 
As though soul’s torn two intellects 
Would marry in that hollow heave 
The harm they cannot fatalize, the thing 
A stonier dumb charm would weave 
Out of its own locked raging tides: 
The sea holds nothing it can hide.
Teach the sea to sing, the soul 
To drink its own imagining.
 ","The sea holds nothing it can hide. Stare at the sea, the sea is blind. The sea that is not like, that cannot lack."
Pilgrim Heights,"Something, something, the heart here 
Misses, something it knows it needs 
Unable to bless—the wind passes; 
A swifter shadow sweeps the reeds, 
The heart a colder contrast brushes.
So this fool, face-forward, belly 
Pressed among the rushes, plays out 
His pulse to the dune’s long slant 
Down from blue to bluer element, 
The bold encompassing drink of air
And namelessness, a length compound
Of want and oneness the shore’s mumbling 
Distantly tells—something a wing’s 
Dry pivot stresses, carved 
Through barrens of stillness and glare:
The naked close of light in light,
Light’s spare embrace of blade and tremor 
Stealing the generous eye’s plunder 
Like a breathing banished from the lung’s 
Fever, lost in parenthetic air.
Raiding these nude recesses, the hawk 
Resumes his yielding balance, his shadow 
Swims the field, the sands beyond, 
The narrow edges fed out to light, 
To the sea’s eternal licking monochrome.
The foolish hip, the elbow bruise
Upright from the dampening mat, 
The twisted grasses turn, unthatch, 
Light-headed blood renews its stammer—
Apart, below, the dazed eye catches
A darkened figure abruptly measured 
Where folding breakers lay their whites; 
The heart from its height starts downward, 
Swum in that perfect pleasure 
It knows it needs, unable to bless.",’s spare embrace of blade and tremor. ‘I can’t help it. I’m just here.’ “I’ve got to get out of here’. ’’‘I have to go home’
canción,"for Dzvinia Orlowsky
When I die, I want Papi’s boleros in air. Quémame con su canción.

After Papi’s death, 8 songs are growing in my throat. His orphan’s

"This Time, Not an Intruder","Kids’ Club After-School Program, The Gray House, March 2015
Fear made me block the side door with the chain.
A woman, glassy-eyed, rang the bell as if on fire.
Say “stranger” and the kids’ heads pop up like lemmings,
the memory of an intruder in our program last year,
that snarling voice that is mine yet not mine—a live
current under their skin. Rushed to the front door,
kids are matched to names to faces to signatures
and the side bell rings again. This time, I open
that door wide to confront a woman dark-lit by the sun,
words tangling like brambles in her mouth.
Photographing the homeless? None here.
I wave her down the ramp, trash bags
in one hand, rush to lock up the house,
feel my energy ebb. Second trash run.
She’s still there, turning the air
above the steering wheel. Then slumps.
Tell me how an angel feels. Not this panic.
I run in and dial. A cop raps on the car window
she forgets how to open. 25—the blood sugar
level she shouldn’t have, if she wants to live.

This Too Shall Pass,"was no consolation to the woman
whose husband was strung out on opioids.
Gone to a better place: useless and suspect intel
for the couple at their daughter’s funeral

before a casket with a princess motif. 
Some moments can’t be eased
and it’s no good offering clichés like stale
meat to a tiger with a taste for human suffering.
When I hear the word miracle I want to throw up
on a platter of deviled eggs. Everything happens
for a reason: more good tidings someone will try
to trepan your skull to insert. When fire
inhales your house, you don’t care what the haiku says
about seeing the rising moon. You want
an avalanche to bury you. You want to lie down
under a slab of snow, dumb as a jarred
sideshow embryo. What a circus.
The tents dismantled, the train moving on,
always moving, starting slow and gaining speed,
taking you where you never wanted to go.","It's no good offering clichés like stalemeat to a tiger with a taste for human suffering.

You’re the Top,"Last night I get all the way to Ocean Street Extension, squinting through the windshield, wipers smearing the rain, lights of the oncoming cars half-blinding me. The baby’s in her seat in the back singing the first three words of You’re the Top. Not softly and sweetly the way she did when she woke in her crib, but belting it out like Ethel Merman. I don’t drive much at night anymore. And then the rain and the bad wipers. But I tell myself it’s too soon to give it up. Though the dark seems darker than I ever remember. And as I make the turn and head uphill, I can’t find the lines on the road. I start to panic. No! Yes—the lights! I flick them on and the world resolves. My god, I could have killed her. And I’ll think about that more later. But right now new galaxies are being birthed in my chest. There are no gods, but not everyone is cursed every moment. There are minutes, hours, sometimes even whole days when the earth is spinning 1.6 million miles around the sun and nothing tragic happens to you. I do not have to enter the land of everlasting sorrow. Every mistake I’ve made, every terrible decision—how I married the wrong man, hurt my child, didn’t go to Florence when she was dying—I take it all because the baby is commanding, “Sing, Nana.” And I sing, You’re the top. You’re the Coliseum, and the baby comes in right on cue.","The author's daughter is singing You're the Top in the back seat of her car.

        only in english, the only language that counts

The Alpine Sheep,"When on my ear your loss was knelled,
    And tender sympathy upburst, 
A little spring from memory welled,
    Which once had quenched my bitter thirst.
And I was fain to bear to you
    A portion of its mild relief, 
That it might be as healing dew,
    To steal some fever from your grief.
After our child’s untroubled breath
    Up to the Father took its way, 
And on our home the shade of Death
    Like a long twilight haunting lay,
And friends came round, with us to weep
    Her little spirit’s swift remove, 
The story of the Alpine sheep
    Was told to us by one we love.
They, in the valley’s sheltering care, 
    Soon crop the meadow’s tender prime,
And when the sod grows brown and bare, 
    The shepherd strives to make them climb
To airy shelves of pasture green, 
    That hang along the mountain’s side,
Where grass and flowers together lean, 
    And down through mist the sunbeams slide.
But naught can tempt the timid things 
    The steep and rugged paths to try,
Though sweet the shepherd calls and sings, 
    And seared below the pastures lie,
Till in his arms their lambs he takes,
    Along the dizzy verge to go; 
Then, heedless of the rifts and breaks,
    They follow on, o’er rock and snow.
And in those pastures, lifted fair, 
    More dewy-soft than lowland mead,
The shepherd drops his tender care, 
    And sheep and lambs together feed.
This parable, by Nature breathed, 
    Blew on me as the south-wind free
O’er frozen brooks, that flow unsheathed 
    From icy thraldom to the sea.
A blissful vision, through the night, 
    Would all my happy senses sway,
Of the good Shepherd on the height, 
    Or climbing up the starry way,
Holding our little lamb asleep,— 
    While, like the murmur of the sea,
Sounded that voice along the deep,
    Saying, “Arise and follow me!”","The story of the Alpine sheep was told to us by one we love. When on my ear your loss was knelled, a little spring from memory welled. The shepherd drops his tender care, and sheep and lambs together feed."

Twenty-one stars pin this mother’s grief
to royal blue, the sclera of her eyes, scarlet.
She can no longer see, no longer count.
Her hands press against her Sunday dress
her remaining son, her remaining daughter
—still wet from the bath—still safe
in their unknowing. They stand on tiptoe,
one on each of her broad brown feet, to keep
her from falling, from reading with her fingertips
the blooming glyphs of blood, names
of massacred in this country
she’s still afraid to call home. ","Twenty-one stars pin this mother’s grief to royal blue, the sclera of her eyes, scarlet. She can no longer see, no longer count. Her remaining son, her remaining daughter are still safe."
Emesis,"From   her   perch   on  the  docent’s  gloved  wrist,  she
watches   us with the eyes  of any creature handled  too
much:  featherless head a closed door,  body a mask of
silence.   In   the  steep   twilight  descending  like   the
backwards  count of a  nurse’s  voice leading  a patient
into  unconsciousness,   the   handler  explains  to  our
circle   the  generalities    of   the   species—the    turkey

regurgitation   of   semi-digested    meat    that  is   then
vomited      onto     a       predator’s        face—and     the
particularities of this one, who had come   to them with
a broken wing.  I, too,  have places on my body  knitted
back together by unseen hands,  scars laid while I slept
the   sleep  of  the  unknowing:    one  above  the    belly
button,  and  another  below where   two  fingers   must
have parted the dark hair before shaving a path.   Does
she remember  the first faces to peer toward her  as she
surfaced?  Every time  I try to write  what those   hands
did,  I end   up  plunging  my own   fingers deep   inside

me.  Oh, the shudder of her black-feathered shoulders.

To the Dandelion,"    Dear common flower, that grow’st beside the way, 
Fringing the dusty road with harmless gold, 
          First pledge of blithesome May, 
Which children pluck, and full of pride, uphold,
   High-hearted buccaneers, o’erjoyed that they
      Eldorado in the grass have found, 
        Which not the rich earth’s ample round 
    May match in wealth, thou art more dear to me
   Than all the prouder summer-blooms may be. 
    Gold such as thine ne’er drew the Spanish prow
Through the primeval hush of Indian seas, 
          Nor wrinkled the lean brow 
Of age, to rob the lover’s heart of ease; 
   ’Tis the Spring’s largess, which she scatters now 
To rich and poor alike, with lavish hand, 
       Though most heart never understand 
    To take it at God’s value, but pass by 
    The offered wealth with unrewarded eye. 
    Thou art my tropics and mine Italy; 
To look at thee unlocks a warmer clime; 
          The eyes thou givest me 
Are in the heart, and heed not space or time:
    Not in mid June the golden-cuirassed bee
Feels a more summer-like warm ravishment 
       In the white lily’s breezy tent,
    His fragrant Sybaris, than I, when first 
    From the dark green thy yellow circles burst. 
    Then think I of deep shadows on the grass, 
Of meadows where in sun the cattle graze, 
          Where, as the breezes pass, 
The gleaming rushes lean a thousand ways, 
   Of leaves that slumber in a cloud mass, 
Or whiten in the wind, of waters blue 
      That from the distance sparkle through 
    Some woodland gap, and of a sky above, 
    Where one white cloud like a stray lamb doth move.
    My childhood’s earliest thoughts are linked with thee;
The sight of thee calls back the robin’s song,
          Who, from the dark old tree 
Beside the door, sang clearly all day long, 
     And I, secure in childish piety, 
Listened as if I heard an angel sing
        With news from heaven, which he could bring 
    Fresh every day to my untainted ears 
    When birds and flowers and I were happy peers. 
    How like a prodigal doth nature seem, 
When thou, for all thy gold, so common art! 
          Thou teachest me to deem
More sacredly of every human heart, 
    Since each reflects in joy its scanty gleam 
Of heaven, and could some wondrous secret show, 
       Did we but pay the love we owe, 
    And with a child’s undoubting wisdom look 
    On all these living pages of God’s book. ",The poem was written by the Italian poet Giorgio Agambini. It is set in the Italian tropics and Italy in the summer of 18th century.
Parable of the South Pole Buddha,"... the most tiny quantity of reality 
ever imagined by a human being

A physicist is stuck in a bunker at the South Pole, 
freezing his burrito off, and trying to detect the rare light
given off by one in six billion neutrinos streaking through 
the glacial ice, and it turns out he’s a guy I like 
talking poetry with sometimes and before he zooms 
to the white continent he tries to explain neutrinos to me 
like a priest describing the progress of the spirit to a child. 
  No, they’re not that three-piece punk band
from Philadelphia, making dancers oscillate in clubs
then fall into each other like so much dark matter.
Like most of us, they have a mean life and a half life.
Like most of us they decay too fast. But here’s the wonder:
these particles are so tiny, so unaffected, they shoot 
right through the planet and through us without so much 
as setting an electron quivering like a dragonfly’s wing. 
I wish I could do that, instead of lying in bed, 
feeling gravity glue me to the indentation in the mattress,
wish I could jet right through the world
like cosmic rain, a flight of neutrinos shaped like a poet 
and riding on the magic carpet of a weightless bed.
No tax forms, no lawyers, no dentists to drill 
through the crown to the rot and murder the root—
just stick my face in the pillow and jellyfish through.
I try to let go of my body, to drop without a parachute, 
a little Buddha, neither hot nor cold, but I can’t lift off 
like my friend who’s gone to glacial nowhere
and who sets up his machines while the unseen wind 
whishes by into the heart of cold, thinking 
he can measure the invisible, thinking he might actually 
understand what distinguishes us from nothing.","A physicist is stuck in a bunker at the South Pole, trying to detect the rare light given off by one in six billion neutrinos streaking through glacial ice.

Lobster,"At Shaw’s Market the lobster tank sits
to the right of the fish counter, just left 
of the freezer with the fish sticks and frozen 
perch. Therein lie the lobsters, stacked like 
so many traps, brackish and silent, their pincers 
rendered useless, wrapped shut tight in yellow 
plastic. Scuttled into these briny and light-dulled 
shallows, they hulk like the wrecks of some 
forgotten sea floor. One evening, uneasy, 
I went home to read what I could: phylum, 
arthropoda – cousins to trilobites, crabs, insects, 
spiders. I studied the neurobiology, learned 
lobsters have hundreds of eyes but do not see, 
not exactly, and I thought of one I judged 
somnolent flinching his taped pincers at my 
reflection looming like an eclipse, my domestic-
ated glimpse into the deep, what terror
he must have felt coupled with an absence 
of sediment that must have felt like, well, 
nothing. Six hundred million years, I thought 
of him there, sedated, stunned by the salt light. 
The next day I returned intending to purchase 
several and set them free; failing, I drove by 
myself to the beach where I stared at the sea. 
Lobsters once ruled all I could see, their armored 
carapaces inviolable, feeding on anything that 
might be. Lords of the Cambrian prehistory, 
they crawled out of time and into the late 
Quaternary, which is to say, us, left to rule 
the world as we must. What thief waits for 
me, I can’t help but think, as I leave the store
with my groceries, feel my way through the lot
looking for my lost sedan, crawling with unease
through the summer dark and soft salt-breeze?","Lobsters once ruled all I could see, their armored armored carapaces inviolable, feeding on anything that  might be. Lords of the Cambrian prehistory, they crawled out of time and into the late Quaternary, left to rule the world as we must."

Blackbird,"(Miles Davis, 1926–1991)
This is what heroin must feel like—
Miles Davis exacting
his way through “Autumn Leaves”—
pretty and cold, a slowly spreading frost
along synapses and veins,
mapping interstellar darkness
one blue note at a time. Sometimes you could hear
him thinking through the changes
like he was hunting himself, relentless
and without mercy, then a burst of blue
flame, squeezing the Harmon mute like a man screaming
from the bottom of a mine shaft—
but however brightly the darkness glows,
it is still darkness, and Miles was a blackbird
on a field of snow, beautiful, distant, quiet—
and however many steps you take to meet him he flies
ten more feet away.","""Autumn Leaves"" is one of Miles Davis' best-known works. The song is about a heroin addict mapping interstellar darkness one blue note at a time."
Epithalamium,"And it came to him that the question was loneliness-
when he grit his teeth, rearranging
his bones
                and self in an easy
chair, which would,
                                      as he thought, trigger
the worry he might dial her in the middle
of the night
                    only to hang up before she answers.
Then there were the variations: the loneliness
he wore with— no, like-
               a good sweater— while he sat in restaurants
reading magazines; while he explained
his life to people he met on airplanes; what made him
stand at the window thinking, without irony,
the private autumnal heart
is the last leaf to fall …
what resolved into a fugue
of silence, counterpoint
                                                 of all he would
never fully describe. As in the night he said
he loved her: billowing stars; black leaves;
berceuse wind. A sky
of stars, leaves, and wind. He remembered
thinking, with her in his arms,
of loneliness. What should he say? That they
would spend their evenings in metaphor,
in a house of silent song? That there
would be children?
Pray, love, that it be so simple.","Lonely is the last leaf to fall. Loneliness is the private autumnal heart of all he would never fully describe. He remembered thinking, with her in his arms, of loneliness. What should he say?"

One Cup of Chai,"If I had known that the cup of chai

in the kitchen, to make her

having blended water and milk 
in such strange ratios 
that when reduced and strained
the tea came up 
to barely one trisection of my pinkie
(that cup was the driest well I saw, 
the lowest tide) so to cover my blunder
I poured raw tap water to flood her cup 
and fled her room before she could 
collect her body, bring lip to saucer, 
had I known that the pale, putrid mess 
I presented, was after all, the only and 
last cup of tea I’d ever make her
would I have suddenly been 
granted the culinary wisdom to brew 
instead the pot with sprigs of lemongrass,
a pod of cardamom, perhaps even 
a prestigious thread of saffron
that I’d sneak from the silver hexagonal box 
she kept hidden behind the airtight jars 
of pricey nuts, and bring her
a creamy drink of complex caffeine, even
make some magnanimous promise 
of offering her tea on tap till she lived 
but knowing me, I know I’d have just 
continued being the spectacular failure I was 
that day, shit-talking my every inability 
out of her sight, embarrassed by failure, 
afraid of consequence and knowing her, 
she would have creased her nose 
at first, then continued to descend 
on the plate with the hopeful pull 
of her slurp, stubborn as she was, 
not willing to peg one finite judgement
of adulation or derision— 
on the cup she was served","My mother asked me, a drifter, to make her a cup of chai that afternoon.

Abecedarian on the Good Father,"As he holds his wife’s hand, the nurse tells him to
breathe. He will be a good father. He 
could be. His wife tows a boat on land with her teeth. 
Don’t worry. Good father. Breathe. Later,
everyone smiles when he jogs with the stroller. He 
feigns interest in ponies. He pushes a swing and his daughter
giggles. He applies sunblock, and 
helps warm the bottle, and he is
inducted into the fatherly hall of fame. He 
jumps on the trampoline, and the chorus sings Good Father. He wipes
ketchup off her cheek at the zoo, and the old women 
laud. He is told he is a new breed of
man. Evolved. His knuckles just barely or
never scraping the ground. He hugs
often enough, packs her lunch, and the crowd 
pours on the applause. He lays her down for 
quiet time. It goes somewhat well. 
Rejoice, the people shout, for here is a
saint, as he lifts diapers to the conveyor belt.
Truthfully, he feels slightly
unwell. A bowl of plastic fruit is pretty, but 
vaguely toxic. He sleeps fine
without a mouth affixed to his chest. His bottle of
Xanax is half full. The nurse says,
You will be a good father. He jogs with the stroller. He reaches the
zenith of a very small hill. ","The author's wife tells him he will be a good father. He jogs with the stroller, pushes a swing and his daughter giggles. He hugs her often enough, packs her lunch, and the crowd applauds."
In Praise of Mystery: A Poem for Europa,"Arching under the night sky inky
with black expansiveness, we point
to the planets we know, we

pin quick wishes on stars. From earth,
we read the sky as if it is an unerring book
of the universe, expert and evident.

Still, there are mysteries below our sky:
the whale song, the songbird singing
its call in the bough of a wind-shaken tree.

We are creatures of constant awe,
curious at beauty, at leaf and blossom,
at grief and pleasure, sun and shadow.

And it is not darkness that unites us,
not the cold distance of space, but
the offering of water, each drop of rain,

each rivulet, each pulse, each vein.
O second moon, we, too, are made
of water, of vast and beckoning seas.

We, too, are made of wonders, of great
and ordinary loves, of small invisible worlds,
of a need to call out through the dark.","From earth, we read the sky as if it is an unerring bookof the universe, expert and evident. But there are mysteries below our sky: whale song, the songbird singing in the bough of a wind-shaken tree."
A Line-storm Song,"The line-storm clouds fly tattered and swift, 
  The road is forlorn all day, 
Where a myriad snowy quartz stones lift, 
  And the hoof-prints vanish away. 
The roadside flowers, too wet for the bee,
  Expend their bloom in vain. 
Come over the hills and far with me, 
  And be my love in the rain. 
The birds have less to say for themselves 
  In the wood-world’s torn despair
Than now these numberless years the elves, 
  Although they are no less there: 
All song of the woods is crushed like some 
  Wild, easily shattered rose. 
Come, be my love in the wet woods; come,
  Where the boughs rain when it blows. 
There is the gale to urge behind 
  And bruit our singing down, 
And the shallow waters aflutter with wind 
  From which to gather your gown.    
What matter if we go clear to the west, 
  And come not through dry-shod? 
For wilding brooch shall wet your breast 
  The rain-fresh goldenrod. 
Oh, never this whelming east wind swells   
  But it seems like the sea’s return 
To the ancient lands where it left the shells 
  Before the age of the fern; 
And it seems like the time when after doubt 
  Our love came back amain.      
Oh, come forth into the storm and rout 
  And be my love in the rain.",The poem is set in the rain-soaked woods of northern England. It is the story of a love affair between a man and a woman in the woods.
The Weary Blues,"Droning a drowsy syncopated tune,
Rocking back and forth to a mellow croon,
     I heard a Negro play.
Down on Lenox Avenue the other night
By the pale dull pallor of an old gas light
     He did a lazy sway . . .
     He did a lazy sway . . .
To the tune o’ those Weary Blues.
With his ebony hands on each ivory key
He made that poor piano moan with melody.
     O Blues!
Swaying to and fro on his rickety stool
He played that sad raggy tune like a musical fool.
     Sweet Blues!
Coming from a black man’s soul.
     O Blues!
In a deep song voice with a melancholy tone
I heard that Negro sing, that old piano moan—
     ""Ain’t got nobody in all this world,
       Ain’t got nobody but ma self.
       I’s gwine to quit ma frownin’
       And put ma troubles on the shelf.""
Thump, thump, thump, went his foot on the floor.
He played a few chords then he sang some more—
     ""I got the Weary Blues
       And I can’t be satisfied.
       Got the Weary Blues
       And can’t be satisfied—
       I ain’t happy no mo’
       And I wish that I had died.""
And far into the night he crooned that tune.
The stars went out and so did the moon.
The singer stopped playing and went to bed
While the Weary Blues echoed through his head.
He slept like a rock or a man that's dead.","I heard a Negro play. Droning a drowsy syncopated tune, rocking back and forth to a mellow croon. ""Ain’t got nobody in all this world, but ma self,"" he sang."
Morning in the Burned House,"In the burned house I am eating breakfast.
You understand: there is no house, there is no breakfast,
yet here I am.
The spoon which was melted scrapes against
the bowl which was melted also.
No one else is around.
Where have they gone to, brother and sister,
mother and father? Off along the shore,
perhaps. Their clothes are still on the hangers,
their dishes piled beside the sink,
which is beside the woodstove
with its grate and sooty kettle,
every detail clear,
tin cup and rippled mirror.
The day is bright and songless,
the lake is blue, the forest watchful.
In the east a bank of cloud
rises up silently like dark bread.
I can see the swirls in the oilcloth,
I can see the flaws in the glass,
those flares where the sun hits them.
I can't see my own arms and legs
or know if this is a trap or blessing,
finding myself back here, where everything
in this house has long been over,
kettle and mirror, spoon and bowl,
including my own body,
including the body I had then,
including the body I have now
as I sit at this morning table, alone and happy,
bare child's feet on the scorched floorboards
(I can almost see)
in my burning clothes, the thin green shorts
and grubby yellow T-shirt
holding my cindery, non-existent,
radiant flesh. Incandescent.","In the burned house I am eating breakfast. There is no house, there is no breakfast, yet here I am. I can't see my own arms and legs. I don't know if this is a trap or blessing."
On Living,"I
Living is no laughing matter:
 you must live with great seriousness
  like a squirrel, for example—
   I mean without looking for something beyond and above living,
  I mean living must be your whole occupation.
Living is no laughing matter:
 you must take it seriously,
 so much so and to such a degree
   that, for example, your hands tied behind your back,
                                            your back to the wall,
   or else in a laboratory
 in your white coat and safety glasses,
 you can die for people—
   even for people whose faces you’ve never seen,
   even though you know living
 is the most real, the most beautiful thing.
I mean, you must take living so seriously
   that even at seventy, for example, you’ll plant olive trees—
   and not for your children, either,
   but because although you fear death you don’t believe it,
   because living, I mean, weighs heavier.
II
Let’s say we’re seriously ill, need surgery—
which is to say we might not get up
   from the white table.
Even though it’s impossible not to feel sad
   about going a little too soon,
we’ll still laugh at the jokes being told,
we’ll look out the window to see if it’s raining,
or still wait anxiously
  for the latest newscast. . . 
Let’s say we’re at the front—
 for something worth fighting for, say.
There, in the first offensive, on that very day,
 we might fall on our face, dead.
We’ll know this with a curious anger,
        but we’ll still worry ourselves to death
        about the outcome of the war, which could last years.
Let’s say we’re in prison
and close to fifty,
and we have eighteen more years, say,
                        before the iron doors will open.
We’ll still live with the outside,
with its people and animals, struggle and wind—
                                I  mean with the outside beyond the walls.
I mean, however and wherever we are,
        we must live as if we will never die.
III
This earth will grow cold,
a star among stars
               and one of the smallest,
a gilded mote on blue velvet—
   I mean this, our great earth.
This earth will grow cold one day,
not like a block of ice
or a dead cloud even 
but like an empty walnut it will roll along
   in pitch-black space . . . 
You must grieve for this right now
—you have to feel this sorrow now—
for the world must be loved this much
                               if you’re going to say “I lived”. . .","Living is no laughing matter: you must take it seriously, so much so and to such a degree that, for example, your hands are tied behind your back. You can die for people, even for people whose faces you’ve never seen, even though you know living is the most real, the most beautiful thing."
I Could Be a Whale Shark,"                     Bolinao, Philippines
 I am worried about tentacles.
How you can still get stung
even if the jelly arm disconnects
from the bell. My husband
swims without me—farther
out to sea than I would like,
buoyed by salt and rind of kelp.
I am worried if I step too far
into the China Sea, my baby
will slow the beautiful kicks
he has just begun since we landed.
The quickening, they call it, 
but all I am is slow, a moon jelly
floating like a bag in the sea.
Or a whale shark. Yes—I could be
a whale shark, newly spotted
with moles from the pregnancy—
my wide mouth always open
to eat and eat with a look that says
Surprise! Did I eat that much?
When I sleep, I am a flutefish,
just lying there, swaying back
and forth among the kelpy mess
of sheets. You can see the wet
of my dark eye awake, awake. 
My husband is a pale blur 
near the horizon, full of adobo
and not waiting thirty minutes 
before swimming. He is free
and waves at me as he backstrokes
past. This is how he prepares
for fatherhood. Such tenderness
still lingers in the air: the Roman
poet Virgil gave his pet fly
the most lavish funeral, complete
with meat feast and barrels 
of oaky wine. You can never know
where or why you hear
a humming on this soft earth.

Theme for English B,"The instructor said,
    Go home and write
    a page tonight.
    And let that page come out of you—
    Then, it will be true.
I wonder if it's that simple?
I am twenty-two, colored, born in Winston-Salem.
I went to school there, then Durham, then here
to this college on the hill above Harlem.
I am the only colored student in my class.
The steps from the hill lead down into Harlem,
through a park, then I cross St. Nicholas,
Eighth Avenue, Seventh, and I come to the Y,
the Harlem Branch Y, where I take the elevator
up to my room, sit down, and write this page:
It's not easy to know what is true for you or me
at twenty-two, my age. But I guess I'm what
I feel and see and hear, Harlem, I hear you:
hear you, hear me—we two—you, me, talk on this page.
(I hear New York, too.) Me—who?
Well, I like to eat, sleep, drink, and be in love.
I like to work, read, learn, and understand life.
I like a pipe for a Christmas present,
or records—Bessie, bop, or Bach.
I guess being colored doesn't make me not like
the same things other folks like who are other races.
So will my page be colored that I write?
Being me, it will not be white.
But it will be
a part of you, instructor.
You are white—
yet a part of me, as I am a part of you.
That's American.
Sometimes perhaps you don't want to be a part of me.
Nor do I often want to be a part of you.
But we are, that's true!
As I learn from you,
I guess you learn from me—
although you're older—and white—
and somewhat more free.
This is my page for English B.","The author is a colored student at a college in Harlem, New York City. He writes about his experiences at school and at the YMCA. ""I like to work, read, learn, and understand life,"" he writes."

Poem [Lana Turner has collapsed!],"Lana Turner has collapsed!
I was trotting along and suddenly
it started raining and snowing
and you said it was hailing
but hailing hits you on the head
hard so it was really snowing and
raining and I was in such a hurry
to meet you but the traffic
was acting exactly like the sky
and suddenly I see a headline

there is no snow in Hollywood
there is no rain in California
I have been to lots of parties
and acted perfectly disgraceful
but I never actually collapsed

Dream Variations,"To fling my arms wide

In the Waiting Room,"In Worcester, Massachusetts,
I went with Aunt Consuelo
to keep her dentist's appointment
and sat and waited for her
in the dentist's waiting room.
It was winter. It got dark
early. The waiting room
was full of grown-up people,
arctics and overcoats,
lamps and magazines.
My aunt was inside
what seemed like a long time
and while I waited I read
the National Geographic
(I could read) and carefully
studied the photographs:
the inside of a volcano,
black, and full of ashes;
then it was spilling over
in rivulets of fire.
Osa and Martin Johnson
dressed in riding breeches,
laced boots, and pith helmets.
A dead man slung on a pole
--""Long Pig,"" the caption said.
Babies with pointed heads
wound round and round with string;
black, naked women with necks
wound round and round with wire
like the necks of light bulbs.
Their breasts were horrifying.
I read it right straight through.
I was too shy to stop.
And then I looked at the cover:
the yellow margins, the date.
Suddenly, from inside,
came an oh! of pain
--Aunt Consuelo's voice--
not very loud or long.
I wasn't at all surprised;
even then I knew she was
a foolish, timid woman.
I might have been embarrassed,
but wasn't. What took me
completely by surprise
was that it was me:
my voice, in my mouth.
Without thinking at all
I was my foolish aunt,
I--we--were falling, falling,
our eyes glued to the cover
of the National Geographic,
February, 1918.
I said to myself: three days
and you'll be seven years old.
I was saying it to stop
the sensation of falling off
the round, turning world.
into cold, blue-black space.
But I felt: you are an I,
you are an Elizabeth,
you are one of them.
Why should you be one, too?
I scarcely dared to look
to see what it was I was.
I gave a sidelong glance
--I couldn't look any higher--
at shadowy gray knees,
trousers and skirts and boots
and different pairs of hands
lying under the lamps.
I knew that nothing stranger
had ever happened, that nothing
stranger could ever happen.
Why should I be my aunt,
or me, or anyone?
What similarities--
boots, hands, the family voice
I felt in my throat, or even
the National Geographic
and those awful hanging breasts--
held us all together
or made us all just one?
How--I didn't know any
word for it--how ""unlikely"". . .
How had I come to be here,
like them, and overhear
a cry of pain that could have
got loud and worse but hadn't?
The waiting room was bright
and too hot. It was sliding
beneath a big black wave,
another, and another.
Then I was back in it.
The War was on. Outside,
in Worcester, Massachusetts,
were night and slush and cold,
and it was still the fifth
of February, 1918.","In Worcester, Massachusetts, in February, 1918, Elizabeth was seven years old. She was with her aunt, Consuelo, at her dentist's appointment.

Haunted Houses,"All houses wherein men have lived and died
Are haunted houses. Through the open doors
The harmless phantoms on their errands glide,
With feet that make no sound upon the floors.
We meet them at the door-way, on the stair,
Along the passages they come and go,
Impalpable impressions on the air,
A sense of something moving to and fro.
There are more guests at table than the hosts
Invited; the illuminated hall
Is thronged with quiet, inoffensive ghosts,
As silent as the pictures on the wall.
The stranger at my fireside cannot see
The forms I see, nor hear the sounds I hear;
He but perceives what is; while unto me
All that has been is visible and clear.
We have no title-deeds to house or lands;
Owners and occupants of earlier dates
From graves forgotten stretch their dusty hands,
And hold in mortmain still their old estates.
The spirit-world around this world of sense
Floats like an atmosphere, and everywhere
Wafts through these earthly mists and vapours dense
A vital breath of more ethereal air.
Our little lives are kept in equipoise
By opposite attractions and desires;
The struggle of the instinct that enjoys,
And the more noble instinct that aspires.
These perturbations, this perpetual jar
Of earthly wants and aspirations high,
Come from the influence of an unseen star
An undiscovered planet in our sky.
And as the moon from some dark gate of cloud
Throws o’er the sea a floating bridge of light,
Across whose trembling planks our fancies crowd
Into the realm of mystery and night,—
So from the world of spirits there descends
A bridge of light, connecting it with this,
O'er whose unsteady floor, that sways and bends,
Wander our thoughts above the dark abyss.","All houses wherein men have lived and died are haunted houses. Through the open doors the harmless phantoms on their errands glide. The stranger at my fireside cannot see the forms I see, nor hear the sounds I hear."
The moon rose over the bay. I had a lot of feelings.,"I am taken with the hot animal
of my skin, grateful to swing my limbs
and have them move as I intend, though
my knee, though my shoulder, though something
is torn or tearing. Today, a dozen squid, dead
on the harbor beach: one mostly buried,
one with skin empty as a shell and hollow
feeling, and, though the tentacles look soft,
I do not touch them. I imagine they
were startled to find themselves in the sun.
I imagine the tide simply went out
without them. I imagine they cannot
feel the black flies charting the raised hills
of their eyes. I write my name in the sand:
Donika Kelly. I watch eighteen seagulls
skim the sandbar and lift low in the sky.
I pick up a pebble that looks like a green egg.
To the ditch lily I say I am in love.
To the Jeep parked haphazardly on the narrow
street I am in love. To the roses, white
petals rimmed brown, to the yellow lined
pavement, to the house trimmed in gold I am
in love. I shout with the rough calculus
of walking. Just let me find my way back,
let me move like a tide come in.","Donika Kelly writes about her love of the beach and the people around her. Kelly writes: ""I am taken with the hot animal                of my skin"""
Christmas Bells,"I heard the bells on Christmas Day
Their old, familiar carols play,
    And wild and sweet
    The words repeat
Of peace on earth, good-will to men!
And thought how, as the day had come,
The belfries of all Christendom
    Had rolled along
    The unbroken song
Of peace on earth, good-will to men!
Till ringing, singing on its way,
The world revolved from night to day,
    A voice, a chime,
    A chant sublime
Of peace on earth, good-will to men!
Then from each black, accursed mouth
The cannon thundered in the South,
    And with the sound
    The carols drowned
Of peace on earth, good-will to men!
It was as if an earthquake rent
The hearth-stones of a continent,
    And made forlorn
    The households born
Of peace on earth, good-will to men!
And in despair I bowed my head;
""There is no peace on earth,"" I said;
    ""For hate is strong,
    And mocks the song
Of peace on earth, good-will to men!""
Then pealed the bells more loud and deep:
""God is not dead, nor doth He sleep;
    The Wrong shall fail,
    The Right prevail,
With peace on earth, good-will to men.""","I heard the bells on Christmas Day and thought how, as the day had come, the belfries of all Christendom had rolled along with the unbroken song of peace on earth. The cannon thundered in the South and with the sound the carols drowned out the song."
Mr. Macklin’s Jack O’Lantern,"Mr. Macklin takes his knife 
And carves the yellow pumpkin face: 
Three holes bring eyes and nose to life, 
The mouth has thirteen teeth in place. 
Then Mr. Macklin just for fun 
Transfers the corn-cob pipe from his 
Wry mouth to Jack’s, and everyone 
Dies laughing! O what fun it is 
Till Mr. Macklin draws the shade 
And lights the candle in Jack’s skull. 
Then all the inside dark is made 
As spooky and as horrorful 
As Halloween, and creepy crawl 
The shadows on the tool-house floor, 
With Jack’s face dancing on the wall. 
O Mr. Macklin! where's the door?","Mr. Macklin takes his knife  and carves the yellow pumpkin face:                 Three holes bring eyes and nose to life,                 The mouth has thirteen teeth in place."
One Sister have I in our house (14),"One Sister have I in our house - 
And one a hedge away. 
There's only one recorded, 
But both belong to me.

And wore my past year's gown - 
The other as a bird her nest, 
Builded our hearts among.

It was a different tune -

But up and down the hills 
I held her hand the tighter -         
Which shortened all the miles -

Deceives the Butterfly; 
Still in her Eye 
The Violets lie 
Mouldered this many May.

But took the morn, -

From out the wide night's numbers -

Thanksgiving Day,"Over the river, and through the wood,
  To grandfather's house we go;
       The horse knows the way
       To carry the sleigh
  Through the white and drifted snow.
Over the river, and through the wood—
  Oh, how the wind does blow!
       It stings the toes
       And bites the nose
  As over the ground we go.
Over the river, and through the wood,
  To have a first-rate play.
       Hear the bells ring
       ""Ting-a-ling-ding"",

Over the river, and through the wood
  Trot fast, my dapple-gray!
       Spring over the ground,
       Like a hunting-hound!
  For this is Thanksgiving Day.
Over the river, and through the wood,
  And straight through the barn-yard gate.
       We seem to go
       Extremely slow,—
  It is so hard to wait!
Over the river and through the wood—
  Now grandmother's cap I spy!

  Hurrah for the pumpkin-pie!",The poem was written in the early 20th century. It was written for a group of friends who were traveling on a sleigh on Thanksgiving Day.
Thanksgiving,"We walk on starry fields of white
   And do not see the daisies;
For blessings common in our sight
   We rarely offer praises.
We sigh for some supreme delight
   To crown our lives with splendor,
And quite ignore our daily store
   Of pleasures sweet and tender.
Our cares are bold and push their way
   Upon our thought and feeling.
They hand about us all the day,
   Our time from pleasure stealing.
So unobtrusive many a joy
   We pass by and forget it,
But worry strives to own our lives,
   And conquers if we let it.
There’s not a day in all the year
   But holds some hidden pleasure,
And looking back, joys oft appear
   To brim the past’s wide measure.
But blessings are like friends, I hold,
   Who love and labor near us.
We ought to raise our notes of praise
   While living hearts can hear us.
Full many a blessing wears the guise
   Of worry or of trouble;
Far-seeing is the soul, and wise,
   Who knows the mask is double.
But he who has the faith and strength
   To thank his God for sorrow
Has found a joy without alloy
   To gladden every morrow.
We ought to make the moments notes
   Of happy, glad Thanksgiving;
The hours and days a silent phrase
   Of music we are living.
And so the theme should swell and grow
   As weeks and months pass o’er us,
And rise sublime at this good time,
   A grand Thanksgiving chorus.",We walk on starry fields of white and do not see the daisies. We rarely offer praises. We sigh for some supreme delight. We ignore our daily store of pleasures sweet and tender.

     the dark of churches and schools and clubs and
     societies, associations and councils and committees and 
     conventions, distressed and disturbed and deceived and

     preyed on by facile force of state and fad and novelty, by
     false prophet and holy believer;

    trying to fashion a world that will hold all the people,

    generations;
Let a new earth rise. Let another world be born. Let a
    bloody peace be written in the sky. Let a second
    generation full of courage issue forth; let a people
    loving freedom come to growth. Let a beauty full of
    healing and a strength of final clenching be the pulsing

Vaccinated,"I once saw Jazell Barbie Royale
Do Whitney Houston so well
I got upset with myself for sneaking 
Past the cashier 
After having been patted down. Security frisks you 
For nothing. They don’t believe in trouble. They don’t 
Imagine a gun or a blade, though
Sometimes they make you walk all the way back 
To the car with the weed you didn’t tuck well.
No one’s at fault. That’s how they say it
Where I’m from. Everyone’s got a job. 
I should have paid. Our women
Need to perform for the tips they couldn’t earn
After the state shut down for good reason 
And too late. We lost so many friends. 
My buddy Janir swears 
He still can’t smell his lip balm. Our women need us 
To call them beautiful 
Because they are. They’ve done what they must
To prove it, and how often does any woman get
To hear the truth? Jazell is so pretty.
Whitney Houston is dead. No one wore a mask.
It wasn’t safe, so it wasn’t really free.
If you don’t watch me, I’ll get by you. I’ll take
What I’ve been missing. My mother says 
That’s not how she raised me. I spent 
A year and a half sure she’d die.
The women who lip sync for us could die.
People like to murder them, 
And almost everyone else wonders
If they should be dead. Who got dressed looking 
For safety today? Who got patted down?  My mother 
Says what we do is sin. But all we do 
Is party. Even when I’m broke, I can 
Entertain. You’re going to miss me some day. 
You’re going to forget the words to your favorite song. 
You’re going to miss me when I’m gone.","Where I’m from, everyone’s got a job. Our women need us to call them beautiful. They’ve done what they must to prove it. Jazell is so pretty. No one wore a mask."
"To the Virgins, to Make Much of Time","Gather ye rosebuds while ye may,
   Old Time is still a-flying;
And this same flower that smiles today
   Tomorrow will be dying.
The glorious lamp of heaven, the sun,
   The higher he's a-getting,
The sooner will his race be run,
   And nearer he's to setting.
That age is best which is the first,
   When youth and blood are warmer;
But being spent, the worse, and worst
   Times still succeed the former.
Then be not coy, but use your time,
   And while ye may, go marry;
For having lost but once your prime,
   You may forever tarry.","Gather ye rosebuds while ye may, may ye may. Old Time is still a-flying;. This same flower that smiles today will be dying."
Leda and the Swan,"A sudden blow: the great wings beating still
Above the staggering girl, her thighs caressed
By the dark webs, her nape caught in his bill,
He holds her helpless breast upon his breast.
How can those terrified vague fingers push
The feathered glory from her loosening thighs?
And how can body, laid in that white rush,
But feel the strange heart beating where it lies?
A shudder in the loins engenders there
The broken wall, the burning roof and tower
And Agamemnon dead.
                    Being so caught up,
So mastered by the brute blood of the air,
Did she put on his knowledge with his power
Before the indifferent beak could let her drop?","The story of Agamemnon, who was killed by a bird of prey. The story is told in the form of a series of short stories by the same name."
To make a prairie (1755),"To make a prairie it takes a clover and one bee,
One clover, and a bee.
And revery.
The revery alone will do,
If bees are few.","To make a prairie it takes a clover and one bee, one clover, and a bee. The revery alone will do, if bees are few."
A Christmas Carol,"In the bleak mid-winter
   Frosty wind made moan,
Earth stood hard as iron,
   Water like a stone;
Snow had fallen, snow on snow,
   Snow on snow,
In the bleak mid-winter 
   Long ago.

Our God, Heaven cannot hold Him
   Nor earth sustain;
Heaven and earth shall flee away
   When He comes to reign:
In the bleak midwinter
   A stable-place sufficed
The Lord God Almighty
   Jesus Christ.

Enough for Him, whom cherubim
   Worship night and day,
A breastful of milk
   And a mangerful of hay;
Enough for Him, whom angels
   Fall down before,
The ox and ass and camel
   Which adore.

Angels and archangels
   May have gathered there,
Cherubim and seraphim
   Thronged the air;
But only His mother
   In her maiden bliss
Worshipped the Beloved
   With a kiss.

What can I give Him,
   Poor as I am?
If I were a shepherd
   I would bring a lamb,
If I were a Wise Man
   I would do my part,—
Yet what I can I give Him,
   Give my heart.",In the bleak mid-winter a stable-place sufficed for the Lord God Almighty. A breastful of milk and a mangerful of hay was enough for Him.
Coherence in Consequence,"Imagine them in black, the morning heat losing within this day that floats. And always there is the being, and the not-seeing on their way to—
The days they approach and their sharpest aches will wrap experience until knowledge is translucent, the frost on which they find themselves slipping. Never mind the loose mindless grip of their forms reflected in the eye-watering hues of the surface, these two will survive in their capacity to meet, to hold the other beneath the plummeting, in the depths below each step full of avoidance. What they create will be held up, will resume: the appetite is bigger than joy. indestructible. for never was it independent from who they are. who will be.

What I Am,"Fred Sanford's on at 12
& I'm standing in the express lane (cash only)
about to buy Head & Shoulders
the white people shampoo, no one knows
what I am. My name could be Lamont.
George Clinton wears colors like Toucan Sam,
the Froot Loop pelican. Follow your nose,
he says. But I have no nose, no mouth,
so you tell me what's good, what's god,
what's funky. When I stop
by McDonalds for a cheeseburger, no one
suspects what I am. I smile at Ronald's poster,
perpetual grin behind the pissed-off, fly-girl
cashier I love. Where are my goddamn fries?
Ain't I American? I never say, Niggaz
in my poems. My ancestors didn't
emigrate. Why would anyone leave
their native land? I'm thinking about shooting
some hoop later on. I'll dunk on everyone
of those niggaz. They have no idea
what I am. I might be the next Jordan
god. They don't know if Toni Morrison
is a woman or a man. Michael Jackson
is the biggest name in showbiz. Mamma se 
Mamma sa mamma ku sa, sang the Bushmen 
in Africa. I'll buy a dimebag after the game, 
me & Jody. He says, Fuck them white people 
at work, Man. He was an All-American 
in high school. He's cool, but he don't know 
what I am, & so what. Fred Sanford's on

We Should Make a Documentary About Spades,"And here is all we’ll need: a card deck, quartets of sun people
Of the sort found in black college dormitories, some vintage
Music, indiscriminate spirits, fried chicken, some paper,

A writing utensil, and a bottomless Saturday. We should explore
The origins of a derogatory word like spade as well as the word
For feeling alone in polite company. And also the implications
Of calling someone who is not your brother or sister,

Brother or Sister. So little is known of our past, we can imagine
Damn near anything. When I say maybe slaves held Spades
Tournaments on the anti-cruise ships bound for the Colonies,
You say when our ancestors were cooped on those ships

They were not yet slaves. Our groundbreaking film should begin
With a low-lit den in the Deep South and the deep fried voice
Of somebody’s grandmother holding smoke in her mouth
As she says, “The two of Diamonds trumps the two of Spades

In my house.” And at some point someone should tell the story
Where Jesus and the devil are Spades partners traveling
The juke joints of the 1930s. We could interview my uncle Junior
And definitely your skinny cousin Mary and any black man

Sitting at a card table wearing shades. Who do you suppose
Would win if Booker T and MLK were matched against Du Bois
And Malcolm X in a game of Spades? You say don’t talk
Across the table. Pay attention to the suits being played.

The object of the game is to communicate invisibly
With your teammate. I should concentrate. Do you suppose
We are here because we are lonely in some acute diasporafied
Way? This should be explored in our film about Spades.

Because it is one of the ways I am still learning what it is
To be black, tonight I am ready to master Spades. Four players
Bid a number of books. Each team adds the bids
Of the two partners, and the total is the number of books

That team must try to win. Is that not right? This is a game
That tests the boundary between mathematics and magic,
If you ask me. A bid must be intuitive like the itchiness
Of the your upper lip before you sip strange whiskey.

My mother did not drink, which is how I knew something
Was wrong with her, but she held a dry spot at the table
When couples came to play. It’s a scene from my history,
But this probably should not be mentioned in our documentary

About Spades. Renege is akin to the word for the shame
You feel watching someone else’s humiliation. Slapping
A card down must be as dramatic as hitting the face of a drum
With your palm, not hitting the face of a drum with a drumstick.

You say there may be the sort of outrage induced
By liquor, trash talk, and poor strategy, but it will fade
The way a watermark left on a table by a cold glass fades.
I suspect winning this sort of game makes you feel godly.

I’m good and ready for who ever we’re playing
Against tonight. I am trying to imagine our enemy.
I know you are not my enemy. You say there are no enemies
In Spades. Spades is a game our enemies do not play.",The origins of a derogatory word like spade as well as the word for feeling alone in polite company should be explored in a new documentary. The film should begin with a low-lit den in the Deep South and the deep fried voice of somebody's grandmother.
Christmas Carol,"   Ring out, ye bells!
   All Nature swells
With gladness at the wondrous story,—
   The world was lorn,
   But Christ is born
To change our sadness into glory.

   Sing, earthlings, sing!
   To-night a King
Hath come from heaven's high throne to bless us.
   The outstretched hand
   O'er all the land
Is raised in pity to caress us.

   Come at his call;
   Be joyful all;
Away with mourning and with sadness!
   The heavenly choir
   With holy fire
Their voices raise in songs of gladness.

   The darkness breaks
   And Dawn awakes,
Her cheeks suffused with youthful blushes.
   The rocks and stones
   In holy tones
Are singing sweeter than the thrushes.

   Then why should we
   In silence be,
When Nature lends her voice to praises;
   When heaven and earth
   Proclaim the truth
Of Him for whom that lone star blazes?

   No, be not still,
   But with a will
Strike all your harps and set them ringing;
   On hill and heath
   Let every breath
Throw all its power into singing!","The book is called ""The Song of Songs"" and is published by Oxford University Press. It is written in the style of the hymn ""The Lord's Prayer"""
The Owl and the Pussy-Cat,"The Owl and the Pussy-Cat went to sea
   In a beautiful pea-green boat:
They took some honey, and plenty of money
   Wrapped up in a five-pound note.
The Owl looked up to the stars above,
   And sang to a small guitar,
""O lovely Pussy, O Pussy, my love,
   What a beautiful Pussy you are,
            You are,
            You are!
   What a beautiful Pussy you are!""
Pussy said to the Owl, ""You elegant fowl,
   How charmingly sweet you sing!
Oh! let us be married; too long we have tarried,
   But what shall we do for a ring?""
They sailed away, for a year and a day,
To the land where the bong-tree grows;
And there in a wood a Piggy-wig stood,
   With a ring at the end of his nose,
            His nose,
            His nose,
   With a ring at the end of his nose.
""Dear Pig, are you willing to sell for one shilling
   Your ring?"" Said the Piggy, ""I will.""
So they took it away, and were married next day
   By the turkey who lives on the hill.
They dined on mince and slices of quince,
   Which they ate with a runcible spoon;
And hand in hand, on the edge of the sand,
   They danced by the light of the moon,
            The moon,
            The moon,
   They danced by the light of the moon.","The Owl and the Pussy-Cat went to sea in a beautiful pea-green boat. They took some honey, and plenty of money wrapped up in a five-pound note. They sailed away, for a year and a day, to the land where the bong-tree grows."
A Visit from St. Nicholas,"'Twas the night before Christmas, when all through the house
Not a creature was stirring, not even a mouse;
The stockings were hung by the chimney with care,
In hopes that St. Nicholas soon would be there;
The children were nestled all snug in their beds,
While visions of sugar-plums danced in their heads;
And mamma in her ’kerchief, and I in my cap,
Had just settled our brains for a long winter’s nap,
When out on the lawn there arose such a clatter,
I sprang from the bed to see what was the matter.
Away to the window I flew like a flash,
Tore open the shutters and threw up the sash.
The moon on the breast of the new-fallen snow
Gave the lustre of mid-day to objects below,
When, what to my wondering eyes should appear,
But a miniature sleigh, and eight tiny reindeer,
With a little old driver, so lively and quick,
I knew in a moment it must be St. Nick.
More rapid than eagles his coursers they came,
And he whistled, and shouted, and called them by name;
""Now, Dasher! now, Dancer! now, Prancer and Vixen!
On, Comet! on, Cupid! on, Donder and Blitzen!
To the top of the porch! to the top of the wall!
Now dash away! dash away! dash away all!""
As dry leaves that before the wild hurricane fly,
When they meet with an obstacle, mount to the sky;
So up to the house-top the coursers they flew,
With the sleigh full of Toys, and St. Nicholas too.
And then, in a twinkling, I heard on the roof
The prancing and pawing of each little hoof.
As I drew in my head, and was turning around,
Down the chimney St. Nicholas came with a bound.
He was dressed all in fur, from his head to his foot,
And his clothes were all tarnished with ashes and soot;
A bundle of Toys he had flung on his back,
And he looked like a pedler just opening his pack.
His eyes—how they twinkled! his dimples how merry!
His cheeks were like roses, his nose like a cherry!
His droll little mouth was drawn up like a bow
And the beard of his chin was as white as the snow;
The stump of a pipe he held tight in his teeth,
And the smoke it encircled his head like a wreath;
He had a broad face and a little round belly,
That shook when he laughed, like a bowlful of jelly.
He was chubby and plump, a right jolly old elf,
And I laughed when I saw him, in spite of myself;
A wink of his eye and a twist of his head,
Soon gave me to know I had nothing to dread;
He spoke not a word, but went straight to his work,
And filled all the stockings; then turned with a jerk,
And laying his finger aside of his nose,
And giving a nod, up the chimney he rose;
He sprang to his sleigh, to his team gave a whistle,
And away they all flew like the down of a thistle,
But I heard him exclaim, ere he drove out of sight,
""Happy Christmas to all, and to all a good-night.""","'Twas the night before Christmas, when all through the house not a creature was stirring, not even a mouse' 'When out on the lawn there arose such a clatter,                I sprang from the bed to see what was the matter' 'And what to my wondering eyes should appear, but a miniature sleigh, and eight tiny reindeer'"
Hurricane,"Four tickets left, I let her go—
Firstborn into a hurricane.

Head is empty of the drowned

Her first breath below sea level.

Your hands from the grown

Alone, all alone

See! on yon drear and rigid bier low lies thy love, Lenore!
Come! let the burial rite be read--the funeral song be sung!--
An anthem for the queenliest dead that ever died so young--
A dirge for her the doubly dead in that she died so young.

Heart to Heart,"It’s neither red
nor sweet.
It doesn’t melt
or turn over,
break or harden,
so it can’t feel
pain,
yearning,
regret.
It doesn’t have

it isn’t even
shapely—
just a thick clutch
of muscle,
lopsided,
mute. Still,
I feel it inside
its cage sounding
a dull tattoo:
I want, I want—
but I can’t open it:
there’s no key.
I can’t wear it
on my sleeve,
or tell you from
the bottom of it
how I feel. Here,
it’s all yours, now—
but you’ll have
to take me,
too.","It doesn’t melt, turn over, break or harden. It’s neither red nor sweet. Still, I feel it inside its cage sounding like a dull tattoo. I want, I want to open it, but I can’n't."
To Autumn,"Season of mists and mellow fruitfulness,
  Close bosom-friend of the maturing sun;
Conspiring with him how to load and bless
  With fruit the vines that round the thatch-eves run;
To bend with apples the moss’d cottage-trees,
  And fill all fruit with ripeness to the core;
    To swell the gourd, and plump the hazel shells
  With a sweet kernel; to set budding more,
And still more, later flowers for the bees,
Until they think warm days will never cease,
    For summer has o’er-brimm’d their clammy cells.
Who hath not seen thee oft amid thy store?
  Sometimes whoever seeks abroad may find
Thee sitting careless on a granary floor,
  Thy hair soft-lifted by the winnowing wind;
Or on a half-reap’d furrow sound asleep,
  Drowsed with the fume of poppies, while thy hook
    Spares the next swath and all its twined flowers:
And sometimes like a gleaner thou dost keep
  Steady thy laden head across a brook;
  Or by a cider-press, with patient look,
    Thou watchest the last oozings, hours by hours.
Where are the songs of Spring? Ay, where are they?
  Think not of them, thou hast thy music too,—
While barred clouds bloom the soft-dying day,
  And touch the stubble-plains with rosy hue;
Then in a wailful choir the small gnats mourn
  Among the river sallows, borne aloft
    Or sinking as the light wind lives or dies;
And full-grown lambs loud bleat from hilly bourn;
  Hedge-crickets sing; and now with treble soft
  The redbreast whistles from a garden-croft,
    And gathering swallows twitter in the skies.","Season of mists and mellow fruitfulness. Close bosom-friend of the maturing sun. The redbreast whistles from a garden-croft, gathering swallows twitter in the skies."
My mistress' eyes are nothing like the sun (Sonnet 130),"My mistress' eyes are nothing like the sun;
Coral is far more red than her lips' red;
If snow be white, why then her breasts are dun;
If hairs be wires, black wires grow on her head.
I have seen roses damasked, red and white,
But no such roses see I in her cheeks;
And in some perfumes is there more delight
Than in the breath that from my mistress reeks.
I love to hear her speak, yet well I know
That music hath a far more pleasing sound;
I grant I never saw a goddess go;
My mistress when she walks treads on the ground.
     And yet, by heaven, I think my love as rare
     As any she belied with false compare.","""My mistress' eyes are nothing like the sun""; ""Her lips are far more red than her lips' red""; ""If snow be white, why then her breasts are dun""; ""I have seen roses damasked, red and white, but no such roses see I in her cheeks""; ""In some perfumes is there more delight than in the breath that from my mistress reeks"""
On Death,"Then Almitra spoke, saying, We would ask now of Death.
    And he said:
    You would know the secret of death.
    But how shall you find it unless you seek it in the heart of life?
    The owl whose night-bound eyes are blind unto the day cannot unveil the mystery of light.
    If you would indeed behold the spirit of death, open your heart wide unto the body of life.
    For life and death are one, even as the river and the sea are one.
    In the depth of your hopes and desires lies your silent knowledge of the beyond;
    And like seeds dreaming beneath the snow your heart dreams of spring.
    Trust the dreams, for in them is hidden the gate to eternity.
    Your fear of death is but the trembling of the shepherd when he stands before the king whose hand is to be laid upon him in honour.
    Is the shepherd not joyful beneath his trembling, that he shall wear the mark of the king?
    Yet is he not more mindful of his trembling?
    For what is it to die but to stand naked in the wind and to melt into the sun?
    And what is it to cease breathing, but to free the breath from its restless tides, that it may rise and expand and seek God unencumbered?
    Only when you drink from the river of silence shall you indeed sing.
    And when you have reached the mountain top, then you shall begin to climb.
    And when the earth shall claim your limbs, then shall you truly dance.","Almitra said: 'If you would indeed behold the spirit of death, open your heart wide unto the body of life' He added: 'For what is it to die but to stand naked in the wind and to melt into the sun?'"
A Prayer for my Daughter,"Once more the storm is howling, and half hid
Under this cradle-hood and coverlid
My child sleeps on. There is no obstacle
But Gregory's wood and one bare hill
Whereby the haystack- and roof-levelling wind,
Bred on the Atlantic, can be stayed;
And for an hour I have walked and prayed
Because of the great gloom that is in my mind.
I have walked and prayed for this young child an hour
And heard the sea-wind scream upon the tower,
And under the arches of the bridge, and scream
In the elms above the flooded stream;
Imagining in excited reverie
That the future years had come,
Dancing to a frenzied drum,
Out of the murderous innocence of the sea.
May she be granted beauty and yet not
Beauty to make a stranger's eye distraught,
Or hers before a looking-glass, for such,
Being made beautiful overmuch,
Consider beauty a sufficient end,
Lose natural kindness and maybe
The heart-revealing intimacy
That chooses right, and never find a friend.
Helen being chosen found life flat and dull
And later had much trouble from a fool,
While that great Queen, that rose out of the spray,
Being fatherless could have her way
Yet chose a bandy-leggèd smith for man.
It's certain that fine women eat
A crazy salad with their meat
Whereby the Horn of Plenty is undone.
In courtesy I'd have her chiefly learned;
Hearts are not had as a gift but hearts are earned
By those that are not entirely beautiful;
Yet many, that have played the fool
For beauty's very self, has charm made wise,
And many a poor man that has roved,
Loved and thought himself beloved,
From a glad kindness cannot take his eyes.
May she become a flourishing hidden tree
That all her thoughts may like the linnet be,
And have no business but dispensing round
Their magnanimities of sound,
Nor but in merriment begin a chase,
Nor but in merriment a quarrel.
O may she live like some green laurel
Rooted in one dear perpetual place.
My mind, because the minds that I have loved,
The sort of beauty that I have approved,
Prosper but little, has dried up of late,
Yet knows that to be choked with hate
May well be of all evil chances chief.
If there's no hatred in a mind
Assault and battery of the wind
Can never tear the linnet from the leaf.
An intellectual hatred is the worst,
So let her think opinions are accursed.
Have I not seen the loveliest woman born
Out of the mouth of Plenty's horn,
Because of her opinionated mind
Barter that horn and every good
By quiet natures understood
For an old bellows full of angry wind?
Considering that, all hatred driven hence,
The soul recovers radical innocence
And learns at last that it is self-delighting,
Self-appeasing, self-affrighting,
And that its own sweet will is Heaven's will;
She can, though every face should scowl
And every windy quarter howl
Or every bellows burst, be happy still.
And may her bridegroom bring her to a house
Where all's accustomed, ceremonious;
For arrogance and hatred are the wares
Peddled in the thoroughfares.
How but in custom and in ceremony
Are innocence and beauty born?
Ceremony's a name for the rich horn,
And custom for the spreading laurel tree.",The poem was written by the French poet Jean-Michel Cousteau. It was written in the early 19th century. The poem is titled 'The Horn of Plenty' and is written in French and English.
Shoulders,"A man crosses the street in rain,
stepping gently, looking two times north and south,
because his son is asleep on his shoulder.
No car must splash him.
No car drive too near to his shadow.
This man carries the world’s most sensitive cargo
but he’s not marked.
Nowhere does his jacket say FRAGILE,
HANDLE WITH CARE.
His ear fills up with breathing.
He hears the hum of a boy’s dream
deep inside him.
We’re not going to be able
to live in this world
if we’re not willing to do what he’s doing
with one another.
The road will only be wide.
The rain will never stop falling.","A man crosses the street in rain, looking two times north and south, because his son is asleep on his shoulder. He hears the hum of a boy's dream deep inside him."
On Marriage,"Then Almitra spoke again and said, And what of Marriage, master?
      And he answered saying:
      You were born together, and together you shall be forevermore.
      You shall be together when the white wings of death scatter your days.
      Ay, you shall be together even in the silent memory of God.
      But let there be spaces in your togetherness,
      And let the winds of the heavens dance between you.
     Love one another, but make not a bond of love:
      Let it rather be a moving sea between the shores of your souls.
      Fill each other’s cup but drink not from one cup.
      Give one another of your bread but eat not from the same loaf.
      Sing and dance together and be joyous, but let each one of your be alone,
      Even as the strings of the lute are alone though they quiver with the same music.
     Give your hearts, but not into each other’s keeping.
      For only the hand of Life can contain your hearts.
      And stand together yet not too near together:
      For the pillars of the temple stand apart,
      And the oak tree and the cypress grow not in each other’s shadow.","Almitra said: 'You were born together, and together you shall be forevermore' 'Let there be spaces in your togetherness, let the winds of the heavens dance between you'"

I Must Become a Menace to My Enemies,"Dedicated to the Poet Agostinho Neto,
President of The People’s Republic of Angola: 1976
1
I will no longer lightly walk behind
a one of you who fear me:
                                     Be afraid.
I plan to give you reasons for your jumpy fits
and facial tics
I will not walk politely on the pavements anymore
and this is dedicated in particular
to those who hear my footsteps
or the insubstantial rattling of my grocery
cart
then turn around
see me
and hurry on
away from this impressive terror I must be:
I plan to blossom bloody on an afternoon
surrounded by my comrades singing
terrible revenge in merciless
accelerating
rhythms
But
I have watched a blind man studying his face.
I have set the table in the evening and sat down
to eat the news.
Regularly
I have gone to sleep.
There is no one to forgive me.
The dead do not give a damn.
I live like a lover
who drops her dime into the phone
just as the subway shakes into the station
wasting her message
canceling the question of her call:
fulminating or forgetful but late
and always after the fact that could save or 
condemn me
I must become the action of my fate.
2
How many of my brothers and my sisters
will they kill
before I teach myself
retaliation?
Shall we pick a number? 
South Africa for instance:
do we agree that more than ten thousand
in less than a year but that less than
five thousand slaughtered in more than six
months will
WHAT IS THE MATTER WITH ME?
I must become a menace to my enemies.
3
And if I 
if I ever let you slide
who should be extirpated from my universe
who should be cauterized from earth
completely
(lawandorder jerkoffs of the first the
                   terrorist degree)
then let my body fail my soul
in its bedeviled lecheries
And if I 
if I ever let love go
because the hatred and the whisperings
become a phantom dictate I o-
bey in lieu of impulse and realities
(the blossoming flamingos of my
                   wild mimosa trees)
then let love freeze me
out.
I must become
I must become a menace to my enemies.","The poem is dedicated to the Poet Agostinho Neto, President of The People’s Republic of Angola in 1976. It is titled: ‘I will no longer lightly walk behind’"

She Walks in Beauty,"I.
She walks in beauty, like the night
Of cloudless climes and starry skies;
And all that’s best of dark and bright
Meet in her aspect and her eyes:
Thus mellowed to that tender light
Which heaven to gaudy day denies.
II.
One shade the more, one ray the less,
Had half impaired the nameless grace
Which waves in every raven tress,
Or softly lightens o’er her face;
Where thoughts serenely sweet express
How pure, how dear their dwelling place.
III.
And on that cheek, and o’er that brow,
So soft, so calm, yet eloquent,
The smiles that win, the tints that glow,
But tell of days in goodness spent,
A mind at peace with all below,
A heart whose love is innocent!","The poem is about a woman who walks in beauty, like the night. The author describes her as ""soft, so calm, yet eloquent, with a heart whose love is innocent!"""
The Heart of the Tree,"What does he plant who plants a tree?
   He plants a friend of sun and sky;
He plants the flag of breezes free;
   The shaft of beauty, towering high;
   He plants a home to heaven anigh;
      For song and mother-croon of bird
      In hushed and happy twilight heard—
The treble of heaven's harmony—
These things he plants who plants a tree.
What does he plant who plants a tree?
   He plants cool shade and tender rain,
And seed and bud of days to be,
   And years that fade and flush again;
      He plants the glory of the plain;
      He plants the forest's heritage;
      The harvest of a coming age;
The joy that unborn eyes shall see—
These things he plants who plants a tree.
What does he plant who plants a tree?
   He plants, in sap and leaf and wood,
In love of home and loyalty
   And far-cast thought of civic good—
   His blessings on the neighborhood,
      Who in the hollow of His hand
      Holds all the growth of all our land—
A nation's growth from sea to sea
Stirs in his heart who plants a tree.","The poem is called ""The Tree of Life"" and is written in the form of a sonnet. It is about a man who plants a tree for the love of home and loyalty."
The Star-Spangled Banner,"O say, can you see, by the dawn's early light,
What so proudly we hailed at the twilight's last gleaming?
Whose broad stripes and bright stars through the perilous fight,
O'er the ramparts we watched were so gallantly streaming;
And the rocket's red glare, the bombs bursting in air,
Gave proof through the night that our flag was still there;
O say, does that star-spangled banner yet wave
O'er the land of the free, and the home of the brave?
On the shore dimly seen through the mists of the deep,
Where the foe's haughty host in dread silence reposes,
What is that which the breeze, o'er the towering steep,
As it fitfully blows, now conceals, now discloses?
Now it catches the gleam of the morning's first beam,
In full glory reflected now shines on the stream;
'Tis the star-spangled banner; O long may it wave
O'er the land of the free, and the home of the brave!
And where is that band who so vauntingly swore
That the havoc of war and the battle's confusion
A home and a country should leave us no more?
Their blood has washed out their foul footsteps' pollution.
No refuge could save the hireling and slave,
From the terror of flight and the gloom of the grave;
And the star-spangled banner in triumph doth wave
O'er the land of the free, and the home of the brave!
O! thus be it ever, when freemen shall stand
Between their loved homes and the war's desolation!
Blest with victory and peace, may the heav'n-rescued land,
Praise the power that hath made and preserved us a nation.
Then conquer we must, for our cause it is just.
And this be our motto— ""In God is our trust; ""
And the star-spangled banner in triumph shall wave
O'er the land of the free, and the home of the brave.","""The Star-spangled Banner"" is a poem by U.S. poet William Butler Yeats. Yeats: ""O long may it wave!"" ""In God is our trust"""
Poetry,"I too, dislike it: there are things that are important beyond all this fiddle.
   Reading it, however, with a perfect contempt for it, one discovers that there is in
   it after all, a place for the genuine.
      Hands that can grasp, eyes
      that can dilate, hair that can rise
         if it must, these things are important not because a
high-sounding interpretation can be put upon them but because they are
   useful; when they become so derivative as to become unintelligible, the
   same thing may be said for all of us—that we
      do not admire what
      we cannot understand. The bat,
         holding on upside down or in quest of something to
eat, elephants pushing, a wild horse taking a roll, a tireless wolf under
   a tree, the immovable critic twinkling his skin like a horse that feels a flea, the base—
   ball fan, the statistician—case after case
      could be cited did
      one wish it; nor is it valid
         to discriminate against “business documents and
school-books”; all these phenomena are important. One must make a distinction
   however: when dragged into prominence by half poets, the result is not poetry,
   nor till the autocrats among us can be
     “literalists of
      the imagination”—above
         insolence and triviality and can present
for inspection, imaginary gardens with real toads in them, shall we have
   it. In the meantime, if you demand on the one hand, in defiance of their opinion—
   the raw material of poetry in
      all its rawness, and
      that which is on the other hand,
         genuine, then you are interested in poetry.","Poetry is not poetry, but the raw material of poetry in all its rawness. The bat, elephants pushing, a wild horse taking a roll, a tireless wolf under a tree are important."
American History,"Those four black girls blown up
in that Alabama church
remind me of five hundred
middle passage blacks,
in a net, under water
in Charleston harbor
so redcoats wouldn't find them.
Can't find what you can't see
can you?","Those four black girls blown up in Alabama remind me of five hundred black passage blacks,                in a net, under water                in Charleston harbor. Can't find what you can't see                can you?"
The Shield of Achilles,"    She looked over his shoulder
       For vines and olive trees,
    Marble well-governed cities
       And ships upon untamed seas,
    But there on the shining metal
       His hands had put instead
    An artificial wilderness
       And a sky like lead.
A plain without a feature, bare and brown,
   No blade of grass, no sign of neighborhood,
Nothing to eat and nowhere to sit down,
   Yet, congregated on its blankness, stood
   An unintelligible multitude,
A million eyes, a million boots in line,
Without expression, waiting for a sign.
Out of the air a voice without a face
   Proved by statistics that some cause was just
In tones as dry and level as the place:
   No one was cheered and nothing was discussed;
   Column by column in a cloud of dust
They marched away enduring a belief
Whose logic brought them, somewhere else, to grief.
    She looked over his shoulder
       For ritual pieties,
    White flower-garlanded heifers,
       Libation and sacrifice,
    But there on the shining metal
       Where the altar should have been,
    She saw by his flickering forge-light
       Quite another scene.
Barbed wire enclosed an arbitrary spot
   Where bored officials lounged (one cracked a joke)
And sentries sweated for the day was hot:
   A crowd of ordinary decent folk
   Watched from without and neither moved nor spoke
As three pale figures were led forth and bound
To three posts driven upright in the ground.
The mass and majesty of this world, all
   That carries weight and always weighs the same
Lay in the hands of others; they were small
   And could not hope for help and no help came:
   What their foes liked to do was done, their shame
Was all the worst could wish; they lost their pride
And died as men before their bodies died.
    She looked over his shoulder
       For athletes at their games,
    Men and women in a dance
       Moving their sweet limbs
    Quick, quick, to music,
       But there on the shining shield
    His hands had set no dancing-floor
       But a weed-choked field.
A ragged urchin, aimless and alone,
   Loitered about that vacancy; a bird
Flew up to safety from his well-aimed stone:
   That girls are raped, that two boys knife a third,
   Were axioms to him, who'd never heard
Of any world where promises were kept,
Or one could weep because another wept.
    The thin-lipped armorer,
       Hephaestos, hobbled away,
    Thetis of the shining breasts
       Cried out in dismay
    At what the god had wrought
       To please her son, the strong
    Iron-hearted man-slaying Achilles
       Who would not live long.","She looked over his shoulder for vines and olive trees, marble well-governed cities, ships upon untamed seas, and flower-garlanded heifers. But there on the shining metal she saw an artificial wilderness, a sky like lead, and a plain without a feature."
Ode to My Socks,"Maru Mori brought me
a pair
of socks
which she knitted herself
with her sheepherder’s hands,
two socks as soft
as rabbits.
I slipped my feet
into them
as though into
two
cases
knitted
with threads of
twilight
and goatskin.
Violent socks,
my feet were
two fish made
of wool,
two long sharks
sea-blue, shot
through
by one golden thread,
two immense blackbirds,
two cannons:
my feet
were honored
in this way
by
these
heavenly
socks.
They were
so handsome
for the first time
my feet seemed to me
unacceptable
like two decrepit
firemen, firemen
unworthy
of that woven
fire,
of those glowing
socks.
Nevertheless
I resisted
the sharp temptation
to save them somewhere
as schoolboys
keep
fireflies,
as learned men
collect
sacred texts,
I resisted
the mad impulse
to put them
into a golden
cage
and each day give them
birdseed
and pieces of pink melon.
Like explorers
in the jungle who hand
over the very rare
green deer
to the spit
and eat it
with remorse,
I stretched out
my feet
and pulled on
the magnificent
socks
and then my shoes.
The moral
of my ode is this:
beauty is twice
beauty
and what is good is doubly
good
when it is a matter of two socks
made of wool
in winter.","Maru Mori brought me a pair of socks that she knitted herself with her sheepherder’s hands. The socks were made of wool and goatskin and were as soft as rabbits. For the first time, my feet seemed to me unacceptable."
Gate A-4,"Wandering around the Albuquerque Airport Terminal, after learning
my flight had been delayed four hours, I heard an announcement:
""If anyone in the vicinity of Gate A-4 understands any Arabic, please
come to the gate immediately.""
Well—one pauses these days. Gate A-4 was my own gate. I went there.
An older woman in full traditional Palestinian embroidered dress, just
like my grandma wore, was crumpled to the floor, wailing. ""Help,""
said the flight agent. ""Talk to her. What is her problem? We
told her the flight was going to be late and she did this.""
I stooped to put my arm around the woman and spoke haltingly.
""Shu-dow-a, Shu-bid-uck Habibti? Stani schway, Min fadlick, Shu-bit-
se-wee?"" The minute she heard any words she knew, however poorly
used, she stopped crying. She thought the flight had been cancelled
entirely. She needed to be in El Paso for major medical treatment the
next day. I said, ""No, we're fine, you'll get there, just later, who is
picking you up? Let's call him.""
We called her son, I spoke with him in English. I told him I would
stay with his mother till we got on the plane and ride next to
her. She talked to him. Then we called her other sons just
for the fun of it. Then we called my dad and he and she spoke for a while
in Arabic and found out of course they had ten shared friends. Then I
thought just for the heck of it why not call some Palestinian poets I know
and let them chat with her? This all took up two hours.
She was laughing a lot by then. Telling of her life, patting my knee,
answering questions. She had pulled a sack of homemade mamool
cookies—little powdered sugar crumbly mounds stuffed with dates and
nuts—from her bag—and was offering them to all the women at the gate.
To my amazement, not a single woman declined one. It was like a
sacrament. The traveler from Argentina, the mom from California, the
lovely woman from Laredo—we were all covered with the same powdered
sugar. And smiling. There is no better cookie.
And then the airline broke out free apple juice from huge coolers and two
little girls from our flight ran around serving it and they
were covered with powdered sugar, too. And I noticed my new best friend—
by now we were holding hands—had a potted plant poking out of her bag,
some medicinal thing, with green furry leaves. Such an old country tradi-
tion. Always carry a plant. Always stay rooted to somewhere.
And I looked around that gate of late and weary ones and I thought, This
is the world I want to live in. The shared world. Not a single person in that
gate—once the crying of confusion stopped—seemed apprehensive about
any other person. They took the cookies. I wanted to hug all those other women, too.
This can still happen anywhere. Not everything is lost.","The author's flight from Albuquerque to El Paso, Texas, was delayed four hours. A woman at Gate A-4 was wailing in Arabic, but when she spoke to her, she stopped crying. The woman offered cookies to all the women at the gate, and not a single woman declined."

The Village Blacksmith,"Under a spreading chestnut-tree
     ⁠The village smithy stands;
The smith, a mighty man is he,
     With large and sinewy hands,
And the muscles of his brawny arms
     Are strong as iron bands.
His hair is crisp, and black, and long;
     His face is like the tan;
His brow is wet with honest sweat,
     He earns whate'er he can,
And looks the whole world in the face,
     For he owes not any man.
Week in, week out, from morn till night,
     You can hear his bellows blow;
You can hear him swing his heavy sledge,
     With measured beat and slow,
Like a sexton ringing the village bell,
     When the evening sun is low.
And children coming home from school
     Look in at the open door;
They love to see the flaming forge,
     And hear the bellows roar,
And catch the burning sparks that fly
     Like chaff from a threshing-floor.
He goes on Sunday to the church,
     And sits among his boys;
He hears the parson pray and preach,
     He hears his daughter's voice
Singing in the village choir,
     And it makes his heart rejoice.
It sounds to him like her mother's voice
     Singing in Paradise!
He needs must think of her once more,
     How in the grave she lies;
And with his hard, rough hand he wipes
     A tear out of his eyes.
Toiling,—rejoicing,—sorrowing,
     Onward through life he goes;
Each morning sees some task begin,
     Each evening sees it close;
Something attempted, something done,
     Has earned a night's repose.
Thanks, thanks to thee, my worthy friend,
     For the lesson thou hast taught!
Thus at the flaming forge of life
     Our fortunes must be wrought;
Thus on its sounding anvil shaped
     Each burning deed and thought.","The village smithy stands under a spreading chestnut-tree. The smith is a mighty man, with large and sinewy hands, strong as iron bands. He earns whate'er he can, and owes not any man."
[I wandered lonely as a Cloud],"I wandered lonely as a Cloud
   That floats on high o’er Vales and Hills,
When all at once I saw a crowd,
   A host of golden Daffodils;
Beside the Lake, beneath the trees,
Fluttering and dancing in the breeze.
Continuous as the stars that shine
   And twinkle on the Milky Way,
They stretched in never-ending line
   Along the margin of a bay:
Ten thousand saw I at a glance,
Tossing their heads in sprightly dance.
The waves beside them danced, but they
   Out-did the sparkling waves in glee:—
A Poet could not but be gay
   In such a jocund company:
I gazed—and gazed—but little thought
What wealth the shew to me had brought:
For oft when on my couch I lie
   In vacant or in pensive mood,
They flash upon that inward eye
   Which is the bliss of solitude,
And then my heart with pleasure fills,
And dances with the Daffodils.",The poem was written in the first half of the 20th century. It is about a man who is lonely in the world. He is surrounded by a crowd of Daffodils.
I taste a liquor never brewed (214),"I taste a liquor never brewed – 
From Tankards scooped in Pearl – 
Not all the Frankfort Berries
Yield such an Alcohol!
Inebriate of air – am I – 
And Debauchee of Dew – 
Reeling – thro' endless summer days – 
From inns of molten Blue – 
When ""Landlords"" turn the drunken Bee
Out of the Foxglove's door – 
When Butterflies – renounce their ""drams"" – 
I shall but drink the more!
Till Seraphs swing their snowy Hats – 
And Saints – to windows run –

Dulce et Decorum Est,"Bent double, like old beggars under sacks,
Knock-kneed, coughing like hags, we cursed through sludge,
Till on the haunting flares we turned our backs
And towards our distant rest began to trudge.
Men marched asleep. Many had lost their boots
But limped on, blood-shod. All went lame; all blind;
Drunk with fatigue; deaf even to the hoots
Of tired, outstripped Five-Nines that dropped behind.
Gas! Gas! Quick, boys!—An ecstasy of fumbling,
Fitting the clumsy helmets just in time;
But someone still was yelling out and stumbling
And flound'ring like a man in fire or lime...
Dim, through the misty panes and thick green light,
As under a green sea, I saw him drowning.
In all my dreams, before my helpless sight,
He plunges at me, guttering, choking, drowning.
If in some smothering dreams you too could pace
Behind the wagon that we flung him in,
And watch the white eyes writhing in his face,
His hanging face, like a devil's sick of sin;
If you could hear, at every jolt, the blood
Come gargling from the froth-corrupted lungs,
Obscene as cancer, bitter as the cud
Of vile, incurable sores on innocent tongues,—
My friend, you would not tell with such high zest
To children ardent for some desperate glory,
The old Lie: Dulce et decorum est
Pro patria mori.","Men marched asleep. Many had lost their boots. All went lame; all blind; drunk with fatigue; deaf even to the hoots of tired, outstripped Five-Nines that dropped behind. The old Lie: Dulce et decorum estPro patria mori."
For the Fallen,"With proud thanksgiving, a mother for her children,
England mourns for her dead across the sea.
Flesh of her flesh they were, spirit of her spirit,
Fallen in the cause of the free.
Solemn the drums thrill: Death august and royal
Sings sorrow up into immortal spheres.
There is a music in the midst of desolation
And a glory that shines upon our tears.
They went with songs to the battle, they were young,
Straight of limb, true of eye, steady and aglow.
They were staunch to the end against odds uncountered:
They fell with their faces to the foe.
They shall grow not old, as we that are left grow old:
Age shall not weary them, nor the years condemn.
At the going down of the sun and in the morning
We will remember them.
They mingle not with their laughing comrades again;
They sit no more at familiar tables at home;
They have no lot in our labour of the day-time;
They sleep beyond England's foam.
But where our desires are and our hopes profound,
Felt as a well-spring that is hidden from sight,
To the innermost heart of their own land they are known
As the stars are known to the Night;
As the stars that shall be bright when we are dust,
Moving in marches upon the heavenly plain;
As the stars are starry in the time of our darkness,
To the end, to the end they remain.","England mourns for her dead across the sea. With proud thanksgiving, a mother for her children, England mourns. They went with songs to the battle, they were young, straight of limb, true of eye, steady and aglow."
Not to Keep,"They sent him back to her. The letter came
Saying... and she could have him. And before
She could be sure there was no hidden ill
Under the formal writing, he was in her sight—
Living.— They gave him back to her alive—
How else? They are not known to send the dead—
And not disfigured visibly. His face?—
His hands? She had to look—to ask,
“What was it, dear?” And she had given all
And still she had all—they had—they the lucky!
Wasn’t she glad now? Everything seemed won,
And all the rest for them permissible ease.
She had to ask, ""What was it, dear?""
                                                               “Enough,
Yet not enough. A bullet through and through,
High in the breast. Nothing but what good care
And medicine and rest—and you a week,
Can cure me of to go again.” The same
Grim giving to do over for them both.
She dared no more than ask him with her eyes
How was it with him for a second trial.
And with his eyes he asked her not to ask.
They had given him back to her, but not to keep. ","They sent him back to her. The letter came saying... and she could have him. She had to ask, ""What was it, dear?"""
"The Canterbury Tales, “The Nun’s Priest’s Tale” [Excerpt]","This Chanticleer stood high upon his toes,
Stretching his neck, and both his eyes did close,
And so did crow right loudly, for the nonce;
And Russel Fox, he started up at once,
And by the gorget grabbed our Chanticleer,
Flung him on back, and toward the wood did steer,
For there was no man who as yet pursued.
O destiny, you cannot be eschewed!
Alas, that Chanticleer flew from the beams!
Alas, his wife recked nothing of his dreams!
     This simple widow and her daughters two
Heard these hens cry and make so great ado,
And out of doors they started on the run
And saw the fox into the grove just gone,
Bearing in his mouth the cock away.
And then they cried, “Alas, and weladay!
Oh, the fox!” and after him they ran,
And after them, with staves, went many a man;
Ran Coll, our dog, and Talbot and Garland,
Ran cow and calf and even the very hogs,
So were they scared by barking of the dogs
And shouting men and women all did make,
They all ran so they thought their hearts would break.
And now, good men, I pray you hearken all.
     Behold how Fortune turns all suddenly
The hope and pride of even her enemy!
This cock, which now lay in the fox’s mouth,
In all his fear unto the fox did clack
And say: “Sir, were I you, as I should be,
Then would I say (as God may now help me!),
‘Turn back again, presumptuous peasants all!
A very pestilence upon you fall!
Now that I've gained here to this dark wood’s side,
In spite of you this cock shall here abide.
I’ll eat him, by my faith, and that anon!’”
The fox replied: “In faith, it shall be done!”
And as he spoke that word, all suddenly
This cock broke from his mouth, full cleverly,
And high upon a tree he flew anon.
And when the fox saw well that he was gone,
“Alas,” quoth he, “O Chanticleer, alas!
I have against you done a base trespass
Inasmuch as I made you afeared
When I seized you and brought you from the yard;
But, sir, I did it with no foul intent;
Come down, and I will tell you what I meant.
I’ll tell the truth to you, God help me so!
“Nay then,” said he, “beshrew us both, you know,
But first, beshrew myself, both blood and bones,
If you beguile me, having done so once,
You shall no more, with any flattery,
Cause me to sing and closeup either eye;
For he who shuts his eyes when he should see,
And wilfully, God let him ne’er be free!”
“Nay,” said the fox, “but God give him mischance
Who is so indiscreet in governance
He chatters when he ought to hold his peace.”
     But you that hold this tale a foolery,
As but about a fox, a cock, a hen,
Yet do not miss the moral, my good men.
For Saint Paul says that all that's written well
Is written down some useful truth to tell.
Then take the wheat and let the chaff lie still.
     And now, good God, and if it be Thy will,
As says Lord Christ, so make us all good men
And bring us into His high bliss. Amen.","The story of Russel Fox is told in the story of a fox and a cock. The fox grabs the cock from his mouth and flies off with it in his mouth. The cock crows after the fox, saying: “I’ll eat him, by my faith, and that anon!"""
The Creation,"And God stepped out on space,
And he looked around and said:
I'm lonely—
I'll make me a world.
And far as the eye of God could see
Darkness covered everything,
Blacker than a hundred midnights
Down in a cypress swamp.
Then God smiled,
And the light broke,
And the darkness rolled up on one side,
And the light stood shining on the other,
And God said: That's good!
Then God reached out and took the light in his hands,
And God rolled the light around in his hands
Until he made the sun;
And he set that sun a-blazing in the heavens.
And the light that was left from making the sun
God gathered it up in a shining ball
And flung it against the darkness,
Spangling the night with the moon and stars.
Then down between
The darkness and the light
He hurled the world;
And God said: That's good!
Then God himself stepped down—
And the sun was on his right hand,
And the moon was on his left;
The stars were clustered about his head,
And the earth was under his feet.
And God walked, and where he trod
His footsteps hollowed the valleys out
And bulged the mountains up.
Then he stopped and looked and saw
That the earth was hot and barren.
So God stepped over to the edge of the world
And he spat out the seven seas—
He batted his eyes, and the lightnings flashed—
He clapped his hands, and the thunders rolled—
And the waters above the earth came down,
The cooling waters came down.
Then the green grass sprouted,
And the little red flowers blossomed,
The pine tree pointed his finger to the sky,
And the oak spread out his arms,
The lakes cuddled down in the hollows of the ground,
And the rivers ran down to the sea;
And God smiled again,
And the rainbow appeared,
And curled itself around his shoulder.
Then God raised his arm and he waved his hand
Over the sea and over the land,
And he said: Bring forth! Bring forth!
And quicker than God could drop his hand,
Fishes and fowls
And beasts and birds
Swam the rivers and the seas,
Roamed the forests and the woods,
And split the air with their wings.
And God said: That's good!
Then God walked around,
And God looked around
On all that he had made.
He looked at his sun,
And he looked at his moon,
And he looked at his little stars;
He looked on his world
With all its living things,
And God said: I'm lonely still.
Then God sat down—
On the side of a hill where he could think;
By a deep, wide river he sat down;
With his head in his hands,
God thought and thought,
Till he thought: I'll make me a man!
Up from the bed of the river
God scooped the clay;
And by the bank of the river
He kneeled him down;
And there the great God Almighty
Who lit the sun and fixed it in the sky,
Who flung the stars to the most far corner of the night,
Who rounded the earth in the middle of his hand;
This great God,
Like a mammy bending over her baby,
Kneeled down in the dust
Toiling over a lump of clay
Till he shaped it in is his own image;
Then into it he blew the breath of life,
And man became a living soul.
Amen.      Amen.","God said: ""I'll make me a world. And God stepped out on space, and he looked around and said: I'm lonely"" God made the sun, the moon, the stars, and the earth. He hurled the world into space."
Dream Song 1,"Huffy Henry hid    the day,
unappeasable Henry sulked.
I see his point,—a trying to put things over.
It was the thought that they thought
they could do it made Henry wicked & away.
But he should have come out and talked.
All the world like a woolen lover
once did seem on Henry's side.
Then came a departure.
Thereafter nothing fell out as it might or ought.
I don't see how Henry, pried
open for all the world to see, survived.
What he has now to say is a long
wonder the world can bear & be.
Once in a sycamore I was glad
all at the top, and I sang.
Hard on the land wears the strong sea
and empty grows every bed.","Huffy Henry hid    the day, the unappeasable Henry sulked. The thought that they thought they could do it made Henry wicked & away."

My Heart Leaps Up,"My heart leaps up when I behold 
   A rainbow in the sky:
So was it when my life began; 
So is it now I am a man; 
So be it when I shall grow old, 
   Or let me die!
The Child is father of the Man;
And I could wish my days to be
Bound each to each by natural piety.

"I, Too","I, too, sing America.
I am the darker brother.
They send me to eat in the kitchen
When company comes,
But I laugh,
And eat well,
And grow strong.
Tomorrow,
I'll be at the table
When company comes.
Nobody'll dare
Say to me,
“Eat in the kitchen,”
Then.
Besides,
They'll see how beautiful I am
And be ashamed—
I, too, am America.","I am the darker brother. They send me to eat in the kitchen when company comes. But I laugh, and eat well, and grow strong. I, too, sing America."
A Far Cry from Africa,"A wind is ruffling the tawny pelt
Of Africa. Kikuyu, quick as flies,
Batten upon the bloodstreams of the veldt.
Corpses are scattered through a paradise.
Only the worm, colonel of carrion, cries:
""Waste no compassion on these separate dead!""
Statistics justify and scholars seize
The salients of colonial policy.
What is that to the white child hacked in bed?
To savages, expendable as Jews?
Threshed out by beaters, the long rushes break
In a white dust of ibises whose cries
Have wheeled since civilization's dawn
From the parched river or beast-teeming plain.
The violence of beast on beast is read
As natural law, but upright man
Seeks his divinity by inflicting pain.
Delirious as these worried beasts, his wars
Dance to the tightened carcass of a drum,
While he calls courage still that native dread
Of the white peace contracted by the dead.
Again brutish necessity wipes its hands
Upon the napkin of a dirty cause, again
A waste of our compassion, as with Spain,
The gorilla wrestles with the superman.
I who am poisoned with the blood of both,
Where shall I turn, divided to the vein?
I who have cursed
The drunken officer of British rule, how choose
Between this Africa and the English tongue I love?
Betray them both, or give back what they give?
How can I face such slaughter and be cool?
How can I turn from Africa and live?","The gorilla wrestles with the superman. The violence of beast on beast is read as natural law, but upright man inflict pain by inflicting pain. The drunken officer of British rule, how choose between this Africa and the English tongue I love, or give back what they give?"
There Will Come Soft Rains,"(War Time)
There will come soft rains and the smell of the ground,
And swallows circling with their shimmering sound;
And frogs in the pools singing at night,
And wild plum trees in tremulous white,
Robins will wear their feathery fire
Whistling their whims on a low fence-wire;
And not one will know of the war, not one
Will care at last when it is done.
Not one would mind, neither bird nor tree
If mankind perished utterly;
And Spring herself, when she woke at dawn,
Would scarcely know that we were gone.","There will come soft rains and the smell of the ground, swallows circling with their shimmering sound, frogs in the pools singing at night, wild plum trees in tremulous white. Not one will know of the war, not one will care at last when it is done."
"somewhere i have never travelled,gladly beyond","somewhere i have never travelled, gladly beyond
any experience, your eyes have their silence:
in your most frail gesture are things which enclose me,
or which i cannot touch because they are too near
your slightest look easily will unclose me
though i have closed myself as fingers,
you open always petal by petal myself as Spring opens
(touching skillfully, mysteriously) her first rose
or if your wish be to close me, i and
my life will shut very beautifully, suddenly,
as when the heart of this flower imagines
the snow carefully everywhere descending;
nothing which we are to perceive in this world equals
the power of your intense fragility: whose texture
compels me with the colour of its countries,
rendering death and forever with each breathing
(i do not know what it is about you that closes
and opens; only something in me understands
the voice of your eyes is deeper than all roses)
nobody, not even the rain, has such small hands","""If your wish be to close me, i and my life will shut very beautifully, suddenly, suddenly"" ""The voice of your eyes is deeper than all roses"" ""You open always petal by petal myself as Spring opens"""
Hope is the thing with feathers (254),"Hope is the thing with feathers
That perches in the soul,
And sings the tune without the words,
And never stops at all,
And sweetest in the gale is heard;
And sore must be the storm
That could abash the little bird
That kept so many warm.
I've heard it in the chillest land,
And on the strangest sea;
Yet, never, in extremity,
It asked a crumb of me.","Hope is the thing with feathers that perches in the soul, and sings the tune without the words. I've heard it in the chillest land,                And on the strangest sea;                Yet, never, in extremity, has it asked a crumb of me."
Remember,"Remember the sky that you were born under,
know each of the star’s stories.
Remember the moon, know who she is.
Remember the sun’s birth at dawn, that is the
strongest point of time. Remember sundown
and the giving away to night.
Remember your birth, how your mother struggled
to give you form and breath. You are evidence of
her life, and her mother’s, and hers.
Remember your father. He is your life, also.
Remember the earth whose skin you are:
red earth, black earth, yellow earth, white earth
brown earth, we are earth.
Remember the plants, trees, animal life who all have their
tribes, their families, their histories, too. Talk to them,
listen to them. They are alive poems.
Remember the wind. Remember her voice. She knows the
origin of this universe.
Remember you are all people and all people
are you.
Remember you are this universe and this
universe is you.
Remember all is in motion, is growing, is you.
Remember language comes from this.
Remember the dance language is, that life is.

Diving into the Wreck,"First having read the book of myths,
and loaded the camera,
and checked the edge of the knife-blade,
I put on
the body-armor of black rubber
the absurd flippers
the grave and awkward mask.
I am having to do this
not like Cousteau with his
assiduous team
aboard the sun-flooded schooner
but here alone.
There is a ladder.
The ladder is always there
hanging innocently
close to the side of the schooner.
We know what it is for,
we who have used it.
Otherwise
it is a piece of maritime floss
some sundry equipment.
I go down.
Rung after rung and still
the oxygen immerses me
the blue light
the clear atoms
of our human air.
I go down.
My flippers cripple me,
I crawl like an insect down the ladder
and there is no one
to tell me when the ocean
will begin.
First the air is blue and then
it is bluer and then green and then
black I am blacking out and yet
my mask is powerful
it pumps my blood with power
the sea is another story
the sea is not a question of power
I have to learn alone
to turn my body without force
in the deep element.
And now: it is easy to forget
what I came for
among so many who have always
lived here
swaying their crenellated fans
between the reefs
and besides
you breathe differently down here.
I came to explore the wreck.
The words are purposes.
The words are maps.
I came to see the damage that was done
and the treasures that prevail.
I stroke the beam of my lamp
slowly along the flank
of something more permanent
than fish or weed
the thing I came for:
the wreck and not the story of the wreck
the thing itself and not the myth
the drowned face always staring
toward the sun
the evidence of damage
worn by salt and sway into this threadbare beauty
the ribs of the disaster
curving their assertion
among the tentative haunters.
This is the place.
And I am here, the mermaid whose dark hair
streams black, the merman in his armored body.
We circle silently
about the wreck
we dive into the hold.
I am she: I am he
whose drowned face sleeps with open eyes
whose breasts still bear the stress
whose silver, copper, vermeil cargo lies
obscurely inside barrels
half-wedged and left to rot
we are the half-destroyed instruments
that once held to a course
the water-eaten log
the fouled compass
We are, I am, you are
by cowardice or courage
the one who find our way
back to this scene
carrying a knife, a camera
a book of myths
in which
our names do not appear.","""I came to explore the wreck. I came to see the damage that was done and the treasures that prevail"" ""I am here, the mermaid whose dark hairstreams black, the merman in his armored body"""
A Time to Talk,"When a friend calls to me from the road
And slows his horse to a meaning walk,
I don’t stand still and look around
On all the hills I haven’t hoed,
And shout from where I am, What is it?
No, not as there is a time to talk.
I thrust my hoe in the mellow ground,
Blade-end up and five feet tall,
And plod: I go up to the stone wall
For a friendly visit.","When a friend calls to me from the road, I don't stand still and look around. I thrust my hoe in the mellow ground,Blade-end up and five feet tall,And plod: I go up to the stone wall."
On Pain,"And a woman spoke, saying, Tell us of Pain.
     And he said:
     Your pain is the breaking of the shell that encloses your understanding.
     Even as the stone of the fruit must break, that its heart may stand in the sun, so must you know pain.
     And could you keep your heart in wonder at the daily miracles of your life your pain would not seem less wondrous than your joy;
     And you would accept the seasons of your heart, even as you have always accepted the seasons that pass over your fields.
     And you would watch with serenity through the winters of your grief.

     Much of your pain is self-chosen.
     It is the bitter potion by which the physician within you heals your sick self.
     Therefore trust the physician, and drink his remedy in silence and tranquility:
     For his hand, though heavy and hard, is guided by the tender hand of the Unseen,
     And the cup he brings, though it burn your lips, has been fashioned of the clay which the Potter has moistened with His own sacred tears. ",Pain is the breaking of the shell that encloses your understanding. Much of your pain is self-chosen. It is the bitter potion by which the physician within you heals your sick self.
"In the chemo room, I wear mittens made of ice so I don’t lose my fingernails. But I took a risk today to write this down.","Whenever I spend the day crying, 
my friends tell me I look high. Good grief,  
they finally understand me.  
Even when the arena is empty, I thank god  
for the shots I miss. If you ever catch me

remind me I’m not thanking god. Remind me  
all my prayers were answered

I know how to build a survival shelter  
from fallen tree branches, packed mud,  
and pulled moss. I could survive forever  
on death alone. Wasn’t it death that taught me  
to stop measuring my lifespan by length,
but by width? Do you know how many beautiful things  
can be seen in a single second? How you can blow up
a second like a balloon and fit infinity inside of it? 
I’m infinite, I know, but I still have a measly wrinkle
collection compared to my end goal. I would love  
to be a before picture, I think, as I look in the mirror
and mistake my head for the moon. My dark  
thoughts are almost always 238,856 miles away 
from me believing them. I love this life, 
I whisper into my doctor’s stethoscope

I didn’t inherit until I thought I could die.
Why did I go so long believing I owed the world
my disappointment? Why did I want to take
the world by storm when I could have taken it
by sunshine, by rosewater, by the cactus flowers
on the side of the road where I broke down?
I’m not about to waste more time
spinning stories about how much time
I’m owed, but there is a man
who is usually here, who isn’t today.  
I don’t know if he’s still alive. I just know
his wife was made of so much hope  
she looked like a firework above his chair.
Will the afterlife be harder if I remember
the people I love, or forget them?

Trees,"I think that I shall never see
A poem lovely as a tree.
A tree whose hungry mouth is prest
Against the earth's sweet flowing breast;
A tree that looks at God all day,
And lifts her leafy arms to pray;
A tree that may in summer wear
A nest of robins in her hair;
Upon whose bosom snow has lain;
Who intimately lives with rain.
Poems are made by fools like me,
But only God can make a tree.","A tree that may in summer wear a nest of robins in her hair. A tree that looks at God all day, and lifts her leafy arms to pray."
On the Pulse of Morning,"A Rock, A River, A Tree
Hosts to species long since departed,
Marked the mastodon,
The dinosaur, who left dried tokens
Of their sojourn here
On our planet floor,
Any broad alarm of their hastening doom
Is lost in the gloom of dust and ages.
But today, the Rock cries out to us, clearly, forcefully,
Come, you may stand upon my
Back and face your distant destiny,
But seek no haven in my shadow.
I will give you no hiding place down here.
You, created only a little lower than
The angels, have crouched too long in
The bruising darkness
Have lain too long
Face down in ignorance.
Your mouths spilling words
Armed for slaughter.
The Rock cries out to us today, you may stand upon me,
But do not hide your face.
Across the wall of the world,
A River sings a beautiful song. It says,
Come, rest here by my side.
Each of you, a bordered country,
Delicate and strangely made proud,
Yet thrusting perpetually under siege.
Your armed struggles for profit
Have left collars of waste upon
My shore, currents of debris upon my breast.
Yet today I call you to my riverside,
If you will study war no more. Come,
Clad in peace, and I will sing the songs
The Creator gave to me when I and the
Tree and the rock were one.
Before cynicism was a bloody sear across your
Brow and when you yet knew you still
Knew nothing.
The River sang and sings on.
There is a true yearning to respond to
The singing River and the wise Rock.
So say the Asian, the Hispanic, the Jew
The African, the Native American, the Sioux,
The Catholic, the Muslim, the French, the Greek
The Irish, the Rabbi, the Priest, the Sheik,
The Gay, the Straight, the Preacher,
The privileged, the homeless, the Teacher.
They hear. They all hear
The speaking of the Tree.
They hear the first and last of every Tree
Speak to humankind today. Come to me, here beside the River.
Plant yourself beside the River.
Each of you, descendant of some passed
On traveller, has been paid for.
You, who gave me my first name, you,
Pawnee, Apache, Seneca, you
Cherokee Nation, who rested with me, then
Forced on bloody feet,
Left me to the employment of
Other seekers—desperate for gain,
Starving for gold.
You, the Turk, the Arab, the Swede, the German, the Eskimo, the Scot,
You the Ashanti, the Yoruba, the Kru, bought,
Sold, stolen, arriving on the nightmare
Praying for a dream.
Here, root yourselves beside me.
I am that Tree planted by the River,
Which will not be moved.
I, the Rock, I the River, I the Tree
I am yours—your passages have been paid.
Lift up your faces, you have a piercing need
For this bright morning dawning for you.
History, despite its wrenching pain
Cannot be unlived, but if faced
With courage, need not be lived again.
Lift up your eyes upon
This day breaking for you.
Give birth again
To the dream.
Women, children, men,
Take it into the palms of your hands,
Mold it into the shape of your most
Private need. Sculpt it into
The image of your most public self.
Lift up your hearts
Each new hour holds new chances
For a new beginning.
Do not be wedded forever
To fear, yoked eternally
To brutishness.
The horizon leans forward,
Offering you space to place new steps of change.
Here, on the pulse of this fine day
You may have the courage
To look up and out and upon me, the
Rock, the River, the Tree, your country.
No less to Midas than the mendicant.
No less to you now than the mastodon then.
Here, on the pulse of this new day
You may have the grace to look up and out
And into your sister’s eyes, and into
Your brother’s face, your country
And say simply
Very simply
With hope—
Good morning.","A Rock, A River, A Tree, hosts species long since departed, including the mastodon. The Rock cries out to us today, you may stand upon me, but do not hide your face. The River sings a beautiful song."
Good Bones,"Life is short, though I keep this from my children.
Life is short, and I’ve shortened mine
in a thousand delicious, ill-advised ways,
a thousand deliciously ill-advised ways
I’ll keep from my children. The world is at least
fifty percent terrible, and that’s a conservative
estimate, though I keep this from my children.
For every bird there is a stone thrown at a bird.
For every loved child, a child broken, bagged,
sunk in a lake. Life is short and the world
is at least half terrible, and for every kind
stranger, there is one who would break you,
though I keep this from my children. I am trying
to sell them the world. Any decent realtor,
walking you through a real shithole, chirps on
about good bones: This place could be beautiful,
right? You could make this place beautiful.","Life is short, and I’ve shortened mine in a thousand delicious, ill-advised ways. The world is at least half terrible, and for every kind of stranger, there is one who would break you. I am trying to sell them the world."
So we'll go no more a roving,"So, we'll go no more a roving
    So late into the night,
Though the heart be still as loving,
    And the moon be still as bright.

For the sword outwears its sheath,
    And the soul wears out the breast,
And the heart must pause to breathe,
    And love itself have rest.

Though the night was made for loving,
    And the day returns too soon,
Yet we'll go no more a roving

To the Sea,"Sometimes when you start to ramble
or rather when you feel you are starting to ramble
you will say Well, now I’m rambling
though I don’t think you ever are.
And if you ever are I don’t really care.
And not just because I and everyone really 
at times falls into our own unspooling
—which really I think is a beautiful softness
of being human, trying to show someone else
the color of all our threads, wanting another to know 
everything in us we are trying to show them—
but in the specific, 
in the specific of you
here in this car that you are driving
and in which I am sitting beside you
with regards to you 
and your specific mouth
parting to give way
to the specific sweetness that is
the water of your voice 
tumbling forth—like I said 
I don’t ever really mind
how much more 
you might keep speaking
as it simply means 
I get to hear you 
speak for longer. 
What was a stream 
now a river.","I don’t ever really mind how much more  hypertrophicyou might keep speaking, as it simply means I get to hear you speak for longer. The water of your voice is a beautiful softness of being human."
Enough,"You are enough
Divinity flows in your fingertips
        with light so radiant

a victory march
made of whole universes
        stitched by the hands of creation

Fields of wildflowers in your prayers
        Lighthouses in your eyes
    No one else can see it for you

You will always be enough
Your simple act of being is enough

The Soul has Bandaged moments (360),"The Soul has Bandaged moments –
When too appalled to stir –
She feels some ghastly Fright come up
And stop to look at her –
Salute her, with long fingers –
Caress her freezing hair –
Sip, Goblin, from the very lips
The Lover – hovered – o’er –
Unworthy, that a thought so mean
Accost a Theme – so – fair ­–
The soul has moments of escape –
When bursting all the doors –
She dances like a Bomb, abroad,
And swings opon the Hours,
As do the Bee – delirious borne –
Long Dungeoned from his Rose –
Touch Liberty – then know no more,
But Noon, and Paradise –
The Soul’s retaken moments –
When, Felon led along,
With shackles on the plumed feet,
And staples, in the song,
The Horror welcomes her, again,
These, are not brayed of Tongue –","The Soul has Bandaged moments – when too appalled to stir – when some ghastly Fright come up. The Lover – hovered – o’er – unworthy, that a thought so mean could be so mean."
Fern Hill,"Now as I was young and easy under the apple boughs
About the lilting house and happy as the grass was green,
     The night above the dingle starry,
          Time let me hail and climb
     Golden in the heydays of his eyes,
And honoured among wagons I was prince of the apple towns
And once below a time I lordly had the trees and leaves
          Trail with daisies and barley
     Down the rivers of the windfall light.
And as I was green and carefree, famous among the barns
About the happy yard and singing as the farm was home,
     In the sun that is young once only,
          Time let me play and be
     Golden in the mercy of his means,
And green and golden I was huntsman and herdsman, the calves
Sang to my horn, the foxes on the hills barked clear and cold,
          And the sabbath rang slowly
     In the pebbles of the holy streams.
All the sun long it was running, it was lovely, the hay
Fields high as the house, the tunes from the chimneys, it was air
     And playing, lovely and watery
          And fire green as grass.
     And nightly under the simple stars
As I rode to sleep the owls were bearing the farm away,
All the moon long I heard, blessed among stables, the nightjars
     Flying with the ricks, and the horses
          Flashing into the dark.
And then to awake, and the farm, like a wanderer white
With the dew, come back, the cock on his shoulder: it was all
     Shining, it was Adam and maiden,
          The sky gathered again
     And the sun grew round that very day.
So it must have been after the birth of the simple light
In the first, spinning place, the spellbound horses walking warm
     Out of the whinnying green stable
          On to the fields of praise.
And honoured among foxes and pheasants by the gay house
Under the new made clouds and happy as the heart was long,
     In the sun born over and over,
          I ran my heedless ways,
     My wishes raced through the house high hay
And nothing I cared, at my sky blue trades, that time allows
In all his tuneful turning so few and such morning songs
     Before the children green and golden
          Follow him out of grace,
Nothing I cared, in the lamb white days, that time would take me
Up to the swallow thronged loft by the shadow of my hand,
     In the moon that is always rising,
          Nor that riding to sleep
     I should hear him fly with the high fields
And wake to the farm forever fled from the childless land.
Oh as I was young and easy in the mercy of his means,
          Time held me green and dying
     Though I sang in my chains like the sea.","As I was young and easy under the apple boughs and happy as the grass was green, I was a huntsman and herdsman. The foxes on the hills barked clear and cold, and the sabbath rang slowly in the pebbles."

Tea at the Palaz of Hoon,"Not less because in purple I descended
The western day through what you called
The loneliest air, not less was I myself.

What was the ointment sprinkled on my beard?
What were the hymns that buzzed beside my ears?
What was the sea whose tide swept through me there?

Out of my mind the golden ointment rained,
And my ears made the blowing hymns they heard.
I was myself the compass of that sea:

I was the world in which I walked, and what I saw
Or heard or felt came not but from myself;
And there I found myself more truly and more strange.",In purple I descended through the western day through what you called 'the loneliest air' Not less was I myself. I was myself the compass of that sea. What I saw or heard or felt came not but from myself.
The Unknown Citizen,"(To JS/07 M 378
This Marble Monument
Is Erected by the State)
He was found by the Bureau of Statistics to be
One against whom there was no official complaint,
And all the reports on his conduct agree
That, in the modern sense of an old-fashioned word, he was a saint,
For in everything he did he served the Greater Community.
Except for the War till the day he retired
He worked in a factory and never got fired,
But satisfied his employers, Fudge Motors Inc.
Yet he wasn't a scab or odd in his views,
For his Union reports that he paid his dues,
(Our report on his Union shows it was sound)
And our Social Psychology workers found
That he was popular with his mates and liked a drink.
The Press are convinced that he bought a paper every day
And that his reactions to advertisements were normal in every way.
Policies taken out in his name prove that he was fully insured,
And his Health-card shows he was once in hospital but left it cured.
Both Producers Research and High-Grade Living declare
He was fully sensible to the advantages of the Instalment Plan
And had everything necessary to the Modern Man,
A phonograph, a radio, a car and a frigidaire.
Our researchers into Public Opinion are content
That he held the proper opinions for the time of year;
When there was peace, he was for peace: when there was war, he went.
He was married and added five children to the population,
Which our Eugenist says was the right number for a parent of his generation.
And our teachers report that he never interfered with their education.
Was he free? Was he happy? The question is absurd:
Had anything been wrong, we should certainly have heard.","He was found by the Bureau of Statistics to be one against whom there was no official complaint. He worked in a factory and never got fired, satisfied his employers, Fudge Motors Inc."
Love is Not All (Sonnet XXX),"Love is not all: it is not meat nor drink
Nor slumber nor a roof against the rain; 
Nor yet a floating spar to men that sink 
And rise and sink and rise and sink again; 
Love can not fill the thickened lung with breath, 
Nor clean the blood, nor set the fractured bone; 
Yet many a man is making friends with death 
Even as I speak, for lack of love alone. 
It well may be that in a difficult hour, 
Pinned down by pain and moaning for release, 
Or nagged by want past resolution’s power, 
I might be driven to sell your love for peace, 
Or trade the memory of this night for food. 
It well may be. I do not think I would. ","Love is not all: it is not meat nor drink nor slumber nor a roof against the rain. Love can not fill the thickened lung with breath, nor clean the blood, nor set the fractured bone. Many a man is making friends with death, for lack of love alone."
What the Living Do,"Johnny, the kitchen sink has been clogged for days, some utensil probably fell down there.
And the Drano won’t work but smells dangerous, and the crusty dishes have piled up
waiting for the plumber I still haven’t called. This is the everyday we spoke of.
It’s winter again: the sky’s a deep, headstrong blue, and the sunlight pours through
the open living-room windows because the heat’s on too high in here and I can’t turn it off.
For weeks now, driving, or dropping a bag of groceries in the street, the bag breaking,
I’ve been thinking: This is what the living do. And yesterday, hurrying along those
wobbly bricks in the Cambridge sidewalk, spilling my coffee down my wrist and sleeve,
I thought it again, and again later, when buying a hairbrush: This is it.
Parking. Slamming the car door shut in the cold. What you called that yearning.
What you finally gave up. We want the spring to come and the winter to pass. We want
whoever to call or not call, a letter, a kiss—we want more and more and then more of it.
But there are moments, walking, when I catch a glimpse of myself in the window glass,
say, the window of the corner video store, and I'm gripped by a cherishing so deep
for my own blowing hair, chapped face, and unbuttoned coat that I’m speechless:
I am living. I remember you.","This is the everyday we spoke of. Johnny, the kitchen sink has been clogged for days, some utensil probably fell down there.

Annabel Lee,"It was many and many a year ago,
   In a kingdom by the sea,
That a maiden there lived whom you may know
   By the name of Annabel Lee;
And this maiden she lived with no other thought
   Than to love and be loved by me.
I was a child and she was a child,
   In this kingdom by the sea:
But we loved with a love that was more than love—
   I and my Annabel Lee;
With a love that the winged seraphs of heaven
   Coveted her and me.
And this was the reason that, long ago,
   In this kingdom by the sea,
A wind blew out of a cloud, chilling
   My beautiful Annabel Lee;
So that her highborn kinsman came
   And bore her away from me,
To shut her up in a sepulchre
   In this kingdom by the sea.
The angels, not half so happy in heaven,
   Went envying her and me—
Yes!—that was the reason (as all men know,
   In this kingdom by the sea)
That the wind came out of the cloud by night,
   Chilling and killing my Annabel Lee.
But our love it was stronger by far than the love
   Of those who were older than we—
   Of many far wiser than we—
And neither the angels in heaven above,
   Nor the demons down under the sea,
Can ever dissever my soul from the soul
   Of the beautiful Annabel Lee:
For the moon never beams, without bringing me dreams
   Of the beautiful Annabel Lee;
And the stars never rise, but I feel the bright eyes
   Of the beautiful Annabel Lee;
And so, all the night-tide, I lie down by the side
Of my darling—my darling—my life and my bride,
   In her sepulchre there by the sea,
   In her tomb by the sounding sea.","A year ago, in a kingdom by the sea, a maiden there lived whom you may know by the name of Annabel Lee. She lived with no other thought than to love and be loved by me. The angels, not half so happy in heaven, went envying her and me."

And there's one more—that's seventeen,
And don't you think my face looks green?

It might be instamatic flu.

but we recollect emotion
with the speed of the feed.
We pose to show
the spontaneous overflow
of powerful feelings.
There are no more countrysides.
There are no more churchyards.
We smudge our vistas.
We flip the cam around.
What is burning in our little hearts?
Hashtags of interiority
licking like flames.
We had been reflective.
We have been reflected.",We write our poems. We write our manifestos. We peer and cross. We flip the cam around. We think: if only my camera could see me now.
O Captain! My Captain!,"O Captain! my Captain! our fearful trip is done,
The ship has weather’d every rack, the prize we sought is won,
The port is near, the bells I hear, the people all exulting,
While follow eyes the steady keel, the vessel grim and daring;
       But O heart! heart! heart!
         O the bleeding drops of red,
           Where on the deck my Captain lies,
             Fallen cold and dead.
O Captain! my Captain! rise up and hear the bells;
Rise up- for you the flag is flung- for you the bugle trills,
For you bouquets and ribbon’d wreaths- for you the shores a-crowding,
For you they call, the swaying mass, their eager faces turning;
       Here Captain! dear father!
         This arm beneath your head!
           It is some dream that on the deck,
             You’ve fallen cold and dead.
My Captain does not answer, his lips are pale and still,
My father does not feel my arm, he has no pulse nor will,
The ship is anchor’d safe and sound, its voyage closed and done,
From fearful trip the victor ship comes in with object won;
       Exult O shores, and ring O bells!
         But I with mournful tread,
           Walk the deck my Captain lies,
             Fallen cold and dead.","The ship has weather’d every rack, the prize we sought is won, the port is near, the bells I hear, the people all exulting. O Captain! my Captain! our fearful trip is done, the bleeding drops of red, O the bleeding Drops of Red."

"Julius Caesar, Act III, Scene I [O, pardon me, thou bleeding piece of earth]","Antony speaks over Caesar's body

O, pardon me, thou bleeding piece of earth,
That I am meek and gentle with these butchers!
Thou art the ruins of the noblest man
That ever lived in the tide of times.
Woe to the hand that shed this costly blood!
Over thy wounds now do I prophesy,—
Which, like dumb mouths, do ope their ruby lips,
To beg the voice and utterance of my tongue—
A curse shall light upon the limbs of men;
Domestic fury and fierce civil strife
Shall cumber all the parts of Italy;
Blood and destruction shall be so in use
And dreadful objects so familiar
That mothers shall but smile when they behold
Their infants quarter'd with the hands of war;
All pity choked with custom of fell deeds:
And Caesar's spirit, ranging for revenge,
With Ate by his side come hot from hell,
Shall in these confines with a monarch's voice
Cry 'Havoc,' and let slip the dogs of war;
That this foul deed shall smell above the earth
With carrion men, groaning for burial.","Antony speaks over Caesar's body. Antony: ""O, pardon me, thou bleeding piece of earth, that I am meek and gentle with these butchers!"""
The Kraken,"Below the thunders of the upper deep,
Far, far beneath in the abysmal sea,
His ancient, dreamless, uninvaded sleep
The Kraken sleepeth: faintest sunlights flee
About his shadowy sides; above him swell
Huge sponges of millennial growth and height;
And far away into the sickly light,
From many a wondrous grot and secret cell
Unnumbered and enormous polypi
Winnow with giant arms the slumbering green.
There hath he lain for ages, and will lie
Battening upon huge sea worms in his sleep,
Until the latter fire shall heat the deep;
Then once by man and angels to be seen,
In roaring he shall rise and on the surface die.","The Kraken sleeps in an ancient, dreamless, uninvaded sleep. He will lie battling upon huge sea worms in his sleep, until the latter fire shall heat the deep. Then he will rise and on the surface die."
The Anactoria Poem,"Some say thronging cavalry, some say foot soldiers, 
others call a fleet the most beautiful of 
sights the dark earth offers, but I say it's what-
            ever you love best.

And it's easy to make this understood by 
everyone, for she who surpassed all human 
kind in beauty, Helen, abandoning her
            husband—that best of

men—went sailing off to the shores of Troy and 
never spent a thought on her child or loving 
parents: when the goddess seduced her wits and
            left her to wander,

she forgot them all, she could not remember 
anything but longing, and lightly straying 
aside, lost her way. But that reminds me
            now: Anactória,

she's not here, and I'd rather see her lovely 
step, her sparkling glance and her face than gaze on
all the troops in Lydia in their chariots and
            glittering armor.","Helen, abandoning her husband, went sailing off to the shores of Troy and never spent a thought on her child or loving parents. When the goddess seduced her wits and left her to wander, she forgot them all, she could not remember anything but longing."

They throw in Drummer Hodge, to rest
     Uncoffined—just as found:
His landmark is a kopje-crest

And foreign constellations west
     Each night above his mound.

Young Hodge the Drummer never knew—
     Fresh from his Wessex home—
The meaning of the broad Karoo,
     The Bush, the dusty loam,
And why uprose to nightly view
     Strange stars amid the gloam.

Yet portion of that unknown plain
     Will Hodge for ever be;
His homely Northern breast and brain
     Grow up a Southern tree,
And strange-eyed constellations reign

Epitaph to a Dog,"Near this Spot
are deposited the Remains of one
who possessed Beauty without Vanity,
Strength without Insolence,
Courage without Ferosity,
and all the virtues of Man without his Vices.
This praise, which would be unmeaning Flattery
if inscribed over human Ashes,
is but a just tribute to the Memory of
BOATSWAIN, a DOG,
who was born in Newfoundland May 1803
and died at Newstead Nov. 18th, 1808.
When some proud Son of Man returns to Earth,
Unknown to Glory but upheld by Birth,
The sculptor's art exhausts the pomp of woe,
And storied urns record who rests below:
When all is done, upon the Tomb is seen
Not what he was, but what he should have been.
But the poor Dog, in life the firmest friend,
The first to welcome, foremost to defend,
Whose honest heart is still his Master's own,
Who labours, fights, lives, breathes for him alone,
Unhonour'd falls, unnotic'd all his worth,
Deny'd in heaven the Soul he held on earth:
While man, vain insect! hopes to be forgiven,
And claims himself a sole exclusive heaven.
Oh man! thou feeble tenant of an hour,
Debas'd by slavery, or corrupt by power,
Who knows thee well, must quit thee with disgust,
Degraded mass of animated dust!
Thy love is lust, thy friendship all a cheat,
Thy tongue hypocrisy, thy heart deceit!
By nature vile, ennobled but by name,
Each kindred brute might bid thee blush for shame.
Ye! who behold perchance this simple urn,
Pass on, it honors none you wish to mourn.
To mark a friend's remains these stones arise;
I never knew but one—and here he lies.","Near this Spot are deposited the Remains of one who possessed Beauty without Vanity,Strength without Insolence,Courage without Ferosity, and all the virtues of Man without his Vices.

"The Aeneid, Book I, [Arms and the man I sing]","Arms and the man I sing, who, forced by fate
And haughty Juno's unrelenting hate,
Expelled and exiled, left the Trojan shore.
Long labors, both by sea and land, he bore;
And in the doubtful war, before he won
The Latin realm and built the destined town,
His banished gods restored to rights divine,
And settled sure succession in his line;
From whence the race of Alban fathers come,
And the long glories of majestic Rome.
     O Muse! the causes and the crimes relate,—
What goddess was provok'd, and whence her hate;
For what offense the Queen of Heav'n began
To persecute so brave, so just a man;
Involv'd his anxious life in endless cares,
Expos'd to wants, and hurried into wars!
Can heav'nly minds such high resentment show,
Or exercise their spite in human woe?
     Against the Tiber's mouth, but far away,
An ancient town was seated on the sea,—
A Tyrian colony; the people made
Stout for the war, and studious of their trade:
Carthage the name; belov'd by Juno more
Than her own Argos, or the Samian shore.
Here stood her chariot; here, if Heav'n were kind,
The seat of awful empire she design'd.
Yet she had heard an ancient rumor fly,
(Long cited by the people of the sky,)
That times to come should see the Trojan race
Her Carthage ruin, and her tow'rs deface;
Nor thus confin'd, the yoke of sov'reign sway
Should on the necks of all the nations lay.
She ponder'd this, and fear'd it was in fate;
Nor could forget the war she wag'd of late
For conqu'ring Greece against the Trojan state.
Besides, long causes working in her mind,
And secret seeds of envy, lay behind;
Deep graven in her heart the doom remain'd
Of partial Paris, and her form disdain'd;
The grace bestow'd on ravish'd Ganymed,
Electra's glories, and her injur'd bed.
Each was a cause alone; and all combin'd
To kindle vengeance in her haughty mind.
For this, far distant from the Latian coast
She drove the remnants of the Trojan host;
And sev'n long years th' unhappy wand'ring train
Were toss'd by storms, and scatter'd thro' the main.
Such time, such toil, requir'd the Roman name,
Such length of labor for so vast a frame.
     Now scarce the Trojan fleet with sails and oars
Had left behind the fair Sicilian shores,
Entering with cheerful shouts the watery reign,
And plowing frothy furrows in the main,
When, laboring still, with endless discontent
The Queen of Heaven did thus her fury vent:—
     ""Then am I vanquished? must I yield?"" said she,
""And must the Trojans reign in Italy?""
So Fate will have it, and Jove adds his force;
Nor can my power divert their happy course.
Could angry Pallas, with revengeful spleen,
The Grecian navy burn and drown the men?
She, for the fault of one offending foe,
The bolts of Jove himself presumed to throw;
With whirlwinds from beneath she tossed the ship
And bare exposed the bosom of the deep:
Then, as an eagle gripes the trembling game,
The wretch , yet hissing with her father's flame,
She strongly seized, and with a burning wound,
Transfixed and naked, on a rock she bound.
But I, who walked in awful state above,
The majesty of heaven, the sister-wife of Jove,
For length of years my fruitless force employ
Against the thin remains of ruined Troy.
What nations now to Juno's power will pray,
Or offerings on  my slighted altars lay?""","The Queen of Heaven did thus her fury vent:  ""Then am I vanquished? must I yield?"" said she, ""And must the Trojans reign in Italy?"" ""For what offense the Queen of Heav'n began,"" she said."
Blues,"I am lazy, the laziest
girl in the world. I sleep during
the day when I want to, 'til
my face is creased and swollen,
'til my lips are dry and hot. I 
eat as I please: cookies and milk
after lunch, butter and sour cream
on my baked potato, foods that
slothful people eat, that turn
yellow and opaque beneath the skin.
Sometimes come dinnertime Sunday
I am still in my nightgown, the one
with the lace trim listing because
I have not mended it. Many days
I do not exercise, only
consider it, then rub my curdy
belly and lie down. Even
my poems are lazy. I use
syllabics instead of iambs,
prefer slant to the gong of full rhyme,
write briefly while others go
for pages. And yesterday,
for example, I did not work at all!
I got in my car and I drove 
to factory outlet stores, purchased
stockings and panties and socks
with my father's money.

To think, in childhood I missed only
one day of school per year. I went
to ballet class four days a week
at four-forty-five and on
Saturdays, beginning always
with plie, ending with curtsy.
To think, I knew only industry,
the industry of my race
and of immigrants, the radio
tuned always to the station
that said, Line up your summer
job months in advance. Work hard
and do not shame your family,
who worked hard to give you what you have.
There is no sin but sloth. Burn
to a wick and keep moving.

I avoided sleep for years,
up at night replaying 
evening news stories about
nearby jailbreaks, fat people
who ate fried chicken and woke up
dead. In sleep I am looking
for poems in the shape of open
V's of birds flying in formation,
or open arms saying, I forgive you, all.","I am lazy, the laziest girl in the world. I sleep during the day when I want to, 'til my face is creased and swollen.

The Naming of Cats,"The Naming of Cats is a difficult matter,
     It isn’t just one of your holiday games;
You may think at first I’m as mad as a hatter
When I tell you, a cat must have THREE DIFFERENT NAMES.
First of all, there’s the name that the family use daily,
     Such as Peter, Augustus, Alonzo, or James,
Such as Victor or Jonathan, George or Bill Bailey—
     All of them sensible everyday names.
There are fancier names if you think they sound sweeter,
     Some for the gentlemen, some for the dames:
Such as Plato, Admetus, Electra, Demeter—
     But all of them sensible everyday names,
But I tell you, a cat needs a name that’s particular,
     A name that’s peculiar, and more dignified,
Else how can he keep up his tail perpendicular,
     Or spread out his whiskers, or cherish his pride?
Of names of this kind, I can give you a quorum,
     Such as Munkustrap, Quaxo, or Coricopat,
Such as Bombalurina, or else Jellylorum—
     Names that never belong to more than one cat.
But above and beyond there’s still one name left over,
     And that is the name that you never will guess;
The name that no human research can discover—
     But THE CAT HIMSELF KNOWS, and will never confess.
When you notice a cat in profound meditation,
     The reason, I tell you, is always the same:
His mind is engaged in a rapt contemplation
     Of the thought, of the thought, of the thought of his name:
          His ineffable effable
          Effanineffable
Deep and inscrutable singular name.","The Naming of Cats is a difficult matter. A cat needs a name that’s particular, peculiar, and more dignified. The name that you never will guess is the name that no human research can discover."
Dreams,"Hold fast to dreams 
For if dreams die
Life is a broken-winged bird
That cannot fly.
Hold fast to dreams
For when dreams go
Life is a barren field
Frozen with snow.","Life is a broken-winged bird that cannot fly. Hold fast to dreams. For when dreams go, life is a barren field with snow."
Dead Stars,"Out here, there’s a bowing even the trees are doing.
                 Winter’s icy hand at the back of all of us.
Black bark, slick yellow leaves, a kind of stillness that feels
so mute it’s almost in another year.
I am a hearth of spiders these days: a nest of trying.
We point out the stars that make Orion as we take out
       the trash, the rolling containers a song of suburban thunder.
It’s almost romantic as we adjust the waxy blue
       recycling bin until you say, Man, we should really learn
some new constellations.
And it’s true. We keep forgetting about Antlia, Centaurus,
       Draco, Lacerta, Hydra, Lyra, Lynx.
But mostly we’re forgetting we’re dead stars too, my mouth is full
       of dust and I wish to reclaim the rising—
to lean in the spotlight of streetlight with you, toward
       what’s larger within us, toward how we were born.
Look, we are not unspectacular things.
       We’ve come this far, survived this much. What
would happen if we decided to survive more? To love harder?
What if we stood up with our synapses and flesh and said, No.
     No, to the rising tides.
Stood for the many mute mouths of the sea, of the land?
What would happen if we used our bodies to bargain
for the safety of others, for earth,
                 if we declared a clean night, if we stopped being terrified,
if we launched our demands into the sky, made ourselves so big
people could point to us with the arrows they make in their minds,
rolling their trash bins out, after all of this is over?",The author has been writing about his life in New York City. He says he is a hearth of spiders these days and wants to reclaim the rising. He asks: What would happen if we decided to survive more?
The City in the Sea,"Lo! Death has reared himself a throne
In a strange city lying alone
Far down within the dim West,
Where the good and the bad and the worst and the best
Have gone to their eternal rest.
There shrines and palaces and towers
(Time-eaten towers and tremble not!)
Resemble nothing that is ours.
Around, by lifting winds forgot,
Resignedly beneath the sky
The melancholy waters lie.
No rays from the holy Heaven come down
On the long night-time of that town;
But light from out the lurid sea
Streams up the turrets silently—
Gleams up the pinnacles far and free—
Up domes—up spires—up kingly halls—
Up fanes—up Babylon-like walls—
Up shadowy long-forgotten bowers
Of sculptured ivy and stone flowers—
Up many and many a marvellous shrine
Whose wreathed friezes intertwine
The viol, the violet, and the vine.
Resignedly beneath the sky
The melancholy waters lie.
So blend the turrets and shadows there
That all seem pendulous in air,
While from a proud tower in the town
Death looks gigantically down.
There open fanes and gaping graves
Yawn level with the luminous waves;
But not the riches there that lie
In each idol’s diamond eye—
Not the gaily-jewelled dead
Tempt the waters from their bed;
For no ripples curl, alas!
Along that wilderness of glass—
No swellings tell that winds may be
Upon some far-off happier sea—
No heavings hint that winds have been
On seas less hideously serene.
But lo, a stir is in the air!
The wave—there is a movement there!
As if the towers had thrust aside,
In slightly sinking, the dull tide—
As if their tops had feebly given
A void within the filmy Heaven.
The waves have now a redder glow—
The hours are breathing faint and low—
And when, amid no earthly moans,
Down, down that town shall settle hence,
Hell, rising from a thousand thrones,
Shall do it reverence.","In a strange city lying alone, Death has reared himself a throne. The good and the bad and the worst and the best have gone to their eternal rest. The melancholy waters lie beneath the sky."
Eldorado,"         Gaily bedight,
         A gallant knight,
     In sunshine and in shadow,
         Had journeyed long,
         Singing a song,
     In search of Eldorado.

         But he grew old—
         This knight so bold—
     And o’er his heart a shadow
         Fell, as he found
         No spot of ground
     That looked like Eldorado.

         And, as his strength
         Failed him at length,
     He met a pilgrim shadow—
         ‘Shadow,’ said he,
         ‘Where can it be—
     This land of Eldorado?’ 

         ‘Over the Mountains
         Of the Moon,
     Down the Valley of the Shadow,
         Ride, boldly ride,’ 
         The shade replied,—
     ‘If you seek for Eldorado!’ ","A gallant knight had journeyed long in search of Eldorado. He met a pilgrim shadow who told him: ‘Where can it be?’ ‘Ride, boldly ride,’ the shade replied."
Scaffolding,"Masons, when they start upon a building,
Are careful to test out the scaffolding;
Make sure that planks won’t slip at busy points,
Secure all ladders, tighten bolted joints.
And yet all this comes down when the job’s done
Showing off walls of sure and solid stone.
So if, my dear, there sometimes seem to be
Old bridges breaking between you and me
Never fear. We may let the scaffolds fall
Confident that we have built our wall.","Masons, when they start upon a building, are careful to test out the scaffolding.Secure all ladders, tighten bolted joints. And yet all this comes down when the job’s done."
"Song of Myself, V","I believe in you my soul, the other I am must not abase itself to you,
And you must not be abased to the other.
Loafe with me on the grass,  loose the stop from your throat,
Not words, not music or rhyme I want, not custom or lecture, not even the best,
Only the lull I like, the hum of your valvèd voice.
I mind how once we lay such a transparent summer morning, 
How you settled your head athwart my hips and gently turn'd over upon me,
And parted the shirt from my bosom-bone, and plunged your tongue to my bare-stript heart,
And reach'd till you felt my beard, and reach'd till you held my feet.
Swiftly arose and spread around me the peace and knowledge that pass all the argument of the earth,
And I know that the hand of God is the promise of my own,
And I know that the spirit of God is the brother of my own,
And that all the men ever born are also my brothers,  and the women my sisters and lovers,

A Poison Tree,"I was angry with my friend:
I told my wrath, my wrath did end.
I was angry with my foe:
I told it not, my wrath did grow.
And I watered it in fears
Night and morning with my tears,
And I sunned it with smiles
And with soft deceitful wiles.
And it grew both day and night,
Till it bore an apple bright,
And my foe beheld it shine,
And he knew that it was mine,--
And into my garden stole
When the night had veiled the pole;
In the morning, glad, I see
My foe outstretched beneath the tree.","""I told my wrath, my wrath did end. I was angry with my friend"" ""I watered it in fears,"" he says. ""I sunned it with smiles and with soft deceitful wiles"""
In Memory of W. B. Yeats,"I
He disappeared in the dead of winter:
The brooks were frozen, the airports almost deserted,
And snow disfigured the public statues;
The mercury sank in the mouth of the dying day.
What instruments we have agree
The day of his death was a dark cold day.
Far from his illness
The wolves ran on through the evergreen forests,
The peasant river was untempted by the fashionable quays;
By mourning tongues
The death of the poet was kept from his poems.
But for him it was his last afternoon as himself,
An afternoon of nurses and rumours;
The provinces of his body revolted,
The squares of his mind were empty,
Silence invaded the suburbs,
The current of his feeling failed; he became his admirers.
Now he is scattered among a hundred cities
And wholly given over to unfamiliar affections,
To find his happiness in another kind of wood
And be punished under a foreign code of conscience.
The words of a dead man
Are modified in the guts of the living.
But in the importance and noise of to-morrow
When the brokers are roaring like beasts on the floor of the bourse,
And the poor have the sufferings to which they are fairly accustomed
And each in the cell of himself is almost convinced of his freedom
A few thousand will think of this day
As one thinks of a day when one did something slightly unusual.
What instruments we have agree
The day of his death was a dark cold day.
  II
You were silly like us; your gift survived it all:
The parish of rich women, physical decay,
Yourself. Mad Ireland hurt you into poetry.
Now Ireland has her madness and her weather still,
For poetry makes nothing happen: it survives
In the valley of its making where executives
Would never want to tamper, flows on south
From ranches of isolation and the busy griefs,
Raw towns that we believe and die in; it survives,
A way of happening, a mouth.
  III
Earth, receive an honoured guest:
William Yeats is laid to rest.
Let the Irish vessel lie
Emptied of its poetry.
In the nightmare of the dark
All the dogs of Europe bark,
And the living nations wait,
Each sequestered in its hate;
Intellectual disgrace
Stares from every human face,
And the seas of pity lie
Locked and frozen in each eye.
Follow, poet, follow right
To the bottom of the night,
With your unconstraining voice
Still persuade us to rejoice;
With the farming of a verse
Make a vineyard of the curse,
Sing of human unsuccess
In a rapture of distress;
In the deserts of the heart
Let the healing fountain start,
In the prison of his days
Teach the free man how to praise.",The poet died in the dead of winter. His death was kept from his poems. The words of a dead man are modified in the guts of the living. A few thousand will think of this day when one did something unusual.
And death shall have no dominion,"And death shall have no dominion.
Dead men naked they shall be one
With the man in the wind and the west moon;
When their bones are picked clean and the clean bones gone,
They shall have stars at elbow and foot;
Though they go mad they shall be sane,
Though they sink through the sea they shall rise again;
Though lovers be lost love shall not;
And death shall have no dominion.
And death shall have no dominion.
Under the windings of the sea
They lying long shall not die windily;
Twisting on racks when sinews give way,
Strapped to a wheel, yet they shall not break;
Faith in their hands shall snap in two,
And the unicorn evils run them through;
Split all ends up they shan't crack;
And death shall have no dominion.
And death shall have no dominion.
No more may gulls cry at their ears
Or waves break loud on the seashores;
Where blew a flower may a flower no more
Lift its head to the blows of the rain;
Though they be mad and dead as nails,
Heads of the characters hammer through daisies;
Break in the sun till the sun breaks down,
And death shall have no dominion.","""Though they go mad they shall be sane,Though they sink through the sea they shall rise again. And death shall have no dominion"""
When We Two Parted,"When we two parted
   In silence and tears,
Half broken-hearted
   To sever for years,
Pale grew thy cheek and cold,
   Colder thy kiss;
Truly that hour foretold
   Sorrow to this.
The dew of the morning
   Sunk chill on my brow— 
It felt like the warning
   Of what I feel now.
Thy vows are all broken,
   And light is thy fame;
I hear thy name spoken,
   And share in its shame.
They name thee before me,
   A knell to mine ear;
A shudder comes o'er me—
   Why wert thou so dear?
They know not I knew thee,
   Who knew thee too well—
Long, long shall I rue thee,
   Too deeply to tell.
In secret we met—
   In silence I grieve,
That thy heart could forget,
   Thy spirit deceive.
If I should meet thee
   After long years,
How should I greet thee?—
   With silence and tears.","When we two parted                   In silence and tears, half broken-hearted                 To sever for years,                Pale grew thy cheek and cold,                 Colder thy kiss;                Truly that hour foretold   Sorrow to this."
The Myth of Innocence,"One summer she goes into the field as usual
stopping for a bit at the pool where she often
looks at herself, to see
if she detects any changes. She sees
the same person, the horrible mantle
of daughterliness still clinging to her.

The sun seems, in the water, very close.
That's my uncle spying again, she thinks—
everything in nature is in some way her relative.
I am never alone, she thinks,
turning the thought into a prayer.
Then death appears, like the answer to a prayer.

No one understands anymore
how beautiful he was. But Persephone remembers.
Also that he embraced her, right there,
with her uncle watching. She remembers
sunlight flashing on his bare arms.

This is the last moment she remembers clearly.
Then the dark god bore her away.

She also remembers, less clearly,
the chilling insight that from this moment
she couldn't live without him again.

The girl who disappears from the pool
will never return. A woman will return,
looking for the girl she was.

She stands by the pool saying, from time to time,
I was abducted, but it sounds
wrong to her, nothing like what she felt.
Then she says, I was not abducted.
Then she says, I offered myself, I wanted
to escape my body. Even, sometimes,
I willed this. But ignorance

cannot will knowledge. Ignorance
wills something imagined, which it believes exists.

All the different nouns—
she says them in rotation.
Death, husband, god, stranger.
Everything sounds so simple, so conventional.
I must have been, she thinks, a simple girl.

She can't remember herself as that person
but she keeps thinking the pool will remember
and explain to her the meaning of her prayer
so she can understand
whether it was answered or not.",Persephone was abducted from the pool by her uncle. She remembers the last moment she saw her husband before he died. She asks the pool to explain to her the meaning of her prayer.
The Angel,"I dreamt a dream!  What can it mean?
And that I was a maiden Queen
Guarded by an Angel mild:
Witless woe was ne’er beguiled!

And I wept both night and day,
And he wiped my tears away;
And I wept both day and night,
And hid from him my heart’s delight.

So he took his wings, and fled;
Then the morn blushed rosy red.
I dried my tears, and armed my fears
With ten thousand shields and spears.

Soon my Angel came again;
I was armed, he came in vain;
For the time of youth was fled,
And grey hairs were on my head.",I dreamt a dream!  What can it mean? I was a maiden Queen.Guarded by an Angel mild.Witless woe was ne’er beguiled!
Enigma,"It would be easy to forgive,
If I could but remember;
If I could hear, lost love of mine,
The music of your cruelties,
Shaking to sound the silent skies,
Could voice with them their song divine,
Red with pain’s leaping ember:
It would be easy to forgive,
If I could but remember.
It would be easy to forget,
If I could find lost Sorrow;
If I could kiss her plaintive face,
And break with her her bitter bread,
Could share again her woeful bed,
And know with tears her pale embrace.
Make yesterday, to-morrow:
It would be easy to forget,
If I could find lost Sorrow.
 ","It would be easy to forget, if I could find lost Sorrow, he writes. ""If I could kiss her plaintive face, and break with her her bitter bread, I could share again her woeful bed,"" he adds."
The Watchers,"Beside a stricken field I stood;
On the torn turf, on grass and wood,
Hung heavily the dew of blood.
Still in their fresh mounds lay the slain,
But all the air was quick with pain
And gusty sighs and tearful rain.
Two angels, each with drooping head
And folded wings and noiseless treads,
Watched by that valley of the dead.
The one, with forehead saintly bland
And lips of blessing, not command,
Leaned, weeping, on her olive wand.
The other’s brows were scarred and knit,
His restless eyes were watch-fires lit,
His hands for battle-gauntlets fit.
“How long!”—I knew the voice of Peace,
“Is there no respite? no release?
When shall the hopeless quarrel cease?
“O Lord, how long! One human soul
Is more than any parchment scroll,
Or any flag thy winds unroll.
“What price was Ellsworth’s, young and brave?
How weigh the gift that Lyon gave,
Or count the cost of Winthrop’s grave?
“O brother! if thine eye can see,
Tell how and when the end shall be,
What hope remains for thee and me.”
Then Freedom sternly said: “I shun
No strife nor pang beneath the sun,
When human rights are staked and won.
“I knelt with Ziska’s hunted flock,
I watched in Toussaint’s cell of rock,
I walked with Sidney to the block.
“The moor of Marston felt my tread,
Through Jersey snows the march I led,
My voice Magenta’s charges sped.
“But now, through weary day and night,
I watch a vague and aimless fight
For leave to strike one blow aright.
“On either side my foe they own:
One guards through love his ghastly throne,
And one through fear to reverence grown.
“Why wait we longer, mocked, betrayed,
By open foes, or those afraid
To speed thy coming through my aid?
“Why watch to see who win or fall?
I shake the dust against them all,
I leave them to their senseless brawl.”
“Nay,” Peace implored: “yet longer wait;
The doom is near, the stake is great:
God knoweth if it be too late.
“Still wait and watch; the way prepare
Where I with folded wings of prayer
May follow, weaponless and bare.”
“Too late!” the stern, sad voice replied,
“Too late!” its mournful echo sighed,
In low lament the answer died.
A rustling as of wings in flight,
An upward gleam of lessening white,
So passed the vision, sound and sight.
But round me, like a silver bell
Rung down the listening sky to tell
Of holy help, a sweet voice fell.
“Still hope and trust,” it sang; “the rod
Must fall, the wine-press must be trod,
But all is possible with God!”","“I knelt with Ziska’s hunted flock,” he writes. “I watched in Toussaint’S cell of rock,’ he adds. ‘I walked with Sidney to the block.’ ‘The moor of Marston felt my tread,Through Jersey snows the march I led,‘ he says."
One Today,"A Poem for Barack Obama’s Presidential Inauguration
January 21, 2013
  One sun rose on us today, kindled over our shores,
peeking over the Smokies, greeting the faces
of the Great Lakes, spreading a simple truth
across the Great Plains, then charging across the Rockies.
One light, waking up rooftops, under each one, a story
told by our silent gestures moving behind windows.
My face, your face, millions of faces in morning’s mirrors,
each one yawning to life, crescendoing into our day:
pencil-yellow school buses, the rhythm of traffic lights,
fruit stands: apples, limes, and oranges arrayed like rainbows
begging our praise. Silver trucks heavy with oil or paper—
bricks or milk, teeming over highways alongside us,
on our way to clean tables, read ledgers, or save lives—
to teach geometry, or ring-up groceries as my mother did
for twenty years, so I could write this poem.
All of us as vital as the one light we move through,
the same light on blackboards with lessons for the day:
equations to solve, history to question, or atoms imagined,
the “I have a dream” we keep dreaming,
or the impossible vocabulary of sorrow that won’t explain
the empty desks of twenty children marked absent
today, and forever. Many prayers, but one light
breathing color into stained glass windows,
life into the faces of bronze statues, warmth
onto the steps of our museums and park benches
as mothers watch children slide into the day.
One ground. Our ground, rooting us to every stalk
of corn, every head of wheat sown by sweat
and hands, hands gleaning coal or planting windmills
in deserts and hilltops that keep us warm, hands
digging trenches, routing pipes and cables, hands
as worn as my father’s cutting sugarcane
so my brother and I could have books and shoes.
The dust of farms and deserts, cities and plains
mingled by one wind—our breath. Breathe. Hear it
through the day’s gorgeous din of honking cabs,
buses launching down avenues, the symphony
of footsteps, guitars, and screeching subways,
the unexpected song bird on your clothes line.
Hear: squeaky playground swings, trains whistling,
or whispers across café tables, Hear: the doors we open
for each other all day, saying: hello / shalom,
buon giorno / howdy / namaste / or buenos días
in the language my mother taught me—in every language
spoken into one wind carrying our lives
without prejudice, as these words break from my lips.
One sky: since the Appalachians and Sierras claimed
their majesty, and the Mississippi and Colorado worked
their way to the sea. Thank the work of our hands:
weaving steel into bridges, finishing one more report
for the boss on time, stitching another wound
or uniform, the first brush stroke on a portrait,
or the last floor on the Freedom Tower
jutting into a sky that yields to our resilience.
One sky, toward which we sometimes lift our eyes
tired from work: some days guessing at the weather
of our lives, some days giving thanks for a love
that loves you back, sometimes praising a mother
who knew how to give, or forgiving a father
who couldn’t give what you wanted.
We head home: through the gloss of rain or weight
of snow, or the plum blush of dusk, but always—home,
always under one sky, our sky. And always one moon
like a silent drum tapping on every rooftop
and every window, of one country—all of us—
facing the stars
hope—a new constellation
waiting for us to map it,
waiting for us to name it—together

Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening,"Whose woods these are I think I know.
His house is in the village though;
He will not see me stopping here
To watch his woods fill up with snow.
My little horse must think it queer
To stop without a farmhouse near
Between the woods and frozen lake
The darkest evening of the year.
He gives his harness bells a shake
To ask if there is some mistake.
The only other sound's the sweep
Of easy wind and downy flake.
The woods are lovely, dark and deep.
But I have promises to keep,
And miles to go before I sleep,
And miles to go before I sleep.","The woods are lovely, dark and deep. But I have promises to keep,                And miles to go before I sleep,                . The only other sound's the sweep of easy wind and downy flake."

I measure every Grief I meet (561),"I measure every Grief I meet

Song of Nature,"Mine are the night and morning,
The pits of air, the gulf of space,
The sportive sun, the gibbous moon,
The innumerable days.
I hid in the solar glory,
I am dumb in the pealing song,
I rest on the pitch of the torrent,
In slumber I am strong.
No numbers have counted my tallies,
No tribes my house can fill,
I sit by the shining Fount of Life,
And pour the deluge still;
And ever by delicate powers
Gathering along the centuries
From race on race the rarest flowers,
My wreath shall nothing miss.
And many a thousand summers
My apples ripened well,
And light from meliorating stars
With firmer glory fell.
I wrote the past in characters
Of rock and fire the scroll,
The building in the coral sea,
The planting of the coal.
And thefts from satellites and rings
And broken stars I drew,
And out of spent and aged things
I formed the world anew;
What time the gods kept carnival,
Tricked out in star and flower,
And in cramp elf and saurian forms
They swathed their too much power.
Time and Thought were my surveyors,
They laid their courses well,
They boiled the sea, and baked the layers
Or granite, marl, and shell.
But he, the man-child glorious,—
Where tarries he the while?
The rainbow shines his harbinger,
The sunset gleams his smile.
My boreal lights leap upward,
Forthright my planets roll,
And still the man-child is not born,
The summit of the whole.
Must time and tide forever run?
Will never my winds go sleep in the west?
Will never my wheels which whirl the sun
And satellites have rest?
Too much of donning and doffing,
Too slow the rainbow fades,
I weary of my robe of snow,
My leaves and my cascades;
I tire of globes and races,
Too long the game is played;
What without him is summer's pomp,
Or winter’s frozen shade?
I travail in pain for him,
My creatures travail and wait;
His couriers come by squadrons,
He comes not to the gate.
Twice I have moulded an image,
And thrice outstretched my hand,
Made one of day, and one of night,
And one of the salt sea-sand.
One in a Judaean manger,
And one by Avon stream,
One over against the mouths of Nile,
And one in the Academe.
I moulded kings and saviours,
And bards o’er kings to rule;—
But fell the starry influence short,
The cup was never full.
Yet whirl the glowing wheels once more,
And mix the bowl again;
Seethe, fate! the ancient elements,
Heat, cold, wet, dry, and peace, and pain.
Let war and trade and creeds and song
Blend, ripen race on race,
The sunburnt world a man shall breed
Of all the zones, and countless days.
No ray is dimmed, no atom worn,
My oldest force is good as new,
And the fresh rose on yonder thorn
Gives back the bending heavens in dew.","""I sit by the shining Fount of Life, the sportive sun, the gibbous moon, and the innumerable days. I hid in the solar glory, I am dumb in the pealing song, I rest on the pitch of the torrent, in slumber I am strong,"" he writes."
The Road Not Taken,"Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,
And sorry I could not travel both
And be one traveler, long I stood
And looked down one as far as I could
To where it bent in the undergrowth;
Then took the other, as just as fair,
And having perhaps the better claim,
Because it was grassy and wanted wear;
Though as for that the passing there
Had worn them really about the same,
And both that morning equally lay
In leaves no step had trodden black.
Oh, I kept the first for another day!
Yet knowing how way leads on to way,
I doubted if I should ever come back.
I shall be telling this with a sigh
Somewhere ages and ages hence:
Two roads diverged in a wood, and I—
I took the one less traveled by,
And that has made all the difference.","Two roads diverged in a yellow wood, and sorry I could not travel both, long I stood. I took the one less traveled by, and that has made all the difference."
Kubla Khan,"Or a Vision in a Dream. A Fragment
In Xanadu did Kubla Khan
A stately pleasure dome decree:
Where Alph, the sacred river, ran
Through caverns measureless to man
    Down to a sunless sea.
So twice five miles of fertile ground
With walls and towers were girdled round:
And there were gardens bright with sinuous rills,
Where blossomed many an incense-bearing tree;
And here were forests ancient as the hills,
Enfolding sunny spots of greenery.
But oh! that deep romantic chasm which slanted
Down the green hill athwart a cedarn cover!
A savage place! as holy and enchanted
As e'er beneath a waning moon was haunted
By woman wailing for her demon lover!
And from this chasm, with ceaseless turmoil seething,
As if this earth in fast thick pants were breathing,
A mighty fountain momently was forced:
Amid whose swift half-intermitted burst
Huge fragments vaulted like rebounding hail,
Or chaffy grain beneath the thresher's flail:
And ’mid these dancing rocks at once and ever
It flung up momently the sacred river.
Five miles meandering with a mazy motion
Through wood and dale the sacred river ran,
Then reached the caverns measureless to man,
And sank in tumult to a lifeless ocean:
And ’mid this tumult Kubla heard from far
Ancestral voices prophesying war!
    The shadow of the dome of pleasure
    Floated midway on the waves;
    Where was heard the mingled measure
    From the fountain and the caves.
It was a miracle of rare device,
A sunny pleasure-dome with caves of ice!
    A damsel with a dulcimer
    In a vision once I saw;
    It was an Abyssinian maid,
    And on her dulcimer she played,
    Singing of Mount Abora.
    Could I revive within me
    Her symphony and song,
    To such a deep delight ’twould win me,
That with music loud and long,
I would build that dome in air,
That sunny dome! those caves of ice!
And all who heard should see them there,
And all should cry, Beware! Beware!
His flashing eyes, his floating hair!
Weave a circle round him thrice,
And close your eyes with holy dread,
For he on honey-dew hath fed,
And drunk the milk of Paradise.","In Xanadu did Kubla Khan decree:Where Alph, the sacred river, ran through caverns measureless to man, down to a sunless sea. The shadow of the dome of pleasureFloated midway on the waves; where was heard the mingled measure and song of Mount Abora."
On Love,"Then said Almitra, Speak to us of Love.
     And he raised his head and looked upon the people, and there fell a stillness upon them. And with a great voice he said:
     When love beckons to you, follow him,
     Though his ways are hard and steep.
     And when his wings enfold you yield to him,
     Though the sword hidden among his pinions may wound you.
     And when he speaks to you believe in him,
     Though his voice may shatter your dreams as the north wind lays waste the garden.
     For even as love crowns you so shall he crucify you. Even as he is for your growth so is he for your pruning.
     Even as he ascends to your height and caresses your tenderest branches that quiver in the sun,
     So shall he descend to your roots and shake them in their clinging to the earth.
     Like sheaves of corn he gathers you unto himself
     He threshes you to make your naked.
     He sifts you to free you from your husks.
     He grinds you to whiteness.
     He kneads you until you are pliant;
     And then he assigns you to his sacred fire, that you may become sacred bread for God’s sacred feast.
     All these things shall love do unto you that you may know the secrets of your heart, and in that knowledge become a fragment of Life’s heart.
     But if in your heart you would seek only love’s peace and love’s pleasure,
     Then it is better for you that you cover your nakedness and pass out of love’s threshing-floor,
     Into the seasonless world where you shall laugh, but not all of your laughter, and weep, but not all of your tears.
     Love gives naught but itself and takes naught but from itself.
     Love possesses not nor would it be possessed;
     For love is sufficient unto love.
     When you love you should not say, “God is in my heart,” but rather, “I am in the heart of God.”
     And think not you can direct the course of love, for love, if it finds you worthy, directs your course.
     Love has no other desire but to fulfil itself.
     But if you love and must needs have desires, let these be your desires:
     To melt and be like a running brook that sings its melody to the night.
     To know the pain of too much tenderness.
     To be wounded by your own understanding of love;
     And to bleed willingly and joyfully.
     To wake at dawn with a winged heart and give thanks for another day of loving;
     To rest at the noon hour and meditate love’s ecstasy;
     To return home at eventide with gratitude;
     And then to sleep with a prayer for the beloved in your heart and a song of praise upon your lips.","Almitra spoke of the power of love and how it can change our lives. He said that love can make us laugh and weep, but not all of our tears."
I Have a Rendezvous with Death,"I have a rendezvous with Death
At some disputed barricade,
When Spring comes back with rustling shade
And apple-blossoms fill the air—
I have a rendezvous with Death
When Spring brings back blue days and fair.
It may be he shall take my hand
And lead me into his dark land
And close my eyes and quench my breath—
It may be I shall pass him still.
I have a rendezvous with Death
On some scarred slope of battered hill,
When Spring comes round again this year
And the first meadow-flowers appear.
God knows ’twere better to be deep
Pillowed in silk and scented down,
Where love throbs out in blissful sleep,
Pulse nigh to pulse, and breath to breath,
Where hushed awakenings are dear...
But I’ve a rendezvous with Death
At midnight in some flaming town,
When Spring trips north again this year,
And I to my pledged word am true,
I shall not fail that rendezvous.","I have a rendezvous with Death at some disputed barricade, when Spring comes back with rustling shade and apple-blossoms fill the air. I to my pledged word am true, I shall not fail that rendezvous."
On Joy and Sorrow,"Then a woman said, Speak to us of Joy and Sorrow.
And he answered:
Your joy is your sorrow unmasked.
And the selfsame well from which your laughter rises was oftentimes filled with your tears.
And how else can it be?
The deeper that sorrow carves into your being, the more joy you can contain.
Is not the cup that holds your wine the very cup that was burned in the potter’s oven?
And is not the lute that soothes your spirit, the very wood that was hollowed with knives?
When you are joyous, look deep into your heart and you shall find it is only that which has given you sorrow that is giving you joy.
When you are sorrowful look again in your heart, and you shall see that in truth you are weeping for that which has been your delight.
Some of you say, “Joy is greater than sorrow,” and others say, “Nay, sorrow is the greater.”
But I say unto you, they are inseparable.
Together they come, and when one sits alone with you at your board, remember that the other is asleep upon your bed.
Verily you are suspended like scales between your sorrow and your joy.
Only when you are empty are you at standstill and balanced.
When the treasure-keeper lifts you to weigh his gold and his silver, needs must your joy or your sorrow rise or fall.","The deeper that sorrow carves into your being, the more joy you can contain. When you are empty are you at standstill and balanced. When the treasure-keeper lifts you to weigh his gold and his silver, needs must your joy or your sorrow rise or fall."
Instructions on Not Giving Up,"More than the fuchsia funnels breaking out
of the crabapple tree, more than the neighbor’s
almost obscene display of cherry limbs shoving
their cotton candy-colored blossoms to the slate
sky of Spring rains, it’s the greening of the trees
that really gets to me. When all the shock of white
and taffy, the world’s baubles and trinkets, leave
the pavement strewn with the confetti of aftermath,
the leaves come. Patient, plodding, a green skin
growing over whatever winter did to us, a return
to the strange idea of continuous living despite
the mess of us, the hurt, the empty. Fine then,
I’ll take it, the tree seems to say, a new slick leaf
unfurling like a fist to an open palm, I’ll take it all.","More than the fuchsia funnels breaking out of the crabapple tree, it’s the greening of the trees that really gets to me.

Yours,"I am yours as the summer air at evening is
Possessed by the scent of linden blossoms,

As the snowcap gleams with light
Lent it by the brimming moon.

Without you I'd be an unleafed tree
Blasted in a bleakness with no Spring.

Under the Harvest Moon,"   Under the harvest moon, 
When the soft silver
Drips shimmering
Over the garden nights,
Death, the gray mocker, 
Comes and whispers to you
As a beautiful friend
Who remembers.

   Under the summer roses 
When the flagrant crimson
Lurks in the dusk
Of the wild red leaves,
Love, with little hands,
Comes and touches you
With a thousand memories, 
And asks you
Beautiful, unanswerable questions.","The book is about a young man's love for his mother, his father, his brother and his grandmother. The book is called ""The Story of My Mother"" and is published by Penguin Books."
The Stolen Child,"Where dips the rocky highland
Of Sleuth Wood in the lake,
There lies a leafy island
Where flapping herons wake
The drowsy water rats;
There we've hid our faery vats,
Full of berrys
And of reddest stolen cherries.
Come away, O human child!
To the waters and the wild
With a faery, hand in hand,
For the world's more full of weeping than you can understand.
Where the wave of moonlight glosses
The dim gray sands with light,
Far off by furthest Rosses
We foot it all the night,
Weaving olden dances
Mingling hands and mingling glances
Till the moon has taken flight;
To and fro we leap
And chase the frothy bubbles,
While the world is full of troubles
And anxious in its sleep.
Come away, O human child!
To the waters and the wild
With a faery, hand in hand,
For the world's more full of weeping than you can understand.
Where the wandering water gushes
From the hills above Glen-Car,
In pools among the rushes
That scarce could bathe a star,
We seek for slumbering trout
And whispering in their ears
Give them unquiet dreams;
Leaning softly out
From ferns that drop their tears
Over the young streams.
Come away, O human child!
To the waters and the wild
With a faery, hand in hand,
For the world's more full of weeping than you can understand.
Away with us he's going,
The solemn-eyed:
He'll hear no more the lowing
Of the calves on the warm hillside
Or the kettle on the hob
Sing peace into his breast,
Or see the brown mice bob
Round and round the oatmeal chest.
For he comes, the human child,
To the waters and the wild
With a faery, hand in hand,
For the world's more full of weeping than he can understand.","We foot it all the night, weaving olden dances, weeding olden berry vats. We seek for slumbering trout, whispering in their ears. We chase the frothy bubbles, chasing the bubbles, while the world is full of troubles. The world's more full of weeping than you can understand."
Ars Poetica,"A poem should be palpable and mute
As a globed fruit,
Dumb
As old medallions to the thumb,
Silent as the sleeve-worn stone
Of casement ledges where the moss has grown—
A poem should be wordless
As the flight of birds.
                 *
A poem should be motionless in time
As the moon climbs,
Leaving, as the moon releases
Twig by twig the night-entangled trees,
Leaving, as the moon behind the winter leaves,
Memory by memory the mind—
A poem should be motionless in time
As the moon climbs.
                  *
A poem should be equal to:
Not true.
For all the history of grief
An empty doorway and a maple leaf.
For love
The leaning grasses and two lights above the sea—
A poem should not mean
But be.","A poem should be motionless in time as the moon climbs. A poem should not mean to be true, but to be palpable and mute. An empty doorway and a maple leaf should be equal to love."
Novel,"I.

No one's serious at seventeen.
—On beautiful nights when beer and lemonade
And loud, blinding cafés are the last thing you need
—You stroll beneath green lindens on the promenade.

Lindens smell fine on fine June nights!
Sometimes the air is so sweet that you close your eyes;
The wind brings sounds—the town is near—
And carries scents of vineyards and beer. . .

II.

—Over there, framed by a branch
You can see a little patch of dark blue
Stung by a sinister star that fades
With faint quiverings, so small and white. . .

June nights! Seventeen!—Drink it in.
Sap is champagne, it goes to your head. . .
The mind wanders, you feel a kiss
On your lips, quivering like a living thing. . .

III.

The wild heart Crusoes through a thousand novels
—And when a young girl walks alluringly
Through a streetlamp's pale light, beneath the ominous shadow
Of her father's starched collar. . .

Because as she passes by, boot heels tapping,
She turns on a dime, eyes wide, 
Finding you too sweet to resist. . .
—And cavatinas die on your lips.

IV.

You're in love. Off the market till August.
You're in love.—Your sonnets make Her laugh.
Your friends are gone, you're bad news.
—Then, one night, your beloved, writes. . .!

That night. . .you return to the blinding cafés;
You order beer or lemonade. . .
—No one's serious at seventeen 
When lindens line the promenade.
29 September 1870","On beautiful nights when beer and lemonade are the last thing you need, you stroll beneath green lindens on the promenade. The air is so sweet that you close your eyes; the town is near, and the wind carries scents of vineyards and beer."
Not Waving but Drowning,"Nobody heard him, the dead man,
But still he lay moaning:
I was much further out than you thought
And not waving but drowning.
Poor chap, he always loved larking
And now he’s dead
It must have been too cold for him his heart gave way,
They said.
Oh, no no no, it was too cold always
(Still the dead one lay moaning)
I was much too far out all my life
And not waving but drowning.","Nobody heard him, the dead man, but still he lay moaning. He said: ""I was much further out than you thought and not waving but drowning"""
"To John Keats, Poet. At Spring Time*","(For Carl Van Vechten)
I cannot hold my peace, John Keats;
There never was a spring like this;
It is an echo, that repeats
My last year's song and next year's bliss.
I know, in spite of all men say
Of Beauty, you have felt her most.
Yea, even in your grave her way
Is laid. Poor, troubled, lyric ghost,
Spring never was so fair and dear
As Beauty makes her seem this year.
I cannot hold my peace, John Keats,
I am as helpless in the toil
Of Spring as any lamb that bleats
To feel the solid earth recoil
Beneath his puny legs. Spring beats
Her tocsin call to those who love her,
And lo! the dogwood petals cover
Her breast with drifts of snow, and sleek
White gulls fly screaming to her, and hover
About her shoulders, and kiss her cheek,
While white and purple lilacs muster
A strength that bears them to a cluster
Of color and odor; for her sake
All things that slept are now awake.
And you and I, shall we lie still,
John Keats, while Beauty summons us?
Somehow I feel your sensitive will
Is pulsing up some tremulous
Sap road of a maple tree, whose leaves
Grow music as they grow, since your
Wild voice is in them, a harp that grieves
For life that opens death's dark door.
Though dust, your fingers still can push
The Vision Splendid to a birth,
Though now they work as grass in the hush
Of the night on the broad sweet page of the earth.
""John Keats is dead,"" they say, but I
Who hear your full insistent cry
In bud and blossom, leaf and tree,
Know John Keats still writes poetry.
And while my head is earthward bowed
To read new life sprung from your shroud,
Folks seeing me must think it strange
That merely spring should so derange
My mind. They do not know that you,
John Keats, keep revel with me, too.
  *Spring, 1924","John Keats' poem, ""Spring,"" was published in 1924. The poem was written in the style of Carl Van Vechten. ""Spring never was so fair and dear as Beauty makes her seem this year"""
Final Soliloquy of the Interior Paramour,"Light the first light of evening, as in a room
In which we rest and, for small reason, think
The world imagined is the ultimate good.

This is, therefore, the intensest rendezvous. 
It is in that thought that we collect ourselves,
Out of all the indifferences, into one thing:

Within a single thing, a single shawl
Wrapped tightly round us, since we are poor, a warmth, 
A light, a power, the miraculous influence.

Here, now, we forget each other and ourselves.
We feel the obscurity of an order, a whole, 
A knowledge, that which arranged the rendezvous.

Within its vital boundary, in the mind.
We say God and the imagination are one... 
How high that highest candle lights the dark.

Out of this same light, out of the central mind, 
We make a dwelling in the evening air, 
In which being there together is enough.","The world imagined is the ultimate good. Light the first light of evening, as in a room in which we rest and, for small reason, think. We feel the obscurity of an order, a whole, a knowledge."
"The Merchant of Venice, Act IV, Scene I [The quality of mercy is not strained]","The quality of mercy is not strained;
It droppeth as the gentle rain from heaven
Upon the place beneath. It is twice blest;
It blesseth him that gives and him that takes:
'T is mightiest in the mightiest; it becomes
The throned monarch better than his crown:
His sceptre shows the force of temporal power,
The attribute to awe and majesty,
Wherein doth sit the dread and fear of kings;
But mercy is above this sceptred sway;
It is enthronèd in the hearts of kings,
It is an attribute to God himself;
And earthly power doth then show likest God's
When mercy seasons justice. Therefore, Jew,
Though justice be thy plea, consider this,
That, in the course of justice, none of us
Should see salvation: we do pray for mercy;
And that same prayer doth teach us all to render
The deeds of mercy. I have spoke thus much
To mitigate the justice of thy plea;
Which if thou follow, this strict court of Venice
Must needs give sentence 'gainst the merchant there.",Mercy is not strained. It droppeth as the gentle rain from heaven. It is twice blest. It blesseth him that gives and him that takes. It becomes mightiest in the mightiest; it becomes better than his crown.
Loveliest of Trees,"Loveliest of trees, the cherry now
Is hung with bloom along the bough,
And stands about the woodland ride
Wearing white for Eastertide.
Now, of my threescore years and ten,
Twenty will not come again,
And take from seventy springs a score,
It only leaves me fifty more.
And since to look at things in bloom
Fifty springs are little room,
About the woodlands I will go
To see the cherry hung with snow.","The cherry is hung with bloom along the bough,                Wearing white for Eastertide. Of my threescore years and ten,                Twenty will not come again,                And take from seventy springs a score,                It only leaves me fifty more."
"Lay of the Last Minstrel, Canto VI, [My Native Land]","   Breathes there the man, with soul so dead,
Who never to himself hath said,
   This is my own, my native land!
Whose heart hath ne'er within him burn'd,
As home his footsteps he hath turn'd
   From wandering on a foreign strand!
If such there breathe, go, mark him well;
For him no Minstrel raptures swell;
High though his titles, proud his name,
Boundless his wealth as wish can claim;—
Despite those titles, power, and pelf,
The wretch, concentred all in self,
Living, shall forfeit fair renown,
And, doubly dying, shall go down
To the vile dust, from whence he sprung,
Unwept, unhonour'd, and unsung.","High though his titles, proud his name, boundless his wealth as wish can claim. Despite those titles, power, and pelf, the wretch, concentred all in self, shall forfeit fair renown, and go down to the vile dust."
The Land of Counterpane,"When I was sick and lay a-bed,
I had two pillows at my head,
And all my toys beside me lay
To keep me happy all the day.
And sometimes for an hour or so
I watched my leaden soldiers go,
With different uniforms and drills,
Among the bed-clothes, through the hills;
And sometimes sent my ships in fleets
All up and down among the sheets;
Or brought my trees and houses out,
And planted cities all about.
I was the giant great and still
That sits upon the pillow-hill,
And sees before him, dale and plain,
The pleasant land of counterpane.","When I was sick and lay a-bed, I had two pillows at my head,                And all my toys beside me lay.                I watched my leaden soldiers go,                With different uniforms and drills,                Among the bed-clothes, through the hills."
Aedh Wishes for the Cloths of Heaven,"Had I the heavens' embroidered cloths,
Enwrought with golden and silver light,
The blue and the dim and the dark cloths
Of night and light and the half light,
I would spread the cloths under your feet:
But I, being poor, have only my dreams;
I have spread my dreams under your feet;
Tread softly because you tread on my dreams.","""I, being poor, have only my dreams,"" he writes. ""Tread softly because you tread on my dreams"" ""I would spread the cloths under your feet,"" he adds."
Love's Philosophy,"The fountains mingle with the river
And the rivers with the ocean,
The winds of heaven mix for ever
With a sweet emotion;
Nothing in the world is single,
All things by a law divine
In one another's being mingle—
Why not I with thine?
See the mountains kiss high heaven,
And the waves clasp one another;
No sister-flower would be forgiven
If it disdain'd its brother;
And the sunlight clasps the earth,
And the moonbeams kiss the sea—
What is all this sweet work worth
If thou kiss not me?",The fountains mingle with the river and the rivers with the ocean. The winds of heaven mix for ever with a sweet emotion. Nothing in the world is single.
Before You Came,"Before you came,
things were as they should be:
the sky was the dead-end of sight,
the road was just a road, wine merely wine.

Now everything is like my heart,
a color at the edge of blood:
the grey of your absence, the color of poison, of thorns,
the gold when we meet, the season ablaze,
the yellow of autumn, the red of flowers, of flames,
and the black when you cover the earth
with the coal of dead fires.

And the sky, the road, the glass of wine?
The sky is a shirt wet with tears,
the road a vein about to break,
and the glass of wine a mirror in which
the sky, the road, the world keep changing.

Don't leave now that you're here—
Stay. So the world may become like itself again:
so the sky may be the sky,
the road a road,
and the glass of wine not a mirror, just a glass of wine.","Before you came, the sky was the dead-end of sight, the road was just a road, wine merely wine. Now everything is like my heart, a color at the edge of blood: grey of your absence, the color of poison, of thorns, gold when we meet."

Ozymandias,"I met a traveller from an antique land
Who said: “Two vast and trunkless legs of stone
Stand in the desert . . . Near them, on the sand,
Half sunk, a shattered visage lies, whose frown,
And wrinkled lip, and sneer of cold command,
Tell that its sculptor well those passions read
Which yet survive, stamped on these lifeless things,
The hand that mocked them, and the heart that fed:
And on the pedestal these words appear:
‘My name is Ozymandias, king of kings:
Look on my works, ye Mighty, and despair!’
Nothing beside remains. Round the decay
Of that colossal wreck, boundless and bare
The lone and level sands stretch far away.”",The work was created by the sculptor Ozymandias. The work was inspired by a traveller from an antique land. It is on display at the Museum of Modern Art in New York.
Little Orphant Annie,"Little Orphant Annie’s come to our house to stay,

An’ they seeked him in the rafter-room, an’ cubby-hole, an’ press,
An’ seeked him up the chimbly-flue, an’ ever’wheres, I guess;
But all they ever found was thist his pants an' roundabout--

A Blessing,"Just off the highway to Rochester, Minnesota,
Twilight bounds softly forth on the grass.
And the eyes of those two Indian ponies
Darken with kindness.
They have come gladly out of the willows
To welcome my friend and me.
We step over the barbed wire into the pasture
Where they have been grazing all day, alone.
They ripple tensely, they can hardly contain their happiness
That we have come.
They bow shyly as wet swans. They love each other.
There is no loneliness like theirs.
At home once more,
They begin munching the young tufts of spring in the darkness.
I would like to hold the slenderer one in my arms,
For she has walked over to me
And nuzzled my left hand.
She is black and white,
Her mane falls wild on her forehead,
And the light breeze moves me to caress her long ear
That is delicate as the skin over a girl’s wrist.
Suddenly I realize
That if I stepped out of my body I would break
Into blossom.","The author met two Indian ponies in Rochester, Minnesota. The pair have been friends since childhood. The author describes the moment he first met the ponies."
Life is Fine,"I went down to the river,
I set down on the bank.
I tried to think but couldn't,
So I jumped in and sank.
I came up once and hollered!
I came up twice and cried!
If that water hadn't a-been so cold
I might've sunk and died.
     But it was      Cold in that water!      It was cold!
I took the elevator
Sixteen floors above the ground.
I thought about my baby
And thought I would jump down.
I stood there and I hollered!
I stood there and I cried!
If it hadn't a-been so high
I might've jumped and died.
     But it was      High up there!      It was high!
So since I'm still here livin',
I guess I will live on.
I could've died for love—
But for livin' I was born
Though you may hear me holler,
And you may see me cry—
I'll be dogged, sweet baby,
If you gonna see me die.
     Life is fine!      Fine as wine!      Life is fine!","I went down to the river, set down on the bank, and jumped in. I tried to think but couldn't, so I jumped in and sank. If that water hadn't a-been so cold, I might've sunk and died."
"As You Like It, Act II, Scene VII [All the world's a stage]","Jaques to Duke Senior
                   
                          All the world's a stage,
And all the men and women merely players;
They have their exits and their entrances,
And one man in his time plays many parts,
His acts being seven ages. At first, the infant,
Mewling and puking in the nurse's arms.
Then the whining schoolboy, with his satchel
And shining morning face, creeping like snail
Unwillingly to school. And then the lover,
Sighing like furnace, with a woeful ballad
Made to his mistress' eyebrow. Then a soldier,
Full of strange oaths and bearded like the pard,
Jealous in honor, sudden and quick in quarrel,
Seeking the bubble reputation
Even in the cannon's mouth. And then the justice,
In fair round belly with good capon lined,
With eyes severe and beard of formal cut,
Full of wise saws and modern instances;
And so he plays his part. The sixth age shifts
Into the lean and slippered pantaloon,
With spectacles on nose and pouch on side;
His youthful hose, well saved, a world too wide
For his shrunk shank, and his big manly voice,
Turning again toward childish treble, pipes
And whistles in his sound. Last scene of all,
That ends this strange eventful history,
Is second childishness and mere oblivion,
Sans teeth, sans eyes, sans taste, sans everything.
 ","Jaques to Duke Senior is a play by French playwright Frida Ghitis. The play is about a man who plays seven different roles in his life. Ghitis: ""One man in his time plays many parts, his acts being seven ages"""
Shall I compare thee to a summer’s day? (Sonnet 18),"Shall I compare thee to a summer’s day?
Thou art more lovely and more temperate.
Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,
And summer’s lease hath all too short a date.
Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,
And often is his gold complexion dimmed;
And every fair from fair sometime declines,
By chance, or nature’s changing course, untrimmed;
But thy eternal summer shall not fade,
Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow’st,
Nor shall death brag thou wand'rest in his shade,
When in eternal lines to Time thou grow'st.
    So long as men can breathe, or eyes can see,
    So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.","A summer's day is more lovely and more temperate than a winter's day. So long as men can breathe, or eyes can see, so long lives this, and this gives life to thee."
To My Dear and Loving Husband,"If ever two were one, then surely we.
If ever man were loved by wife, then thee;
If ever wife was happy in a man,
Compare with me ye women if you can.
I prize thy love more than whole mines of gold,
Or all the riches that the East doth hold.
My love is such that rivers cannot quench,
Nor ought but love from thee give recompense.
Thy love is such I can no way repay;
The heavens reward thee manifold, I pray.
Then while we live, in love let’s so persever,
That when we live no more we may live ever.","I prize thy love more than whole mines of gold,                Or all the riches that the East doth hold.                My love is such that rivers cannot quench,                Nor ought but love from thee give recompense.                If ever man were loved by wife, then thee.                Compare with me ye women if you can."
A Dream Within a Dream,"Take this kiss upon the brow!
And, in parting from you now,
Thus much let me avow:
You are not wrong who deem
That my days have been a dream;
Yet if hope has flown away
In a night, or in a day,
In a vision, or in none,
Is it therefore the less gone?
All that we see or seem
Is but a dream within a dream.
I stand amid the roar
Of a surf-tormented shore,
And I hold within my hand
Grains of the golden sand--
How few! yet how they creep
Through my fingers to the deep,
While I weep--while I weep!
O God! can I not grasp
Them with a tighter clasp?
O God! can I not save
One from the pitiless wave?
Is all that we see or seem
But a dream within a dream?","""All that we see or seemIs but a dream within a dream"" ""I stand amid the roar of a surf-tormented shore,And I hold within my hand the golden sand"" ""O God! can I not save one from the pitiless wave?"""
The More Loving One,"Looking up at the stars, I know quite well
That, for all they care, I can go to hell,
But on earth indifference is the least
We have to dread from man or beast.
How should we like it were stars to burn
With a passion for us we could not return?
If equal affection cannot be,
Let the more loving one be me.
Admirer as I think I am
Of stars that do not give a damn,
I cannot, now I see them, say
I missed one terribly all day.
Were all stars to disappear or die,
I should learn to look at an empty sky
And feel its total dark sublime,
Though this might take me a little time.","""I know quite well that, for all they care, I can go to hell,"" writes the poet. "" indifference is the least we have to dread from man or beast,"" he adds."
Ulysses,"It little profits that an idle king,
By this still hearth, among these barren crags,
Matched with an aged wife, I mete and dole
Unequal laws unto a savage race,
That hoard, and sleep, and feed, and know not me.
I cannot rest from travel; I will drink
Life to the lees. All times I have enjoyed
Greatly, have suffered greatly, both with those
That loved me, and alone; on shore, and when
Through scudding drifts the rainy Hyades
Vext the dim sea. I am become a name;
For always roaming with a hungry heart
Much have I seen and known—cities of men
And manners, climates, councils, governments,
Myself not least, but honored of them all,—
And drunk delight of battle with my peers,
Far on the ringing plains of windy Troy.
I am a part of all that I have met;
Yet all experience is an arch wherethrough
Gleams that untraveled world whose margin fades
For ever and for ever when I move.
How dull it is to pause, to make an end,
To rust unburnished, not to shine in use!
As though to breathe were life! Life piled on life
Were all too little, and of one to me
Little remains; but every hour is saved
From that eternal silence, something more,
A bringer of new things; and vile it were
For some three suns to store and hoard myself,
And this gray spirit yearning in desire
To follow knowledge like a sinking star,
Beyond the utmost bound of human thought.
   This is my son, mine own Telemachus,
To whom I leave the scepter and the isle,
Well-loved of me, discerning to fulfill
This labor, by slow prudence to make mild
A rugged people, and through soft degrees
Subdue them to the useful and the good.
Most blameless is he, centered in the sphere
Of common duties, decent not to fail
In offices of tenderness, and pay
Meet adoration to my household gods,
When I am gone. He works his work, I mine.
   There lies the port; the vessel puffs her sail;
There gloom the dark, broad seas. My mariners,
Souls that have toiled, and wrought, and thought with me,
That ever with a frolic welcome took
The thunder and the sunshine, and opposed
Free hearts, free foreheads—you and I are old;
Old age hath yet his honor and his toil.
Death closes all; but something ere the end,
Some work of noble note, may yet be done,
Not unbecoming men that strove with gods.
The lights begin to twinkle from the rocks;
The long day wanes; the slow moon climbs; the deep
Moans round with many voices. Come, my friends,
'Tis not too late to seek a newer world.
Push off, and sitting well in order smite
The sounding furrows; for my purpose holds
To sail beyond the sunset, and the baths
Of all the western stars, until I die.
It may be that the gulfs will wash us down;
It may be we shall touch the Happy Isles,
And see the great Achilles, whom we knew.
Though much is taken, much abides; and though
We are not now that strength which in old days
Moved earth and heaven, that which we are, we are,
One equal temper of heroic hearts,
Made weak by time and fate, but strong in will
To strive, to seek, to find, and not to yield.","""I am become a name; always roaming with a hungry heart,"" he writes. ""All times I have enjoyed, have suffered greatly, both with those that loved me, and alone,"" he adds. ""I cannot rest from travel; I will drink life to the lees,"" he says."
Archaic Torso of Apollo,"We cannot know his legendary head
with eyes like ripening fruit. And yet his torso
is still suffused with brilliance from inside,
like a lamp, in which his gaze, now turned to low,
gleams in all its power. Otherwise
the curved breast could not dazzle you so, nor could
a smile run through the placid hips and thighs
to that dark center where procreation flared.
Otherwise this stone would seem defaced
beneath the translucent cascade of the shoulders
and would not glisten like a wild beast's fur:
would not, from all the borders of itself,
burst like a star: for here there is no place
that does not see you. You must change your life.","We cannot know his legendary head                with eyes like ripening fruit. And yet his torso                is still suffused with brilliance from inside,                like a lamp, in which his gaze, now turned to low, is in all its power."
Greensickness,"after Gwendolyn Brooks
My wild grief didn’t know where to end.
Everywhere I looked: a field alive and unburied.
Whole swaths of green swallowed the light.
All around me, the field was growing. I grew out
My hair in every direction. Let the sun freckle my face.
Even in the greenest depths, I crouched
Towards the light. That summer, everything grew
So alive and so alone. A world hushed in green.
Wildest grief grew inside out.
I crawled to the field’s edge, bruises blooming
In every crevice of my palms.
I didn’t know I’d reached a shoreline till I felt it
There: A salt wind lifted
The hair from my neck.
At the edge of every green lies an ocean.
When I saw that blue, I knew then:
This world will end.
Grief is not the only geography I know.
Every wound closes. Repair comes with sweetness,
Come spring. Every empire will fall:
I must believe this. I felt it
Somewhere in the field: my ancestors
Murmuring Go home, go home—soon, soon.
No country wants me back anymore and I’m okay.
If grief is love with nowhere to go, then
Oh, I’ve loved so immensely.
That summer, everything I touched
Was green. All bruises will fade
From green and blue to skin.
Let me grow through this green
And not drown in it.
Let me be lawless and beloved,
Ungovernable and unafraid.
Let me be brave enough to live here.
Let me be precise in my actions.
Let me feel hurt.
I know I can heal.
Let me try again—again and again.","Gwendolyn Brooks wrote a book about her grief after the death of her husband. Brooks: “My wild grief didn’t know where to end. That summer, everything grew green.”"

In This Place (An American Lyric),"An original poem written for the inaugural reading of Poet Laureate Tracy K. Smith at the Library of Congress.
There’s a poem in this place—
in the footfalls in the halls
in the quiet beat of the seats.
It is here, at the curtain of day,
where America writes a lyric
you must whisper to say.
There’s a poem in this place—
in the heavy grace,
the lined face of this noble building,
collections burned and reborn twice.
There’s a poem in Boston’s Copley Square
where protest chants
tear through the air
like sheets of rain,
where love of the many
swallows hatred of the few.
There’s a poem in Charlottesville
where tiki torches string a ring of flame
tight round the wrist of night
where men so white they gleam blue—
seem like statues
where men heap that long wax burning
ever higher
where Heather Heyer
blooms forever in a meadow of resistance.
There’s a poem in the great sleeping giant
of Lake Michigan, defiantly raising
its big blue head to Milwaukee and Chicago—
a poem begun long ago, blazed into frozen soil,
strutting upward and aglow.
There’s a poem in Florida, in East Texas
where streets swell into a nexus
of rivers, cows afloat like mottled buoys in the brown,
where courage is now so common
that 23-year-old Jesus Contreras rescues people from floodwaters.
There’s a poem in Los Angeles
yawning wide as the Pacific tide
where a single mother swelters
in a windowless classroom, teaching
black and brown students in Watts
to spell out their thoughts
so her daughter might write
this poem for you.             
There's a lyric in California
where thousands of students march for blocks,
undocumented and unafraid;
where my friend Rosa finds the power to blossom
in deadlock, her spirit the bedrock of her community.
She knows hope is like a stubborn
ship gripping a dock,
a truth: that you can’t stop a dreamer
or knock down a dream.
How could this not be her city
su nación
our country
our America,
our American lyric to write—
a poem by the people, the poor,
the Protestant, the Muslim, the Jew,
the native, the immigrant,
the black, the brown, the blind, the brave,
the undocumented and undeterred,
the woman, the man, the nonbinary,
the white, the trans,
the ally to all of the above
and more?
Tyrants fear the poet.
Now that we know it
we can’t blow it.
We owe it
to show it
not slow it
although it
hurts to sew it
when the world
skirts below it.       
Hope—
we must bestow it
like a wick in the poet
so it can grow, lit,
bringing with it
stories to rewrite—
the story of a Texas city depleted but not defeated
a history written that need not be repeated
a nation composed but not yet completed.
There’s a poem in this place—
a poem in America
a poet in every American
who rewrites this nation, who tells
a story worthy of being told on this minnow of an earth
to breathe hope into a palimpsest of time—
a poet in every American
who sees that our poem penned
doesn’t mean our poem’s end.
There’s a place where this poem dwells—
it is here, it is now, in the yellow song of dawn’s bell
where we write an American lyric
we are just beginning to tell.","An original poem written for the inaugural reading of Poet Laureate Tracy K. Smith at the Library of Congress. There’s a poem in this place, in the footfalls in the halls and the quiet beat of the seats, the poet writes."
On Self-Knowledge,"And a man said, Speak to us of Self-Knowledge.
And he answered, saying:
Your hearts know in silence the secrets of the days and the nights.
But your ears thirst for the sound of your heart’s knowledge.
You would know in words that which you have always known in thought.
You would touch with your fingers the naked body of your dreams.
And it is well you should.
The hidden well-spring of your soul must needs rise and run murmuring to the sea;
And the treasure of your infinite depths would be revealed to your eyes.
But let there be no scales ot weigh your unknown treasure;
And seek not the depths of your knowledge with staff or sounding line.
For self is a sea boundless and measureless.
Say not, “I have found the truth,” but rather, “I have found a truth.” 
Say not, ""I have found the path of the soul.” Say rather, “I have met the soul walking upon my path.”
For the soul walks upon all paths.
The soul walks not upon a line, neither does it grow like a reed.
The soul unfolds itself, like a lotus of countless petals.","A man said, Speak to us of Self-Knowledge. And he answered, saying, Your hearts know in silence the secrets of the days and the nights."
The Raincoat,"When the doctor suggested surgery
and a brace for all my youngest years,
my parents scrambled to take me
to massage therapy, deep tissue work,
osteopathy, and soon my crooked spine
unspooled a bit, I could breathe again,
and move more in a body unclouded
by pain. My mom would tell me to sing
songs to her the whole forty-five minute
drive to Middle Two Rock Road and forty-
five minutes back from physical therapy.
She’d say, even my voice sounded unfettered
by my spine afterward. So I sang and sang,
because I thought she liked it. I never
asked her what she gave up to drive me,
or how her day was before this chore. Today,
at her age, I was driving myself home from yet
another spine appointment, singing along
to some maudlin but solid song on the radio,
and I saw a mom take her raincoat off
and give it to her young daughter when
a storm took over the afternoon. My god,
I thought, my whole life I’ve been under her
raincoat thinking it was somehow a marvel
that I never got wet.","When he was a child, a doctor suggested surgery and a brace for his crooked spine. His parents took him to massage therapy, deep tissue work, and soon he could breathe again. Today, he was driving himself home from another spine appointment, singing along with the radio."
Love at First Sight,"They’re both convinced
that a sudden passion joined them.
Such certainty is beautiful,
but uncertainty is more beautiful still.
Since they’d never met before, they’re sure
that there’d been nothing between them.
But what’s the word from the streets, staircases, hallways—
perhaps they’ve passed by each other a million times?
I want to ask them
if they don’t remember—
a moment face to face
in some revolving door?
perhaps a “sorry” muttered in a crowd?
a curt “wrong number” caught in the receiver?—
but I know the answer.
No, they don’t remember.
They’d be amazed to hear
that Chance has been toying with them
now for years.
Not quite ready yet
to become their Destiny,
it pushed them close, drove them apart,
it barred their path,
stifling a laugh,
and then leaped aside.
There were signs and signals,
even if they couldn’t read them yet.
Perhaps three years ago
or just last Tuesday
a certain leaf fluttered
from one shoulder to another?
Something was dropped and then picked up.
Who knows, maybe the ball that vanished
into childhood’s thicket?
There were doorknobs and doorbells
where one touch had covered another
beforehand.
Suitcases checked and standing side by side.
One night, perhaps, the same dream,
grown hazy by morning.
Every beginning
is only a sequel, after all,
and the book of events
is always open halfway through.","They’re both convinced that a sudden passion joined them. But what’s the word from the streets, staircases, hallways? Perhaps they’ve passed by each other a million times."
The Fish,"I caught a tremendous fish
and held him beside the boat
half out of water, with my hook
fast in a corner of his mouth.
He didn't fight.
He hadn't fought at all.
He hung a grunting weight,
battered and venerable
and homely. Here and there
his brown skin hung in strips
like ancient wallpaper,
and its pattern of darker brown
was like wallpaper:
shapes like full-blown roses
stained and lost through age.
He was speckled with barnacles,
fine rosettes of lime,
and infested
with tiny white sea-lice,
and underneath two or three
rags of green weed hung down.
While his gills were breathing in
the terrible oxygen
—the frightening gills,
fresh and crisp with blood,
that can cut so badly—
I thought of the coarse white flesh
packed in like feathers,
the big bones and the little bones,
the dramatic reds and blacks
of his shiny entrails,
and the pink swim-bladder
like a big peony.
I looked into his eyes
which were far larger than mine
but shallower, and yellowed,
the irises backed and packed
with tarnished tinfoil
seen through the lenses
of old scratched isinglass.
They shifted a little, but not
to return my stare.
—It was more like the tipping
of an object toward the light.
I admired his sullen face,
the mechanism of his jaw,
and then I saw
that from his lower lip
—if you could call it a lip—
grim, wet, and weaponlike,
hung five old pieces of fish-line,
or four and a wire leader
with the swivel still attached,
with all their five big hooks
grown firmly in his mouth.
A green line, frayed at the end
where he broke it, two heavier lines,
and a fine black thread
still crimped from the strain and snap
when it broke and he got away.
Like medals with their ribbons
frayed and wavering,
a five-haired beard of wisdom
trailing from his aching jaw.
I stared and stared
and victory filled up
the little rented boat,
from the pool of bilge
where oil had spread a rainbow
around the rusted engine
to the bailer rusted orange,
the sun-cracked thwarts,
the oarlocks on their strings,
the gunnels—until everything
was rainbow, rainbow, rainbow!
And I let the fish go.","I caught a tremendous fish and held him beside the boat. He didn't fight at all. He hung a grunting weight,battered and venerable. His brown skin hung in strips like ancient wallpaper."
How I Am,"When I talk to my friends I pretend I am standing on the wings 

of a flying plane. I cannot be trusted to tell them how I am. 
Or if I am falling to earth weighing less 

than a dozen roses. Sometimes I dream they have broken up 

with their lovers and are carrying food to my house. 
When I open the mailbox I hear their voices 

like the long upward-winding curve of a train whistle 

passing through the tall grasses and ferns 
after the train has passed. I never get ahead of their shadows. 

I embrace them in front of moving cars. I keep them away 

from my miseries because to say I am miserable is to say I am like them. ",When I talk to my friends I pretend I am standing on the wings of a flying plane. I cannot be trusted to tell them how I am. Sometimes I dream they have broken up with their lovers and are carrying food.
Dream Song 4,"Filling her compact & delicious body
with chicken páprika, she glanced at me
twice.
Fainting with interest, I hungered back
and only the fact of her husband & four other people
kept me from springing on her

or falling at her little feet and crying
'You are the hottest one for years of night
Henry's dazed eyes
have enjoyed, Brilliance.' I advanced upon
(despairing) my spumoni.—Sir Bones: is stuffed,
de world, wif feeding girls.

—Black hair, complexion Latin, jewelled eyes
downcast . . . The slob beside her     feasts . . . What wonders is
she sitting on, over there?
The restaurant buzzes.  She might as well be on Mars.
Where did it all go wrong? There ought to be a law against Henry.
—Mr. Bones: there is.","'You are the hottest one for years of night,' Henry's dazed eyes said. 'There ought to be a law against Henry'"
Dream Song 29,"There sat down, once, a thing on Henry's heart
só heavy, if he had a hundred years
& more, & weeping, sleepless, in all them time
Henry could not make good.
Starts again always in Henry's ears
the little cough somewhere, an odour, a chime.

And there is another thing he has in mind
like a grave Sienese face a thousand years
would fail to blur the still profiled reproach of.  Ghastly,
with open eyes, he attends, blind.
All the bells say: too late.  This is not for tears;
thinking.

But never did Henry, as he thought he did,
end anyone and hacks her body up
and hide the pieces, where they may be found.
He knows: he went over everyone, & nobody's missing.
Often he reckons, in the dawn, them up.
Nobody is ever missing.","Henry could not make good. There sat down, once, a thing on Henry's heart, if he had a hundred years                & more, & weeping, sleepless, in all them time."
Jabberwocky,"’Twas brillig, and the slithy toves
   Did gyre and gimble in the wabe;
All mimsy were the borogoves,
   And the mome raths outgrabe.
“Beware the Jabberwock, my son
   The jaws that bite, the claws that catch!
Beware the Jubjub bird, and shun
   The frumious Bandersnatch!”
He took his vorpal sword in hand;
   Long time the manxome foe he sought—
So rested he by the Tumtum tree,
   And stood awhile in thought.
And, as in uffish thought he stood,
   The Jabberwock, with eyes of flame,
Came whiffling through the tulgey wood,
   And burbled as it came!
One, two! One, two! And through and through
   The vorpal blade went snicker-snack!
He left it dead, and with its head
   He went galumphing back.
“And hast thou slain the Jabberwock?
   Come to my arms, my beamish boy!
O frabjous day! Callooh! Callay!”
   He chortled in his joy.
’Twas brillig, and the slithy toves
   Did gyre and gimble in the wabe;
All mimsy were the borogoves,
   And the mome raths outgrabe.","’Twas brillig, and the slithy toves774 Did gyre and gimble in the wabe;774All mimsy were the borogoves,774   And the mome raths outgrabe.774 ‘Beware the Jabberwock, my son.774 The jaws that bite, the claws that catch!774 Beware the Jubjub bird, and shun the Bandersnatch!774"
"In Memoriam, [Ring out, wild bells]","Ring out, wild bells, to the wild sky,
   The flying cloud, the frosty light:
   The year is dying in the night;
Ring out, wild bells, and let him die.
Ring out the old, ring in the new,
   Ring, happy bells, across the snow:
   The year is going, let him go;
Ring out the false, ring in the true.
Ring out the grief that saps the mind
   For those that here we see no more;
   Ring out the feud of rich and poor,
Ring in redress to all mankind.
Ring out a slowly dying cause,
   And ancient forms of party strife;
   Ring in the nobler modes of life,
With sweeter manners, purer laws.
Ring out the want, the care, the sin,
   The faithless coldness of the times;
   Ring out, ring out my mournful rhymes
But ring the fuller minstrel in.
Ring out false pride in place and blood,
   The civic slander and the spite;
   Ring in the love of truth and right,
Ring in the common love of good.
Ring out old shapes of foul disease;
   Ring out the narrowing lust of gold;
   Ring out the thousand wars of old,
Ring in the thousand years of peace.
Ring in the valiant man and free,
   The larger heart, the kindlier hand;
   Ring out the darkness of the land,
Ring in the Christ that is to be.","Ring out, wild bells, to the wild sky. Ring out the want, the care, the sin, The faithless coldness of the times. Ring in the Christ that is to be. Ring the fuller minstrel in."
Mother to Son,"Well, son, I’ll tell you: 
Life for me ain’t been no crystal stair.
It’s had tacks in it,
And splinters,
And boards torn up,
And places with no carpet on the floor—
Bare;
But all the time
I’se been a’climbin’ on,
And reachin’ landin’s,
And turnin’ corners, 
And sometimes goin’ in the dark, 
Where there ain’t been no light.
So boy, don’t you turn back;
Don’t you sit down on the steps, 
’Cause you finds it’s kinder hard;
Don’t you fall now—
For I’se still goin’, honey,
I’se still climbin’,
And life for me ain’t been no crystal stair.","Life for me ain’t been no crystal stair. It’s had tacks in it, and splinters, and boards torn up, and places with no carpet on the floor. But all the time, I’se been a’climbin’ on."
The Index,"In the beginning there was darkness,
then a bunch of other stuff—and lots of people.
Some things were said and loosely interpreted,
or maybe things were not communicated clearly.
Regardless—there has always been an index.
That thing about the meek—how we
shall inherit the earth; that was a promise
made in a treaty at the dawn of time
agreed upon in primordial darkness                
and documented in the spiritual record.
The nature of the agreement was thus:
The world will seemingly be pushed past capacity.
A new planet will be “discovered” 31 light-years away.   
Space travel will advance rapidly,
making the journey feasible. The ice sheets will melt.
Things will get ugly. The only way to leave
will be to buy a ticket. Tickets will be priced at exactly
the amount that can be accrued
by abandoning basic humanity.
The index will show how you came by your fortune:            
If you murdered, trafficked or exploited the vulnerable,
stole, embezzled, poisoned, cheated, swindled,
or otherwise subdued nature to come by wealth
great enough to afford passage to the new earth;
if your ancestors did these things and you’ve done nothing
to benefit from their crimes yet do nothing to atone
through returning inherited wealth to the greater good
you shall be granted passage. It was agreed.
The meek shall stay, the powerful shall leave.
And it all shall start again.
The meek shall inherit the earth,
and what shall we do with it,
but set about putting aside our meekness?",The meek shall inherit the earth; that was a promise made in a treaty at the dawn of time. Tickets will be priced at exactly the amount that can be accrued by abandoning basic humanity.
On Children,"And a woman who held a babe against her bosom said, Speak to us of Children.
     And he said:
     Your children are not your children.
     They are the sons and daughters of Life’s longing for itself.
     They come through you but not from you,
     And though they are with you yet they belong not to you.
     You may give them your love but not your thoughts,
     For they have their own thoughts.
     You may house their bodies but not their souls,
     For their souls dwell in the house of tomorrow, which you cannot visit, not even in your dreams.
     You may strive to be like them, but seek not to make them like you.
     For life goes not backward nor tarries with yesterday.
     You are the bows from which your children as living arrows are sent forth.
     The archer sees the mark upon the path of the infinite, and He bends you with His might that His arrows may go swift and far.
     Let your bending in the archer’s hand be for gladness;
     For even as He loves the arrow that flies, so He loves also the bow that is stable.","A woman held a babe against her bosom said, Speak to us of Children. He said: Your children are not your children. They are the sons and daughters of Life’s longing for itself."
Moonlily,"(Mather AFB, California, 1956)

When we play horses at recess, my name
is Moonlily and I’m a yearling mare.
We gallop circles around the playground,
whinnying, neighing, and shaking our manes.
We scrape the ground with scuffed saddle oxfords,
thunder around the little kids on swings
and seesaws, and around the boys’ ball games.
We’re sorrel, chestnut, buckskin, pinto, gray,
a herd in pastel dresses and white socks.
We’re self-named, untamed, untouched, unridden.
Our plains know no fences. We can smell spring.
The bell produces metamorphosis.
Still hot and flushed, we file back to our desks,
one bay in a room of palominos.","Moonlily and I are a yearling mare. We gallop circles around the playground,whinnying, neighing, and shaking our manes. Our plains know no fences. We can smell spring."
A Small Needful Fact,"Is that Eric Garner worked
for some time for the Parks and Rec.
Horticultural Department, which means,
perhaps, that with his very large hands,
perhaps, in all likelihood,
he put gently into the earth
some plants which, most likely,
some of them, in all likelihood,
continue to grow, continue
to do what such plants do, like house
and feed small and necessary creatures,
like being pleasant to touch and smell,
like converting sunlight
into food, like making it easier
for us to breathe.","Eric Garner worked for some time for the Parks and Rec. Department. Perhaps, with his large hands, he put gently into the earth some plants which, most likely, continue to grow."
So Much Happiness,"It is difficult to know what to do with so much happiness.
With sadness there is something to rub against,
a wound to tend with lotion and cloth.
When the world falls in around you, you have pieces to pick up,
something to hold in your hands, like ticket stubs or change.
But happiness floats.
It doesn’t need you to hold it down.
It doesn’t need anything.
Happiness lands on the roof of the next house, singing,
and disappears when it wants to.
You are happy either way.
Even the fact that you once lived in a peaceful tree house
and now live over a quarry of noise and dust
cannot make you unhappy.
Everything has a life of its own,
it too could wake up filled with possibilities
of coffee cake and ripe peaches,
and love even the floor which needs to be swept,
the soiled linens and scratched records . . .
Since there is no place large enough
to contain so much happiness,
you shrug, you raise your hands, and it flows out of you
into everything you touch. You are not responsible.
You take no credit, as the night sky takes no credit
for the moon, but continues to hold it, and share it,
and in that way, be known.","Happiness floats. It doesn’t need you to hold it down. With sadness there is something to rub against, a wound to tend with lotion and cloth."
The Power of the Dog,"There is sorrow enough in the natural way
From men and women to fill our day;
And when we are certain of sorrow in store,
Why do we always arrange for more?
Brothers and Sisters, I bid you beware
Of giving your heart to a dog to tear.
Buy a pup and your money will buy
Love unflinching that cannot lie—
Perfect passion and worship fed
By a kick in the ribs or a pat on the head.
Nevertheless it is hardly fair
To risk your heart for a dog to tear.
When the fourteen years which Nature permits
Are closing in asthma, or tumour, or fits,
And the vet’s unspoken prescription runs
To lethal chambers or loaded guns,
Then you will find—it’s your own affair—
But… you’ve given your heart to a dog to tear.
When the body that lived at your single will,
With its whimper of welcome, is stilled (how still!).
When the spirit that answered your every mood
Is gone—wherever it goes—for good,
You will discover how much you care,
And will give your heart to a dog to tear.
We’ve sorrow enough in the natural way,
When it comes to burying Christian clay.
Our loves are not given, but only lent,
At compound interest of cent per cent.
Though it is not always the case, I believe,
That the longer we’ve kept ’em, the more do we grieve:
For, when debts are payable, right or wrong,
A short-time loan is as bad as a long—
So why in—Heaven (before we are there)
Should we give our hearts to a dog to tear?","""When the body that lived at your single will, is stilled (how still), you will find that you have given your heart to a dog to tear"""
Kindness,"Before you know what kindness really is
you must lose things,
feel the future dissolve in a moment
like salt in a weakened broth.
What you held in your hand,
what you counted and carefully saved,
all this must go so you know
how desolate the landscape can be
between the regions of kindness.
How you ride and ride
thinking the bus will never stop,
the passengers eating maize and chicken
will stare out the window forever.
Before you learn the tender gravity of kindness
you must travel where the Indian in a white poncho
lies dead by the side of the road.
You must see how this could be you,
how he too was someone
who journeyed through the night with plans
and the simple breath that kept him alive.
Before you know kindness as the deepest thing inside,
you must know sorrow as the other deepest thing.
You must wake up with sorrow.
You must speak to it till your voice
catches the thread of all sorrows
and you see the size of the cloth.
Then it is only kindness that makes sense anymore,
only kindness that ties your shoes
and sends you out into the day to gaze at bread,
only kindness that raises its head
from the crowd of the world to say
It is I you have been looking for,
and then goes with you everywhere
like a shadow or a friend.","Before you know what kindness really is, you must lose things. You must feel the future dissolve in a moment like salt in a weakened broth. Only kindness that makes sense anymore is kindness that ties your shoes and sends you out into the day."

"Hamlet, Act III, Scene I [To be, or not to be]","To be, or not to be: that is the question:
Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer
The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune,
Or to take arms against a sea of troubles,
And by opposing end them? To die: to sleep;
No more; and by a sleep to say we end
The heart-ache and the thousand natural shocks
That flesh is heir to, 'tis a consummation
Devoutly to be wish'd. To die, to sleep;
To sleep: perchance to dream: ay, there's the rub;
For in that sleep of death what dreams may come
When we have shuffled off this mortal coil,
Must give us pause: there's the respect
That makes calamity of so long life;
For who would bear the whips and scorns of time,
The oppressor's wrong, the proud man's contumely,
The pangs of despised love, the law's delay,
The insolence of office and the spurns
That patient merit of the unworthy takes,
When he himself might his quietus make
With a bare bodkin? who would fardels bear,
To grunt and sweat under a weary life,
But that the dread of something after death,
The undiscover'd country from whose bourn
No traveller returns, puzzles the will
And makes us rather bear those ills we have
Than fly to others that we know not of?
Thus conscience does make cowards of us all;
And thus the native hue of resolution
Is sicklied o'er with the pale cast of thought,
And enterprises of great pith and moment
With this regard their currents turn awry,
And lose the name of action.—Soft you now!

Invictus,"Out of the night that covers me,   
  Black as the Pit from pole to pole,   
I thank whatever gods may be   
  For my unconquerable soul.   
In the fell clutch of circumstance 
  I have not winced nor cried aloud.   
Under the bludgeonings of chance   
  My head is bloody, but unbowed.   
Beyond this place of wrath and tears   
  Looms but the Horror of the shade, 
And yet the menace of the years   
  Finds, and shall find, me unafraid.

  How charged with punishments the scroll,

O Me! O Life!,"O Me! O life! of the questions of these recurring,
Of the endless trains of the faithless, of cities fill’d with the foolish,
Of myself forever reproaching myself, (for who more foolish than I, and who more faithless?)
Of eyes that vainly crave the light, of the objects mean, of the struggle ever renew’d,
Of the poor results of all, of the plodding and sordid crowds I see around me,
Of the empty and useless years of the rest, with the rest me intertwined,

That the powerful play goes on, and you may contribute a verse.","""O Me! O life"" is a poem written by the American poet Robert Frost. The poem asks the question, ""What good amid these, O me, O life?"""
"Twelfth Night, Act II, Scene III [O Mistress mine, where are you roaming?]","The Clown, singing

O Mistress mine, where are you roaming?  
O stay and hear! your true-love’s coming

Leaves,"                        1 

Every October it becomes important, no, necessary
to see the leaves turning, to be surrounded
by leaves turning; it's not just the symbolism,
to confront in the death of the year your death,
one blazing farewell appearance, though the irony 
isn't lost on you that nature is most seductive
when it's about to die, flaunting the dazzle of its 
incipient exit, an ending that at least so far 
the effects of human progress (pollution, acid rain)
have not yet frightened you enough to make you believe
is real; that is, you know this ending is a deception
because of course nature is always renewing itself—
        the trees don't die, they just pretend,
        go out in style, and return in style: a new style.





                        2 

Is it deliberate how far they make you go
especially if you live in the city to get far 
enough away from home to see not just trees 
but only trees? The boring highways, roadsigns, high 
speeds, 10-axle trucks passing you as if they were 
in an even greater hurry than you to look at leaves:
so you drive in terror for literal hours and it looks 
like rain, or snow, but it's probably just clouds
(too cloudy to see any color?) and you wonder, 
given the poverty of your memory, which road had the 
most color last year, but it doesn't matter since 
you're probably too late anyway, or too early—
        whichever road you take will be the wrong one
        and you've probably come all this way for nothing.






                        3 

You'll be driving along depressed when suddenly
a cloud will move and the sun will muscle through
and ignite the hills. It may not last. Probably
won't last. But for a moment the whole world
comes to. Wakes up. Proves it lives. It lives—
red, yellow, orange, brown, russet, ocher, vermilion,
gold. Flame and rust. Flame and rust, the permutations
of burning. You're on fire. Your eyes are on fire.
It won't last, you don't want it to last. You 
can't stand any more. But you don't want it to stop. 
It's what you've come for. It's what you'll
come back for. It won't stay with you, but you'll 
        remember that it felt like nothing else you've felt
        or something you've felt that also didn't last.","Every October it becomes important, no, necessary, to see the leaves turning, to be surrounded by leaves turning. It's not just the symbolism, it's the chance to confront in the death of the year your death, one blazing farewell appearance."
The Swing,"How do you like to go up in a swing, 
             Up in the air so blue? 
Oh, I do think it the pleasantest thing 
             Ever a child can do! 

Up in the air and over the wall, 
             Till I can see so wide, 
River and trees and cattle and all 
             Over the countryside—

Till I look down on the garden green, 
              Down on the roof so brown—
Up in the air I go flying again, 
              Up in the air and down!","""Up in the air and over the wall"" is one of the most popular songs of the 20th century. The song was written by the German children's writer Hans Hofmann in the 1930s and 1940s."
Nothing Gold Can Stay,"Nature’s first green is gold,
Her hardest hue to hold.
Her early leaf’s a flower;
But only so an hour.
Then leaf subsides to leaf.
So Eden sank to grief,
So dawn goes down to day.
Nothing gold can stay.","Nature's first green is gold, her hardest hue to hold. But only so an hour. Then leaf subsides to leaf. Eden sank to grief, so dawn goes down to day."
In Flanders Fields,"In Flanders fields the poppies blow
Between the crosses, row on row,
    That mark our place; and in the sky
    The larks, still bravely singing, fly
Scarce heard amid the guns below.
We are the Dead. Short days ago
We lived, felt dawn, saw sunset glow,
    Loved and were loved, and now we lie
        In Flanders fields.
Take up our quarrel with the foe: 
To you from failing hands we throw
    The torch; be yours to hold it high. 
    If ye break faith with us who die
We shall not sleep, though poppies grow
        In Flanders fields.","In Flanders fields the poppies blow between the crosses, row on row, that mark our place. The larks, still bravely singing, fly, heard amid the guns below."
I Hear an Army,"I hear an army charging upon the land,   
  And the thunder of horses plunging, foam about their knees:   
Arrogant, in black armour, behind them stand,   
  Disdaining the reins, with fluttering whips, the charioteers.   
   
They cry unto the night their battle-name:        
  I moan in sleep when I hear afar their whirling laughter.   
They cleave the gloom of dreams, a blinding flame,   
  Clanging, clanging upon the heart as upon an anvil.   
   
They come shaking in triumph their long, green hair:   
  They come out of the sea and run shouting by the shore. 
My heart, have you no wisdom thus to despair?   
  My love, my love, my love, why have you left me alone?","I hear an army charging upon the land, and the thunder of horses plunging, foam about their knees. I moan in sleep when I hear afar their whirling laughter. They cleave the gloom of dreams, a blinding flame."
"Wynken, Blynken, and Nod","Wynken, Blynken, and Nod one night
   Sailed off in a wooden shoe,—
Sailed on a river of crystal light
   Into a sea of dew.
""Where are you going, and what do you wish?""
   The old moon asked the three.
""We have come to fish for the herring-fish
   That live in this beautiful sea;
   Nets of silver and gold have we,""
            Said Wynken,
            Blynken,
            And Nod.
The old moon laughed and sang a song,
   As they rocked in the wooden shoe;
And the wind that sped them all night long
   Ruffled the waves of dew;
The little stars were the herring-fish
   That lived in the beautiful sea.
""Now cast your nets wherever you wish,—
   Never afraid are we!""
   So cried the stars to the fishermen three,
            Wynken,
            Blynken,
            And Nod.
All night long their nets they threw
   To the stars in the twinkling foam,—
Then down from the skies came the wooden shoe,
   Bringing the fishermen home:
'Twas all so pretty a sail, it seemed
   As if it could not be;
And some folk thought 'twas a dream they'd dreamed
   Of sailing that beautiful sea;
   But I shall name you the fishermen three:
            Wynken,
            Blynken,
            And Nod.
Wynken and Blynken are two little eyes,
   And Nod is a little head,
And the wooden shoe that sailed the skies
   Is a wee one's trundle-bed;
So shut your eyes while Mother sings
   Of wonderful sights that be,
And you shall see the beautiful things
   As you rock in the misty sea
   Where the old shoe rocked the fishermen three:—
            Wynken,
            Blynken,
            And Nod.","Wynken, Blynken, and Nod one night sailed off in a wooden shoe. The old moon laughed and sang a song. The fishermen three cast their nets wherever they wished."

Be Glad Your Nose Is on Your Face,"Be glad your nose is on your face,
not pasted on some other place,
for if it were where it is not,
you might dislike your nose a lot.
Imagine if your precious nose
were sandwiched in between your toes,
that clearly would not be a treat,
for you’d be forced to smell your feet.
Your nose would be a source of dread
were it attached atop your head,
it soon would drive you to despair,
forever tickled by your hair.
Within your ear, your nose would be
an absolute catastrophe,
for when you were obliged to sneeze,
your brain would rattle from the breeze.
Your nose, instead, through thick and thin,
remains between your eyes and chin,
not pasted on some other place—
be glad your nose is on your face!","Be glad your nose is on your face, not pasted on some other place. If it were where it is not, you might dislike your nose a lot."
At Pegasus,"They are like those crazy women 
   who tore Orpheus
      when he refused to sing,

these men grinding
   in the strobe & black lights
      of Pegasus. All shadow & sound.

""I'm just here for the music,"" 
   I tell the man who asks me
      to the floor. But I have held

a boy on my back before.
   Curtis & I used to leap
      barefoot into the creek; dance

among maggots & piss,
   beer bottles & tadpoles
      slippery as sperm;

we used to pull off our shirts, 
   & slap music into our skin.
      He wouldn't know me now
   
at the edge of these lovers' gyre, 
   glitter & steam, fire,
      bodies blurred sexless

by the music's spinning light.
   A young man slips his thumb
      into the mouth of an old one,

& I am not that far away.
   The whole scene raw & delicate 
      as Curtis's foot gashed

on a sunken bottle shard. 
   They press hip to hip,
      each breathless as a boy

carrying a friend on his back. 
   The foot swelling green
      as the sewage in that creek.

We never went back.
   But I remember his weight 
      better than I remember

my first kiss.
   These men know something
      I used to know.

How could I not find them
   beautiful, the way they dive & spill 
      into each other,

the way the dance floor
   takes them,
      wet & holy in its mouth.",Curtis & I used to leap into the creek barefoot. We used to pull off our shirts & slap music into our skin. We never went back. But I remember his weight better than I remember my first kiss.
Still I Rise,"You may write me down in history
With your bitter, twisted lies,
You may trod me in the very dirt
But still, like dust, I’ll rise.
Does my sassiness upset you?
Why are you beset with gloom?
’Cause I walk like I’ve got oil wells
Pumping in my living room.
Just like moons and like suns,
With the certainty of tides,
Just like hopes springing high,
Still I’ll rise.
Did you want to see me broken?
Bowed head and lowered eyes?
Shoulders falling down like teardrops,
Weakened by my soulful cries?
Does my haughtiness offend you?
Don’t you take it awful hard
’Cause I laugh like I’ve got gold mines
Diggin’ in my own backyard.
You may shoot me with your words,
You may cut me with your eyes,
You may kill me with your hatefulness,
But still, like air, I’ll rise.
Does my sexiness upset you?
Does it come as a surprise
That I dance like I’ve got diamonds
At the meeting of my thighs?
Out of the huts of history’s shame
I rise
Up from a past that’s rooted in pain
I rise
I’m a black ocean, leaping and wide,
Welling and swelling I bear in the tide.
Leaving behind nights of terror and fear
I rise
Into a daybreak that’s wondrously clear
I rise
Bringing the gifts that my ancestors gave,
I am the dream and the hope of the slave.
I rise

The New Colossus,"Not like the brazen giant of Greek fame,
With conquering limbs astride from land to land;
Here at our sea-washed, sunset gates shall stand
A mighty woman with a torch, whose flame
Is the imprisoned lightning, and her name
Mother of Exiles. From her beacon-hand
Glows world-wide welcome; her mild eyes command
The air-bridged harbor that twin cities frame.
“Keep, ancient lands, your storied pomp!” cries she
With silent lips. “Give me your tired, your poor,
Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free,
The wretched refuse of your teeming shore.
Send these, the homeless, tempest-tost to me,
I lift my lamp beside the golden door!”","A mighty woman with a torch, whose flame                Is the imprisoned lightning, and her name is Mother of Exiles. Not like the brazen giant of Greek fame, with conquering limbs astride from land to land."
Let America Be America Again,"Let America be America again.
Let it be the dream it used to be.
Let it be the pioneer on the plain
Seeking a home where he himself is free.
(America never was America to me.)
Let America be the dream the dreamers dreamed—
Let it be that great strong land of love
Where never kings connive nor tyrants scheme
That any man be crushed by one above.
(It never was America to me.)
O, let my land be a land where Liberty
Is crowned with no false patriotic wreath,
But opportunity is real, and life is free,
Equality is in the air we breathe.
(There’s never been equality for me,
Nor freedom in this “homeland of the free.”)
Say, who are you that mumbles in the dark?
And who are you that draws your veil across the stars?
I am the poor white, fooled and pushed apart,
I am the Negro bearing slavery’s scars.
I am the red man driven from the land,
I am the immigrant clutching the hope I seek—
And finding only the same old stupid plan
Of dog eat dog, of mighty crush the weak.
I am the young man, full of strength and hope,
Tangled in that ancient endless chain
Of profit, power, gain, of grab the land!
Of grab the gold! Of grab the ways of satisfying need!
Of work the men! Of take the pay!
Of owning everything for one’s own greed!
I am the farmer, bondsman to the soil.
I am the worker sold to the machine.
I am the Negro, servant to you all.
I am the people, humble, hungry, mean—
Hungry yet today despite the dream.
Beaten yet today—O, Pioneers!
I am the man who never got ahead,
The poorest worker bartered through the years.
Yet I’m the one who dreamt our basic dream
In the Old World while still a serf of kings,
Who dreamt a dream so strong, so brave, so true,
That even yet its mighty daring sings
In every brick and stone, in every furrow turned
That’s made America the land it has become.
O, I’m the man who sailed those early seas
In search of what I meant to be my home—
For I’m the one who left dark Ireland’s shore,
And Poland’s plain, and England’s grassy lea,
And torn from Black Africa’s strand I came
To build a “homeland of the free.”
The free?
Who said the free? Not me?
Surely not me? The millions on relief today?
The millions shot down when we strike?
The millions who have nothing for our pay?
For all the dreams we’ve dreamed
And all the songs we’ve sung
And all the hopes we’ve held
And all the flags we’ve hung,
The millions who have nothing for our pay—
Except the dream that’s almost dead today.
O, let America be America again—
The land that never has been yet—
And yet must be—the land where every man is free.
The land that’s mine—the poor man’s, Indian’s, Negro’s, ME—
Who made America,
Whose sweat and blood, whose faith and pain,
Whose hand at the foundry, whose plow in the rain,
Must bring back our mighty dream again.
Sure, call me any ugly name you choose—
The steel of freedom does not stain.
From those who live like leeches on the people’s lives,
We must take back our land again,
America!
O, yes,
I say it plain,
America never was America to me,
And yet I swear this oath—
America will be!
Out of the rack and ruin of our gangster death,
The rape and rot of graft, and stealth, and lies,
We, the people, must redeem
The land, the mines, the plants, the rivers.
The mountains and the endless plain—
All, all the stretch of these great green states—
And make America again!","Pioneer: ""America never was America to me."" ""Let America be the dream the dreamers dreamed,"" he says. ""We must take back our land again, America!"" ""We will redeem the land, the mines, the mountains and the rivers"""
Notes from the Other Side,"I divested myself of despair
and fear when I came here.

Now there is no more catching
one's own eye in the mirror,

there are no bad books, no plastic,
no insurance premiums, and of course

no illness. Contrition 
does not exist, nor gnashing

of teeth. No one howls as the first
clod of earth hits the casket.

The poor we no longer have with us. 
Our calm hearts strike only the hour,

and God, as promised, proves
to be mercy clothed in light.","I divested myself of despairand fear when I came here. I have no more catching my own eye in the mirror.

The Splendid Body,"The splendid body is meat, flexor
and flesh pumping, pulling, anti-
gravity maverick just standing
upright all over museums and
in line for the bus and in the laundry
aisle where it’s just standing there
smelling all the detergent like
it’s no big deal. So what if a couple
of its squishy parts are suspended
within, like beach-bungled jellyfish
in a shelved jar, not doing anything?
Nothing on this side of the quantum
tunnel is perfect. The splendid body,
though, is splendid in the way
it keeps its steamy blood in, no matter
how bad it blushes. And splendid
in how it opens its mouth and
these invisible vibrations come
rippling out—if you put your wrist
right up to it when that happens
it feels somewhat like the feet
of many bees. The splendid body
loves the juniper smell of gin, loves
the warmth of printer-fresh paper,
and the sound fallen leaves make
under the wheel of a turning car.
If you touch it between the legs,
the splendid body will quicken
like bubbles in a just-on teakettle.
It knows it can’t exist forever, so
it’s collecting as many flavors as it can—
saffron, rainwater, fish-skin, chive.
Do not distract it from its purpose,
which is to feel everything it can find.","The splendid body is meat, flexor                and flesh pumping, pulling, anti-gravity maverick.

Dream Nest,"More like a basket

Then I knew:
            a human lived there.
And once I knew—
            the nest, nearly

Chickens,"I come from hay and barns, raising 
chickens. In spring, lambs come. 
You got to get up, fly early, do the orphan run

When the electricity shuts off, you boil water, you crack ice. 
You keep the animals watered. 
You walk through the barn, through the hay smell,
your hair brittle where you chopped it with scissors 
same ones you use for everything. Your sweater has holes. 
When you feed the ram lambs, you say goodbye. 
Summer, choke cherries; your mouth’s dry. Apples, cider. 
Corn picking. Canning for weeks that feel like years. 
Chopping heads off quail, rabbits, chickens. 
You can pluck a chicken, gut it fast. 
You find unformed eggs, unformed chicks. 
They start chirping day nineteen. 
You make biscuits and gravy for hundred kids 
serve them up good. You’re the chick 
who never got past day nineteen, never found your chick voice. 
You make iced tea. They say, you’re a soldier in the king’s army. 
At night, you say to yourself, Kathy, someday. 
We go walking. We go talking. We find a big story. 
A cracking egg story. A walking girl story. 
A walking out of the woods story. A not slapped silly story. 
A not Jesus story. Hush, Kathy you say, we get out of here. 
We find out where chicks go when they learn to fly.","I come from hay and barns, raising chickens. In spring, lambs come. In summer, choke cherries; your mouth’s dry. Canning for weeks that feel like years."

Poem,"(To F. S.)
I loved my friend. 
He went away from me. 
There’s nothing more to say. 
The poem ends, 
Soft as it began,—
I loved my friend. ","I loved my friend. He went away from me. There’s nothing more to say. (To F. S.) The poem ends,                 Soft as it"
Macavity: The Mystery Cat,"Macavity’s a Mystery Cat: he’s called the Hidden Paw—
For he’s the master criminal who can defy the Law.
He’s the bafflement of Scotland Yard, the Flying Squad’s despair:
For when they reach the scene of crime—Macavity’s not there!
Macavity, Macavity, there’s no one like Macavity,
He’s broken every human law, he breaks the law of gravity.
His powers of levitation would make a fakir stare,
And when you reach the scene of crime—Macavity’s not there!
You may seek him in the basement, you may look up in the air—
But I tell you once and once again, Macavity’s not there!
Macavity’s a ginger cat, he’s very tall and thin;
You would know him if you saw him, for his eyes are sunken in.
His brow is deeply lined with thought, his head is highly domed;
His coat is dusty from neglect, his whiskers are uncombed.
He sways his head from side to side, with movements like a snake;
And when you think he’s half asleep, he’s always wide awake.
Macavity, Macavity, there’s no one like Macavity,
For he’s a fiend in feline shape, a monster of depravity.
You may meet him in a by-street, you may see him in the square—
But when a crime’s discovered, then Macavity’s not there!
He’s outwardly respectable. (They say he cheats at cards.)
And his footprints are not found in any file of Scotland Yard’s.
And when the larder’s looted, or the jewel-case is rifled,
Or when the milk is missing, or another Peke’s been stifled,
Or the greenhouse glass is broken, and the trellis past repair—
Ay, there’s the wonder of the thing! Macavity’s not there!
And when the Foreign Office find a Treaty’s gone astray,
Or the Admiralty lose some plans and drawings by the way,
There may be a scrap of paper in the hall or on the stair—
But it’s useless to investigate—Macavity’s not there!
And when the loss has been disclosed, the Secret Service say:
‘It must have been Macavity!’—but he’s a mile away.
You’ll be sure to find him resting, or a-licking of his thumbs;
Or engaged in doing complicated long division sums.
Macavity, Macavity, there’s no one like Macavity,
There never was a Cat of such deceitfulness and suavity.
He always has an alibi, and one or two to spare:
At whatever time the deed took place—MACAVITY WASN’T THERE!
And they say that all the Cats whose wicked deeds are widely known
(I might mention Mungojerrie, I might mention Griddlebone)
Are nothing more than agents for the Cat who all the time
Just controls their operations: the Napoleon of Crime!","Macavity is the master criminal who can defy the Law. He’s broken every human law, he breaks the law of gravity. His powers of levitation would make a fakir stare. He always has an alibi, and one or two."
"Song of Myself, 51","The past and present wilt—I have fill'd them, emptied them.
And proceed to fill my next fold of the future.
Listener up there! what have you to confide to me?
Look in my face while I snuff the sidle of evening,
(Talk honestly, no one else hears you, and I stay only a minute longer.)
Do I contradict myself?
Very well then I contradict myself,
(I am large, I contain multitudes.)
I concentrate toward them that are nigh, I wait on the door-slab.
Who has done his day's work? who will soonest be through with his supper?
Who wishes to walk with me?
Will you speak before I am gone? will you prove already too late?","The writer asks: ""What have you to confide to me?"" He then asks the listener: ""Will you speak before I am gone?"""
On Friendship,"And a youth said, Speak to us of Friendship.
    And he answered, saying:
    Your friend is your needs answered.
    He is your field which you sow with love and reap with thanksgiving.
    And he is your board and your fireside.
    For you come to him with your hunger, and you seek him for peace.
    When your friend speaks his mind you fear not the “nay” in your own mind, nor do you withhold the “ay.”
    And when he is silent your heart ceases not to listen to his heart;
    For without words, in friendship, all thoughts, all desires, all expectations are born and shared, with joy that is unacclaimed.
    When you part from your friend, you grieve not;
    For that which you love most in him may be clearer in his absence, as the mountain to the climber is clearer from the plain.
    And let there be no purpose in friendship save the deepening of the spirit.
    For love that seeks aught but the disclosure of its own mystery us not love but a net cast forth: and only the unprofitable is caught.
    And let your best be for your friend.
    If he must know the ebb of your tide, let him know its flood also.
    For what is your friend that you should seek him with hours to kill?
    Seek him always with hours to live.
    For it is his to fill your need but not your emptiness.
    And in the sweetness of friendship let there be laughter, and sharing of pleasures.
    For in the dew of little things the heart finds its morning and is refreshed.","In friendship, all thoughts, all desires, all expectations are born and shared, with joy that is unacclaimed. When you part from your friend, you grieve not; that which you love most in him may be clearer in his absence."
Wind and Window Flower,"Lovers, forget your love,
     And list to the love of these,
She a window flower,
     And he a winter breeze.

When the frosty window veil
     Was melted down at noon,
And the cagèd yellow bird
     Hung over her in tune,

He marked her through the pane,
     He could not help but mark,
And only passed her by,
     To come again at dark.

He was a winter wind,
     Concerned with ice and snow,
Dead weeds and unmated birds,
     And little of love could know.

But he sighed upon the sill,
     He gave the sash a shake,
As witness all within
     Who lay that night awake.

Perchance he half prevailed
     To win her for the flight
From the firelit looking-glass
     And warm stove-window light.

But the flower leaned aside
     And thought of naught to say,
And morning found the breeze
     A hundred miles away.","She was a window flower, and he was a winter breeze. Lovers, forget your love, and list to the love of these."
My November Guest,"My sorrow, when she’s here with me,
     Thinks these dark days of autumn rain
Are beautiful as days can be;
She loves the bare, the withered tree;
     She walks the sodden pasture lane.
Her pleasure will not let me stay.
     She talks and I am fain to list:
She’s glad the birds are gone away,
She’s glad her simple worsted grey
     Is silver now with clinging mist.
The desolate, deserted trees,
     The faded earth, the heavy sky,
The beauties she so truly sees,
She thinks I have no eye for these,
     And vexes me for reason why.
Not yesterday I learned to know
     The love of bare November days
Before the coming of the snow,
But it were vain to tell her so,
     And they are better for her praise.","My sorrow, when she’s here with me, thinks these dark days of autumn rain are beautiful as days can be. She loves the bare, the withered tree; she walks the sodden pasture lane. Her pleasure will not let me stay."
Kissing in Vietnamese,"My grandmother kisses
as if bombs are bursting in the backyard,
where mint and jasmine lace their perfumes
through the kitchen window,
as if somewhere, a body is falling apart
and flames are making their way back
through the intricacies of a young boy’s thigh,
as if to walk out the door, your torso
would dance from exit wounds.
When my grandmother kisses, there would be
no flashy smooching, no western music
of pursed lips, she kisses as if to breathe
you inside her, nose pressed to cheek
so that your scent is relearned
and your sweat pearls into drops of gold
inside her lungs, as if while she holds you
death also, is clutching your wrist.
My grandmother kisses as if history
never ended, as if somewhere
a body is still
falling apart.","When my grandmother kisses, there would be no flashy smooching, no western music. She kisses as if to breathe you inside her, nose pressed to cheek, sweat pearls into drops of gold."
Perhaps the World Ends Here,"The world begins at a kitchen table. No matter what, we must eat to live.
The gifts of earth are brought and prepared, set on the table. So it has been since creation, and it will go on.
We chase chickens or dogs away from it. Babies teethe at the corners. They scrape their knees under it.
It is here that children are given instructions on what it means to be human. We make men at it, we make women.
At this table we gossip, recall enemies and the ghosts of lovers.
Our dreams drink coffee with us as they put their arms around our children. They laugh with us at our poor falling-down selves and as we put ourselves back together once again at the table.
This table has been a house in the rain, an umbrella in the sun.
Wars have begun and ended at this table. It is a place to hide in the shadow of terror. A place to celebrate the terrible victory.
We have given birth on this table, and have prepared our parents for burial here.
At this table we sing with joy, with sorrow. We pray of suffering and remorse. We give thanks.
Perhaps the world will end at the kitchen table, while we are laughing and crying, eating of the last sweet bite.","The world begins at a kitchen table. No matter what, we must eat to live. The gifts of earth are brought and prepared, set on the table. So it has been since creation, and it will go on."

Silence,"My father used to say,
""Superior people never make long visits,
have to be shown Longfellow's grave
or the glass flowers at Harvard.
Self-reliant like the cat—
that takes its prey to privacy,
the mouse's limp tail hanging like a shoelace from its mouth—
they sometimes enjoy solitude,
and can be robbed of speech
by speech which has delighted them.
The deepest feeling always shows itself in silence;
not in silence, but restraint.""
Nor was he insincere in saying, ""Make my house your inn.""
Inns are not residences.","Superior people never make long visits to Longfellow's grave or the glass flowers at Harvard. The deepest feeling always shows itself in silence; not in silence, but restraint."
Having a Coke with You,"is even more fun than going to San Sebastian, Irún, Hendaye, Biarritz, Bayonne
or being sick to my stomach on the Travesera de Gracia in Barcelona
partly because in your orange shirt you look like a better happier St. Sebastian
partly because of my love for you, partly because of your love for yoghurt
partly because of the fluorescent orange tulips around the birches
partly because of the secrecy our smiles take on before people and statuary
it is hard to believe when I’m with you that there can be anything as still
as solemn as unpleasantly definitive as statuary when right in front of it
in the warm New York 4 o’clock light we are drifting back and forth

and the portrait show seems to have no faces in it at all, just paint

at a rehearsal a single drawing of Leonardo or Michelangelo that used to wow me

or for that matter Marino Marini when he didn’t pick the rider as carefully
as the horse

The Change,"The season turned like the page of a glossy fashion magazine. 
In the park the daffodils came up 
and in the parking lot, the new car models were on parade.

Sometimes I think that nothing really changes—

The young girls show the latest crop of tummies, 
        and the new president proves that he's a dummy.

But remember the tennis match we watched that year? 
Right before our eyes

some tough little European blonde 
pitted against that big black girl from Alabama, 
cornrowed hair and Zulu bangles on her arms, 
some outrageous name like Vondella Aphrodite—

We were just walking past the lounge 
     and got sucked in by the screen above the bar, 
and pretty soon 
we started to care about who won,

putting ourselves into each whacked return 
as the volleys went back and forth and back 
like some contest between 
the old world and the new,

and you loved her complicated hair 
and her to-hell-with-everybody stare, 
and I, 
         I couldn't help wanting
the white girl to come out on top, 
because she was one of my kind, my tribe, 
with her pale eyes and thin lips

and because the black girl was so big 
and so black, 
                        so unintimidated,

hitting the ball like she was driving the Emancipation Proclamation 
down Abraham Lincoln's throat, 
like she wasn't asking anyone's permission.

There are moments when history 
passes you so close 
                you can smell its breath, 
you can reach your hand out 
                                    and touch it on its flank,

and I don't watch all that much Masterpiece Theatre, 
but I could feel the end of an era there

in front of those bleachers full of people 
in their Sunday tennis-watching clothes

as that black girl wore down her opponent 
then kicked her ass good 
then thumped her once more for good measure

and stood up on the red clay court 
holding her racket over her head like a guitar.

And the little pink judge 
                          had to climb up on a box 
to put the ribbon on her neck, 
still managing to smile into the camera flash, 
even though everything was changing

and in fact, everything had already changed—

Poof, remember? It was the twentieth century almost gone, 
we were there,

and when we went to put it back where it belonged, 
it was past us 
and we were changed.
  Listen to Claudia Rankine respond to Hoagland's poem >",The poem was written by Claudia Rankine for the BBC's Radio 4 Today programme. Rankine was inspired by a tennis match between a white girl and a black girl. Hoagland says he could feel the end of an era as he watched the match.
Antigonish [I met a man who wasn't there],"Yesterday, upon the stair,
I met a man who wasn't there
He wasn't there again today
I wish, I wish he'd go away...
When I came home last night at three
The man was waiting there for me
But when I looked around the hall
I couldn't see him there at all!
Go away, go away, don't you come back any more!
Go away, go away, and please don't slam the door... (slam!)
Last night I saw upon the stair
A little man who wasn't there
He wasn't there again today
Oh, how I wish he'd go away...","""I wish, I wish he'd go away... (slam!) "" is a poem written by a young woman about a man she met on the stair. ""Go away, go away, don't you come back any more!"" is a song about a missing man."

Sharks in the Rivers,"We'll say unbelievable things 
to each other in the early morning— 
  
our blue coming up from our roots, 
our water rising in our extraordinary limbs. 
  
All night I dreamt of bonfires and burn piles 
and ghosts of men, and spirits 
behind those birds of flame. 
  
I cannot tell anymore when a door opens or closes, 
I can only hear the frame saying, Walk through. 
  
It is a short walkway— 
into another bedroom. 
  
Consider the handle. Consider the key. 
  
I say to a friend, how scared I am of sharks. 
  
How I thought I saw them in the creek 
across from my street. 
  
I once watched for them, holding a bundle 
of rattlesnake grass in my hand, 
shaking like a weak-leaf girl. 
  
She sends me an article from a recent National Geographic that says, 
  
Sharks bite fewer people each year than 
New Yorkers do, according to Health Department records. 
  
Then she sends me on my way. Into the City of Sharks. 
  
Through another doorway, I walk to the East River saying, 
  
Sharks are people too. 
Sharks are people too. 
Sharks are people too. 
  
I write all the things I need on the bottom 
of my tennis shoes. I say, Let's walk together. 
  
The sun behind me is like a fire. 
Tiny flames in the river's ripples. 
  
I say something to God, but he's not a living thing, 
so I say it to the river, I say, 
  
I want to walk through this doorway 
But without all those ghosts on the edge, 
I want them to stay here. 
I want them to go on without me. 
  
I want them to burn in the water.","The book is called ""The City of Sharks"" and is published by Simon & Schuster. The book is published in hardback and is available on Kindle."
"Romeo and Juliet, Act III, Scene II [Gallop apace, you fiery-footed steeds]","Juliet waits for nightfall when Romeo will return.

Juliet: Gallop apace, you fiery-footed steeds,
Towards Phoebus' lodging: such a waggoner
As Phaethon would whip you to the west,
And bring in cloudy night immediately.
Spread thy close curtain, love-performing night,
That runaway's eyes may wink and Romeo
Leap to these arms, untalk'd of and unseen.
Lovers can see to do their amorous rites
By their own beauties; or, if love be blind,
It best agrees with night. Come, civil night,
Thou sober-suited matron, all in black,
And learn me how to lose a winning match,
Play'd for a pair of stainless maidenhoods.
Hood my unmann'd blood bating in my cheeks
With thy black mantle, till strange love grown bold
Think true love acted simple modesty.
Come, night, come, Romeo, come, thou day in night;
For thou wilt lie upon the wings of night
Whiter than new snow on a raven's back.
Come, gentle night, come, loving, black-brow'd night,
Give me my Romeo; and, when he shall die,
Take him and cut him out in little stars,
And he will make the face of heaven so fine
That all the world will be in love with night
And pay no worship to the garish sun.
O, I have bought the mansion of a love,
But not possess'd it, and, though I am sold,
Not yet enjoy'd: so tedious is this day
As is the night before some festival
To an impatient child that hath new robes
And may not wear them. O, here comes my nurse,
And she brings news, and every tongue that speaks
But Romeo's name speaks heavenly eloquence.","Juliet waits for nightfall when Romeo will return to her. Romeo's name speaks heavenly eloquence, says the poet. Juliet is a sober-suited matron, all in black, says Shakespeare."

Dream-Land,"By a route obscure and lonely,
Haunted by ill angels only,
Where an Eidolon, named NIGHT,
On a black throne reigns upright,
I have reached these lands but newly
From an ultimate dim Thule—
From a wild clime that lieth, sublime,
            Out of SPACE— out of TIME.

Bottomless vales and boundless floods,
And chasms, and caves, and Titan woods,
With forms that no man can discover
For the tears that drip all over;
Mountains toppling evermore
Into seas without a shore;
Seas that restlessly aspire,
Surging, unto skies of fire;
Lakes that endlessly outspread
Their lone waters— lone and dead,—
Their still waters— still and chilly
With the snows of the lolling lily.

By the lakes that thus outspread
Their lone waters, lone and dead,—
Their sad waters, sad and chilly
With the snows of the lolling lily,—
By the mountains— near the river
Murmuring lowly, murmuring ever,—
By the grey woods,— by the swamp
Where the toad and the newt encamp—
By the dismal tarns and pools


     Where dwell the Ghouls,—
By each spot the most unholy—
In each nook most melancholy—
There the traveller meets aghast
Sheeted Memories of the Past—
Shrouded forms that start and sigh
As they pass the wanderer by—
White—robed forms of friends long given,
In agony, to the Earth— and Heaven.

For the heart whose woes are legion
'Tis a peaceful, soothing region—
For the spirit that walks in shadow
'Tis— oh, 'tis an Eldorado!
But the traveller, travelling through it,
May not— dare not openly view it!
Never its mysteries are exposed
To the weak human eye unclosed;
So wills its King, who hath forbid
The uplifting of the fringed lid;
And thus the sad Soul that here passes
Beholds it but through darkened glasses.

By a route obscure and lonely,
Haunted by ill angels only,
Where an Eidolon, named NIGHT,
On a black throne reigns upright,
I have wandered home but newly
From this ultimate dim Thule.","From a wild clime that lieth, sublime, out of SPACE— out of TIME. By a route obscure and lonely,Haunted by ill angels only. An Eidolon, named NIGHT, on a black throne reigns upright."
Childe Harold's Pilgrimage [There is a pleasure in the pathless woods],"   There is a pleasure in the pathless woods,
   There is a rapture on the lonely shore,
   There is society where none intrudes,
   By the deep Sea, and music in its roar:
   I love not Man the less, but Nature more,
   From these our interviews, in which I steal
   From all I may be, or have been before,
   To mingle with the Universe, and feel
What I can ne'er express, yet cannot all conceal.
   Roll on, thou deep and dark blue Ocean--roll!
   Ten thousand fleets sweep over thee in vain;
   Man marks the earth with ruin--his control
   Stops with the shore;--upon the watery plain
   The wrecks are all thy deed, nor doth remain
   A shadow of man's ravage, save his own,
   When for a moment, like a drop of rain,
   He sinks into thy depths with bubbling groan,
Without a grave, unknelled, uncoffined, and unknown.
   His steps are not upon thy paths,--thy fields
   Are not a spoil for him,--thou dost arise
   And shake him from thee; the vile strength he wields
   For earth's destruction thou dost all despise,
   Spurning him from thy bosom to the skies,
   And send'st him, shivering in thy playful spray
   And howling, to his gods, where haply lies
   His petty hope in some near port or bay,
And dashest him again to earth: —there let him lay.","""I love not Man the less, but Nature more,"" he writes. ""There is a pleasure in the pathless woods, and a rapture on the lonely shore"""
Such Is the Sickness of Many a Good Thing,"Was he then Adam of the Burning Way? 
hid away in the heat like wrath

word.        For into a dark

for the enlightening, the

only this one quick in time, 
        this one start 
when its moment is true. 


Such is the sickness of many a good thing 
that now into my life from long ago this 
refusing to say I love you has bound 
the weeping, the yielding, the 
        yearning to be taken again, 
into a knot, a waiting, a string

it resists the touch. It grows dark

Half a league onward,
All in the valley of Death
Rode the six hundred.
""Forward, the Light Brigade!
Charge for the guns!"" he said:
Into the valley of Death
Rode the six hundred.

""Forward, the Light Brigade!""
Was there a man dismay’d?
Not tho’ the soldier knew
Some one had blunder’d:
Theirs not to make reply,
Theirs not to reason why,
Theirs but to do and die:
Into the valley of Death
Rode the six hundred.

Cannon to right of them,
Cannon to left of them,
Cannon in front of them
Volley’d and thunder’d;
Storm’d at with shot and shell,
Boldly they rode and well,
Into the jaws of Death,
Into the mouth of Hell
Rode the six hundred.

Flash’d all their sabres bare,
Flash’d as they turn’d in air
Sabring the gunners there,
Charging an army, while
All the world wonder’d:
Plunged in the battery-smoke
Right thro’ the line they broke;
Cossack and Russian
Reel’d from the sabre-stroke
Shatter’d and sunder’d.
Then they rode back, but not
Not the six hundred.

Cannon to right of them,
Cannon to left of them,
Cannon behind them
Volley’d and thunder’d;
Storm’d at with shot and shell,
While horse and hero fell,
They that had fought so well
Came thro’ the jaws of Death,
Back from the mouth of Hell,
All that was left of them,
Left of six hundred.

When can their glory fade?
O the wild charge they made!
All the world wonder’d.
Honor the charge they made!
Honor the Light Brigade,
Noble six hundred!","""Forward, the Light Brigade!"" he said: ""Charge for the guns!"" The six hundred rode into the valley of Death. They broke the line they broke; Cossack and RussianReel’d from the sabre-stroke."

Do not go gentle into that good night,"Do not go gentle into that good night,
Old age should burn and rave at close of day;
Rage, rage against the dying of the light.

Though wise men at their end know dark is right,
Because their words had forked no lightning they
Do not go gentle into that good night.

Good men, the last wave by, crying how bright
Their frail deeds might have danced in a green bay,
Rage, rage against the dying of the light.

Wild men who caught and sang the sun in flight,
And learn, too late, they grieved it on its way,

Grave men, near death, who see with blinding sight
Blind eyes could blaze like meteors and be gay,
Rage, rage against the dying of the light.

Curse, bless, me now with your fierce tears, I pray.

Her Kind,"I have gone out, a possessed witch,
haunting the black air, braver at night;
dreaming evil, I have done my hitch
over the plain houses, light by light:
lonely thing, twelve-fingered, out of mind.
A woman like that is not a woman, quite.
I have been her kind.
I have found the warm caves in the woods,
filled them with skillets, carvings, shelves,
closets, silks, innumerable goods;
fixed the suppers for the worms and the elves:
whining, rearranging the disaligned.
A woman like that is misunderstood.
I have been her kind.
I have ridden in your cart, driver,
waved my nude arms at villages going by,
learning the last bright routes, survivor
where your flames still bite my thigh
and my ribs crack where your wheels wind.

Because I could not stop for Death (479),"Because I could not stop for Death—
He kindly stopped for me—
The Carriage held but just Ourselves— 
And Immortality.
We slowly drove—He knew no haste
And I had put away
My labor and my leisure too,
For His Civility—
We passed the School, where Children strove
At Recess—in the Ring—
We passed the Fields of Gazing Grain—
We passed the Setting Sun—
Or rather—He passed us—
The Dews drew quivering and chill—
For only Gossamer, my Gown—
My Tippet—only Tulle—
We paused before a House that seemed
A Swelling of the Ground—
The Roof was scarcely visible—
The Cornice—in the Ground—
Since then—’tis Centuries—and yet
Feels shorter than the Day
I first surmised the Horses’ Heads
Were toward Eternity—","Because I could not stop for Death, he kindly stopped for me. The Carriage held but just Ourselves—                 And Immortality. The Roof was scarcely visible. The Cornice—in the Ground."
Ode to the West Wind,"  I
  O wild West Wind, thou breath of Autumn’s being,
Thou, from whose unseen presence the leaves dead
Are driven, like ghosts from an enchanter fleeing,
  Yellow, and black, and pale, and hectic red,
Pestilence-stricken multitudes: O thou,
Who chariotest to their dark wintry bed
The wingèd seeds, where they lie cold and low,
Each like a corpse within its grave, until
Thine azure sister of the Spring shall blow
Her clarion o’er the dreaming earth, and fill
(Driving sweet buds like flocks to feed in air)
With living hues and odours plain and hill:
Wild Spirit, which art moving everywhere;
Destroyer and Preserver; hear, O hear!
  II
  Thou on whose stream, ‘mid the steep sky’s commotion,
Loose clouds like Earth’s decaying leaves are shed,
Shook from the tangled boughs of Heaven and Ocean,
  Angels of rain and lightning: there are spread
On the blue surface of thine airy surge,
Like the bright hair uplifted from the head
Of some fierce Maenad, even from the dim verge
Of the horizon to the zenith’s height,
The locks of the approaching storm. Thou dirge
Of the dying year, to which this closing night
Will be the dome of a vast sepulchre
Vaulted with all thy congregated might
Of vapours, from whose solid atmosphere
Black rain, and fire, and hail will burst: O hear!
  III
  Thou who didst waken from his summer dreams
The blue Mediterranean, where he lay,
Lulled by the coil of his crystalline streams,
  Beside a pumice isle in Baiae’s bay,
And saw in sleep old palaces and towers
Quivering within the wave's intenser day,
All overgrown with azure moss and flowers
So sweet, the sense faints picturing them! Thou
For whose path the Atlantic’s level powers
Cleave themselves into chasms, while far below
The sea-blooms and the oozy woods which wear
The sapless foliage of the ocean, know
Thy voice, and suddenly grow grey with fear,
And tremble and despoil themselves: O hear!
  IV
  If I were a dead leaf thou mightest bear;
If I were a swift cloud to fly with thee;
A wave to pant beneath thy power, and share
  The impulse of thy strength, only less free
Than thou, O Uncontrollable! If even
I were as in my boyhood, and could be
The comrade of thy wanderings over Heaven,
As then, when to outstrip thy skiey speed
Scarce seemed a vision; I would ne’er have striven
As thus with thee in prayer in my sore need.
Oh! lift me as a wave, a leaf, a cloud!
I fall upon the thorns of life! I bleed!
A heavy weight of hours has chained and bowed
One too like thee: tameless, and swift, and proud.
  V
  Make me thy lyre, even as the forest is:
What if my leaves are falling like its own!
The tumult of thy mighty harmonies
  Will take from both a deep, autumnal tone,
Sweet though in sadness. Be thou, Spirit fierce,
My spirit! Be thou me, impetuous one!
Drive my dead thoughts over the universe
Like withered leaves to quicken a new birth!
And, by the incantation of this verse,
Scatter, as from an unextinguished hearth
Ashes and sparks, my words among mankind!
Be through my lips to unawakened Earth
The trumpet of a prophecy! O Wind,
If Winter comes, can Spring be far behind?","O wild West Wind, thou breath of Autumn’s being. O thou, from whose unseen presence the leaves dead are driven, like ghosts from an enchanter fleeing. Yellow, and black, and pale, and hectic red, plague the world."
Wanting to Die,"Since you ask, most days I cannot remember.
I walk in my clothing, unmarked by that voyage.
Then the almost unnameable lust returns.
Even then I have nothing against life.
I know well the grass blades you mention,
the furniture you have placed under the sun.
But suicides have a special language.
Like carpenters they want to know which tools.
They never ask why build.
Twice I have so simply declared myself,
have possessed the enemy, eaten the enemy,
have taken on his craft, his magic.
In this way, heavy and thoughtful,
warmer than oil or water,
I have rested, drooling at the mouth-hole.
I did not think of my body at needle point.
Even the cornea and the leftover urine were gone.
Suicides have already betrayed the body.
Still-born, they don't always die,
but dazzled, they can't forget a drug so sweet
that even children would look on and smile.
To thrust all that life under your tongue!--
that, all by itself, becomes a passion.
Death's a sad Bone; bruised, you'd say,
and yet she waits for me, year after year,
to so delicately undo an old wound,
to empty my breath from its bad prison.
Balanced there, suicides sometimes meet,
raging at the fruit, a pumped-up moon,
leaving the bread they mistook for a kiss,
leaving the page of the book carelessly open,
something unsaid, the phone off the hook
and the love, whatever it was, an infection.","Suicides have a special language. Since you ask, most days most days I cannot remember. Then the almost unnameable lust returns. Even the cornea and the leftover urine were gone."
How Do I Love Thee? (Sonnet 43),"How do I love thee? Let me count the ways.
I love thee to the depth and breadth and height
My soul can reach, when feeling out of sight
For the ends of being and ideal grace.
I love thee to the level of every day’s
Most quiet need, by sun and candle-light.
I love thee freely, as men strive for right.
I love thee purely, as they turn from praise.
I love thee with the passion put to use
In my old griefs, and with my childhood’s faith.
I love thee with a love I seemed to lose
With my lost saints. I love thee with the breath,
Smiles, tears, of all my life; and, if God choose,
I shall but love thee better after death.","I love thee to the level of every day’s quiet need, by sun and candle-light. I love thee with the passion put to use in my old griefs, and with my childhood's faith. And, if God choose, I shall but love thee better after death."
Casey at the Bat,"The outlook wasn't brilliant for the Mudville nine that day:
The score stood four to two, with but one inning more to play,
And then when Cooney died at first, and Barrows did the same,
A pall-like silence fell upon the patrons of the game.
A straggling few got up to go in deep despair. The rest
Clung to the hope which springs eternal in the human breast;
They thought, ""If only Casey could but get a whack at that—
We'd put up even money now, with Casey at the bat.""
But Flynn preceded Casey, as did also Jimmy Blake,
And the former was a hoodoo, while the latter was a cake;
So upon that stricken multitude grim melancholy sat,
For there seemed but little chance of Casey getting to the bat.
But Flynn let drive a single, to the wonderment of all,
And Blake, the much despisèd, tore the cover off the ball;
And when the dust had lifted, and men saw what had occurred,
There was Jimmy safe at second and Flynn a-hugging third.
Then from five thousand throats and more there rose a lusty yell;
It rumbled through the valley, it rattled in the dell;
It pounded on the mountain and recoiled upon the flat,
For Casey, mighty Casey, was advancing to the bat.
There was ease in Casey's manner as he stepped into his place;
There was pride in Casey's bearing and a smile lit Casey's face.
And when, responding to the cheers, he lightly doffed his hat,
No stranger in the crowd could doubt 'twas Casey at the bat.
Ten thousand eyes were on him as he rubbed his hands with dirt;
Five thousand tongues applauded when he wiped them on his shirt;
Then while the writhing pitcher ground the ball into his hip,
Defiance flashed in Casey's eye, a sneer curled Casey's lip.
And now the leather-covered sphere came hurtling through the air,
And Casey stood a-watching it in haughty grandeur there.
Close by the sturdy batsman the ball unheeded sped—
""That ain't my style,"" said Casey. ""Strike one!"" the umpire said.
From the benches, black with people, there went up a muffled roar,
Like the beating of the storm-waves on a stern and distant shore;
""Kill him! Kill the umpire!"" shouted someone on the stand;
And it's likely they'd have killed him had not Casey raised his hand.
With a smile of Christian charity great Casey's visage shone;
He stilled the rising tumult; he bade the game go on;
He signaled to the pitcher, and once more the dun sphere flew;
But Casey still ignored it and the umpire said, ""Strike two!""
""Fraud!"" cried the maddened thousands, and echo answered ""Fraud!""
But one scornful look from Casey and the audience was awed.
They saw his face grow stern and cold, they saw his muscles strain,
And they knew that Casey wouldn't let that ball go by again.
The sneer is gone from Casey's lip, his teeth are clenched in hate,
He pounds with cruel violence his bat upon the plate;
And now the pitcher holds the ball, and now he lets it go,
And now the air is shattered by the force of Casey's blow.
Oh, somewhere in this favoured land the sun is shining bright,
The band is playing somewhere, and somewhere hearts are light;
And somewhere men are laughing, and somewhere children shout,
But there is no joy in Mudville—mighty Casey has struck out.","The Mudville nine were down four to two with one inning to play when Cooney and Barrows died. Casey, the mighty batsman, was advancing to the bat. The umpire said, ""Strike one!"" and Casey ignored it. The crowd roared, and Casey raised his hand and struck out."
As I Walked Out One Evening,"As I walked out one evening,
   Walking down Bristol Street,
The crowds upon the pavement
   Were fields of harvest wheat.
And down by the brimming river
   I heard a lover sing
Under an arch of the railway:
   ‘Love has no ending.
‘I’ll love you, dear, I’ll love you
   Till China and Africa meet,
And the river jumps over the mountain
   And the salmon sing in the street,
‘I’ll love you till the ocean
   Is folded and hung up to dry
And the seven stars go squawking
   Like geese about the sky.
‘The years shall run like rabbits,
   For in my arms I hold
The Flower of the Ages,
   And the first love of the world.’
But all the clocks in the city
   Began to whirr and chime:
‘O let not Time deceive you,
   You cannot conquer Time.
‘In the burrows of the Nightmare
   Where Justice naked is,
Time watches from the shadow
   And coughs when you would kiss.
‘In headaches and in worry
   Vaguely life leaks away,
And Time will have his fancy
   To-morrow or to-day.
‘Into many a green valley
   Drifts the appalling snow;
Time breaks the threaded dances
   And the diver’s brilliant bow.
‘O plunge your hands in water,
   Plunge them in up to the wrist;
Stare, stare in the basin
   And wonder what you’ve missed.
‘The glacier knocks in the cupboard,
   The desert sighs in the bed,
And the crack in the tea-cup opens
   A lane to the land of the dead.
‘Where the beggars raffle the banknotes
   And the Giant is enchanting to Jack,
And the Lily-white Boy is a Roarer,
   And Jill goes down on her back.
‘O look, look in the mirror,
   O look in your distress:
Life remains a blessing
   Although you cannot bless.
‘O stand, stand at the window
   As the tears scald and start;
You shall love your crooked neighbour
   With your crooked heart.’
It was late, late in the evening,
   The lovers they were gone;
The clocks had ceased their chiming,
   And the deep river ran on.",'Love has no ending' is one of the most famous poems of the 20th century. The poem was written by British poet David Walliams. It was written in response to a poem by the same name written in the same year.
On the Circuit,"Among pelagian travelers,
Lost on their lewd conceited way
To Massachusetts, Michigan,
Miami or L.A.,

An airborne instrument I sit,
Predestined nightly to fulfill
Columbia-Giesen-Management's
Unfathomable will,

By whose election justified,
I bring my gospel of the Muse
To fundamentalists, to nuns,
to Gentiles and to Jews,

And daily, seven days a week,
Before a local sense has jelled,
From talking-site to talking-site
Am jet-or-prop-propelled.

Though warm my welcome everywhere,
I shift so frequently, so fast,
I cannot now say where I was 
The evening before last,

Unless some singular event
Should intervene to save the place,
A truly asinine remark,
A soul-bewitching face,

Or blessed encounter, full of joy,
Unscheduled on the Giesen Plan,
With, here, an addict of Tolkien,
There, a Charles Williams fan.

Since Merit but a dunghill is,
I mount the rostrum unafraid:
Indeed, 'twere damnable to ask
If I am overpaid.

Spirit is willing to repeat
Without a qualm the same old talk,
But Flesh is homesick for our snug
Apartment in New York.

A sulky fifty-six, he finds
A change of mealtime utter hell,
Grown far too crotchety to like
A luxury hotel.

The Bible is a goodly book
I always can peruse with zest,
But really cannot say the same
For Hilton's Be My Guest.

Nor bear with equanimity
The radio in students' cars,
Muzak at breakfast, or--dear God!--
Girl-organists in bars.

Then, worst of all, the anxious thought,
Each time my plane begins to sink
And the No Smoking sign comes on:
What will there be to drink?

Is this a milieu where I must
How grahamgreeneish!  How infra dig!
Snatch from the bottle in my bag 
An analeptic swig?

Another morning comes: I see,
Dwindling below me on the plane,
The roofs of one more audience
I shall not see again.

God bless the lot of them, although
I don't remember which was which:
God bless the U.S.A., so large,
So friendly, and so rich.","The author travels the U.S. with his gospel of the Muse. He delivers it daily, seven days a week, to all walks of life."
Even the Rain,"What will suffice for a true-love knot? Even the rain?
But he has bought grief’s lottery, bought even the rain.
“Our glosses / wanting in this world”—“Can you remember?”
Anyone!—“when we thought / the poets taught” even the rain?
After we died—That was it!—God left us in the dark.
And as we forgot the dark, we forgot even the rain.
Drought was over. Where was I? Drinks were on the house.
For mixers, my love, you’d poured—what?—even the rain.
Of this pear-shaped orange’s perfumed twist, I will say:
Extract Vermouth from the bergamot, even the rain.
How did the Enemy love you—with earth? air? and fire?
He held just one thing back till he got even: the rain.
This is God’s site for a new house of executions?
You swear by the Bible, Despot, even the rain?
After the bones—those flowers—this was found in the urn:
The lost river, ashes from the ghat, even the rain.
What was I to prophesy if not the end of the world?
A salt pillar for the lonely lot, even the rain.
How the air raged, desperate, streaming the earth with flames—
To help burn down my house, Fire sought even the rain.
He would raze the mountains, he would level the waves;
he would, to smooth his epic plot, even the rain.
New York belongs at daybreak to only me, just me—
To make this claim Memory’s brought even the rain.

Sing a song full of the faith that the dark past has taught us,
Sing a song full of the hope that the present has brought us;
Facing the rising sun of our new day begun,
Let us march on till victory is won.
Stony the road we trod,
Bitter the chast'ning rod,
Felt in the days when hope unborn had died;
Yet with a steady beat,
Have not our weary feet
Come to the place for which our fathers sighed?
We have come over a way that with tears has been watered.
We have come, treading our path through the blood of the slaughtered,
Out from the gloomy past,
Till now we stand at last
Where the white gleam of our bright star is cast.
God of our weary years,
God of our silent tears,
Thou who hast brought us thus far on the way;
Thou who hast by Thy might,
Led us into the light,
Keep us forever in the path, we pray.
Lest our feet stray from the places, our God, where we met Thee,
Lest our hearts, drunk with the wine of the world, we forget Thee;
Shadowed beneath Thy hand,
May we forever stand,
True to our God,
True to our native land.","Lyrics: ""Sing a song full of the faith that the dark past has taught us"" ""Let our rejoicing rise high as the list'ning skies, let it resound loud as the rolling sea"" ""We have come over a way that with tears has been watered"""
The Second Coming,"Turning and turning in the widening gyre
The falcon cannot hear the falconer;
Things fall apart; the centre cannot hold;
Mere anarchy is loosed upon the world,
The blood-dimmed tide is loosed, and everywhere
The ceremony of innocence is drowned;
The best lack all conviction, while the worst
Are full of passionate intensity.
Surely some revelation is at hand;
Surely the Second Coming is at hand.
The Second Coming! Hardly are those words out
When a vast image out of Spiritus Mundi
Troubles my sight: somewhere in sands of the desert
A shape with lion body and the head of a man,
A gaze blank and pitiless as the sun,
Is moving its slow thighs, while all about it
Reel shadows of the indignant desert birds.
The darkness drops again; but now I know
That twenty centuries of stony sleep
Were vexed to nightmare by a rocking cradle,
And what rough beast, its hour come round at last,
Slouches towards Bethlehem to be born?","The Second Coming is at hand, says the author, as a vast image emerges from the sands of the desert. The image is of a lion body and the head of a man, with a gaze blank and pitiless as the sun."
Stanzas,"Often rebuked, yet always back returning
    To those first feelings that were born with me,
And leaving busy chase of wealth and learning
    For idle dreams of things that cannot be:

To-day, I will seek not the shadowy region;
    Its unsustaining vastness waxes drear;
And visions rising, legion after legion,
    Bring the unreal world too strangely near.

I'll walk, but not in old heroic traces,
    And not in paths of high morality,
And not among the half-distinguished faces,
    The clouded forms of long-past history.

I'll walk where my own nature would be leading:
    It vexes me to choose another guide:
Where the gray flocks in ferny glens are feeding;
    Where the wild wind blows on the mountain side.

What have those lonely mountains worth revealing?
    More glory and more grief than I can tell:
The earth that wakes one human heart to feeling
    Can centre both the worlds of Heaven and Hell.","""I'll walk, but not in old heroic traces, not in paths of high morality, and not among the half-distinguished faces, long-past history,"" he writes. ""Where the gray flocks in ferny glens are feeding; where the wild wind blows on the mountain side"""
"Adonais, 49-52, [Go thou to Rome]","                  49

    Go thou to Rome,—at once the Paradise,
    The grave, the city, and the wilderness;
    And where its wrecks like shattered mountains rise,
    And flowering weeds, and fragrant copses dress
    The bones of Desolation's nakedness
    Pass, till the spirit of the spot shall lead
    Thy footsteps to a slope of green access
    Where, like an infant's smile, over the dead
A light of laughing flowers along the grass is spread;

                  50
      
    And gray walls moulder round, on which dull Time
    Feeds, like slow fire upon a hoary brand;
    And one keen pyramid with wedge sublime,
    Pavilioning the dust of him who planned
    This refuge for his memory, doth stand
    Like flame transformed to marble; and beneath,
    A field is spread, on which a newer band
    Have pitched in Heaven's smile their camp of death,
Welcoming him we lose with scarce extinguished breath.

                  51
      
    Here pause: these graves are all too young as yet
    To have outgrown the sorrow which consigned
    Its charge to each; and if the seal is set,
    Here, on one fountain of a mourning mind,
    Break it not thou! too surely shalt thou find
    Thine own well full, if thou returnest home,
    Of tears and gall. From the world's bitter wind
    Seek shelter in the shadow of the tomb.
What Adonais is, why fear we to become?

                  52
      
    The One remains, the many change and pass;
    Heaven's light forever shines, Earth's shadows fly;
    Life, like a dome of many-coloured glass,
    Stains the white radiance of Eternity,
    Until Death tramples it to fragments.—Die,
    If thou wouldst be with that which thou dost seek!
    Follow where all is fled!—Rome's azure sky,
    Flowers, ruins, statues, music, words, are weak
The glory they transfuse with fitting truth to speak.","Rome is the Paradise, the grave, the city, and the wilderness; and where its wrecks like shattered mountains rise. The bones of Desolation's nakedness pass, till the spirit of the spot shall lead thee to a slope of green access."
"September 1, 1939","I sit in one of the dives
On Fifty-second Street
Uncertain and afraid
As the clever hopes expire
Of a low dishonest decade:
Waves of anger and fear
Circulate over the bright
And darkened lands of the earth,
Obsessing our private lives;
The unmentionable odour of death
Offends the September night.
Accurate scholarship can
Unearth the whole offence
From Luther until now
That has driven a culture mad,
Find what occurred at Linz,
What huge imago made
A psychopathic god:
I and the public know
What all schoolchildren learn,
Those to whom evil is done
Do evil in return.
Exiled Thucydides knew
All that a speech can say
About Democracy,
And what dictators do,
The elderly rubbish they talk
To an apathetic grave;
Analysed all in his book,
The enlightenment driven away,
The habit-forming pain,
Mismanagement and grief:
We must suffer them all again.
Into this neutral air
Where blind skyscrapers use
Their full height to proclaim
The strength of Collective Man,
Each language pours its vain
Competitive excuse:
But who can live for long
In an euphoric dream;
Out of the mirror they stare,
Imperialism's face
And the international wrong.
Faces along the bar
Cling to their average day:
The lights must never go out,
The music must always play,
All the conventions conspire
To make this fort assume
The furniture of home;
Lest we should see where we are,
Lost in a haunted wood,
Children afraid of the night
Who have never been happy or good.
The windiest militant trash
Important Persons shout
Is not so crude as our wish:
What mad Nijinsky wrote
About Diaghilev
Is true of the normal heart;
For the error bred in the bone
Of each woman and each man
Craves what it cannot have,
Not universal love
But to be loved alone.
From the conservative dark
Into the ethical life
The dense commuters come,
Repeating their morning vow;
""I will be true to the wife,
I'll concentrate more on my work,""
And helpless governors wake
To resume their compulsory game:
Who can release them now,
Who can reach the deaf,
Who can speak for the dumb?
All I have is a voice
To undo the folded lie,
The romantic lie in the brain
Of the sensual man-in-the-street
And the lie of Authority
Whose buildings grope the sky:
There is no such thing as the State
And no one exists alone;
Hunger allows no choice
To the citizen or the police;
We must love one another or die.
Defenceless under the night
Our world in stupor lies;
Yet, dotted everywhere,
Ironic points of light
Flash out wherever the Just
Exchange their messages:
May I, composed like them
Of Eros and of dust,
Beleaguered by the same
Negation and despair,
Show an affirming flame.",I sit in one of the dives on Fifty-second Street. The unmentionable odour of death violates the September night. Accurate scholarship can uncover the whole offence that has driven a culture mad.
Landscape with the Fall of Icarus,"According to Brueghel

London,"I wander thro’ each charter’d street,
Near where the charter’d Thames does flow,
And mark in every face I meet
Marks of weakness, marks of woe.
In every cry of every man,
In every Infant’s cry of fear,
In every voice, in every ban,
The mind-forg’d manacles I hear.
How the Chimney-sweeper’s cry
Every blackning Church appalls;
And the hapless Soldier’s sigh
Runs in blood down Palace walls.
But most thro’ midnight streets I hear
How the youthful Harlot’s curse
Blasts the new-born Infant’s tear,
And blights with plagues the Marriage hearse.","""I wander thro’ each charter’d street, near where the charter'd Thames does flow, and mark in every face I meetMarks of weakness, marks of woe"" ""In every cry of every man, every Infant's cry of fear,                In every voice, in every ban,                The mind-forg'd manacles I hear"""

The helpless span narration cannot close.
Route nor spectacle will not go blind
Nor bind their broken conscience to a page: 
Learn to be No-one in the voice of none, 
Friend in that friendless element forever 
Unbegun, a sea, a body, a remorse—
Take up this leaf: what do the dead, 
The unborn defend? Your living syllable 
Too mute, too loyal to its desuetude 
To enter speech that does not speak 
Consent, and claim, and failure to conclude.",The poem was written in the first half of the 20th century. It is about the choice between suicide and redemption for the soul of the person who commits suicide.
The Palace of Forty Pillars,"Isfahan is half the world
I
Twenty pillars drip into the pool
their likenesses, where the likeness of a boy
wavers among the clouds, eyeing the boy
who’s waiting for another. All is dual:
two rows of roses frame the pool, in twos
the swans glide, each on another’s breast, then fuse
in a headless embrace. All is dissolved:
the boy outside the water is no more
a boy inside the water—his no more
the face defaced by its own lines on shattered
waves overlapping like a rose, the tattered
pillars strewn like petals. All is halved,
severed, like home and school, like love and being
loved—the boy no more than a way of seeing.","Twenty pillars drip into the pool where the likeness of a boy                wavers among the clouds.

Swan Song,"after the Persian of Mehdi Hamidi Shirazi
They say when the time comes for a swan to die,
it goes where other swans have gone to die.
They say as the last night begins to fall,
it trails behind the setting sun to die.
And it sings ghazals, as though it wished between
the pages of its own divan to die.
They say a swan loves only once and will
return to where its love was won to die.
Making its deathbed where it first made love,
it can forget it has withdrawn to die.
Are these tales true? In the desert, where I live,
no swan has come, not a single one, to die.
But then they say that swans return to water,
in whose embrace life was begun, to die.
Open your arms, my dear, and slake my thirst:
the time has come for one more swan to die.","The Persian of Mehdi Hamidi Shirazi is famous for his tales of swans. He says that when a swan dies, it returns to the place where it first made love."
The Yellow Swan,"I love the black swan.
—James Merrill, “The Black Swan”
At noon the pedaled swans afloat midstream
                 or parked at the water’s rim
find the boy first in line or there before
there is a line, and always the nice boatman
lets him mount his favorite ride, whose name 
                defies all rust and wear.
        He whispers, I love the yellow swan,
a secret he knows better than to share
                 save in the hollow ear-
like curve of that arched neck whose mirror image
breaks on rings of water as he climbs
between the wings and pedals from the pier, 
                a trail of molted plumage
         shuddering in his wake. The river foams,
churned by the paddle wheel and changed to ocean,
                 its surface cut by the question
mark of the swan—no, dragon!—gliding on
the hissing bloodstained waters as he turns
fire on darkness, almost wins his mission
                 while his parents chat in the sun,
         unaware of all that burns
down on the other bank. But like most love 
                the swan-ride is cut off.
The stroke of one o’clock returns the beast
to boat, the boat to boatman. He hates the boatman.
He hates his parents, whom he won’t forgive. 
                He hates the girl who’s next.
         Poor boy, he hates the yellow swan.","James Merrill’s “The Black Swan’ is about a boy and his love of swans. The boy rides the swan, a secret he knows better than to share with the world. He climbs between the wings and pedals from the pier, leaving a trail of molted plumage behind."
Coming Out of the Shower,"I shut my eyes under the scalding stream, 
                scrubbing off last night’s dream,
when suddenly I hear your voice again 
         as though it caught in the clogged drain
and was sent bubbling back up from the other 
                world where you’re not my mother.
This time, it’s really you. I’m really here. 
        I blink. We do not disappear.
Dad left, you say, to shower at the shop 
                so I don’t need to stop
just yet—and yet I do, unable to
         resume old customs, unlike you.
In a one-bath four-person household, we 
                learn what we mustn’t see,
growing, in time, so coolly intimate 
        with one another’s silhouette
behind the opaque frosted shower screen 
                that once more stands between
us two. While at the mirror you apply 
        foundation and concealer, I
wash out my hair with rosewater shampoo, 
                which means I’ll smell like you
all day. Mama, I shout, I’m coming out,
        and as you look away I knot
around me tight your lavender robe de chambre, 
                cinching my waist, and clamber
out of the tub, taking care not to step
         outside the cotton mat and drip
on the cracked floor you’ve polished with such zeal 
                we’re mirrored in each tile.
Yet, you’d forgive the spillage, or forget. 
        What else will you love me despite?","In a one-bath four-person household, we learn what we mustn’t see. We become so coolly intimate with one another’s silhouette. We’re mirrored in each tile."
Stare at the Sea,"Stare at the sea, the sea is blind.
The sea gives back your theme—
The sea that is not like, that cannot lack 
A thing
              —you have heard this sea intoned 
To every shock of chaos and of calm, 
As though soul’s torn two intellects 
Would marry in that hollow heave 
The harm they cannot fatalize, the thing 
A stonier dumb charm would weave 
Out of its own locked raging tides: 
The sea holds nothing it can hide.
Teach the sea to sing, the soul 
To drink its own imagining.
 ","The sea holds nothing it can hide. Stare at the sea, the sea is blind. The sea that is not like, that cannot lack."
Pilgrim Heights,"Something, something, the heart here 
Misses, something it knows it needs 
Unable to bless—the wind passes; 
A swifter shadow sweeps the reeds, 
The heart a colder contrast brushes.
So this fool, face-forward, belly 
Pressed among the rushes, plays out 
His pulse to the dune’s long slant 
Down from blue to bluer element, 
The bold encompassing drink of air
And namelessness, a length compound
Of want and oneness the shore’s mumbling 
Distantly tells—something a wing’s 
Dry pivot stresses, carved 
Through barrens of stillness and glare:
The naked close of light in light,
Light’s spare embrace of blade and tremor 
Stealing the generous eye’s plunder 
Like a breathing banished from the lung’s 
Fever, lost in parenthetic air.
Raiding these nude recesses, the hawk 
Resumes his yielding balance, his shadow 
Swims the field, the sands beyond, 
The narrow edges fed out to light, 
To the sea’s eternal licking monochrome.
The foolish hip, the elbow bruise
Upright from the dampening mat, 
The twisted grasses turn, unthatch, 
Light-headed blood renews its stammer—
Apart, below, the dazed eye catches
A darkened figure abruptly measured 
Where folding breakers lay their whites; 
The heart from its height starts downward, 
Swum in that perfect pleasure 
It knows it needs, unable to bless.",’s spare embrace of blade and tremor. ‘I can’t help it. I’m just here.’ “I’ve got to get out of here’. ’’‘I have to go home’
canción,"for Dzvinia Orlowsky
When I die, I want Papi’s boleros in air. Quémame con su canción.

"This Time, Not an Intruder","Kids’ Club After-School Program, The Gray House, March 2015
Fear made me block the side door with the chain.
A woman, glassy-eyed, rang the bell as if on fire.
Say “stranger” and the kids’ heads pop up like lemmings,
the memory of an intruder in our program last year,
that snarling voice that is mine yet not mine—a live
current under their skin. Rushed to the front door,
kids are matched to names to faces to signatures
and the side bell rings again. This time, I open
that door wide to confront a woman dark-lit by the sun,
words tangling like brambles in her mouth.
Photographing the homeless? None here.
I wave her down the ramp, trash bags
in one hand, rush to lock up the house,
feel my energy ebb. Second trash run.
She’s still there, turning the air
above the steering wheel. Then slumps.
Tell me how an angel feels. Not this panic.
I run in and dial. A cop raps on the car window
she forgets how to open. 25—the blood sugar
level she shouldn’t have, if she wants to live.
 ","A woman rang the bell as if on fire at The Gray House Kids’ Club After-School Program. The kids’ heads popped up like lemmings, with the memory of an intruder in our program last year."
This Too Shall Pass,"was no consolation to the woman
whose husband was strung out on opioids.

Some moments can’t be eased
and it’s no good offering clichés like stale
meat to a tiger with a taste for human suffering.
When I hear the word miracle I want to throw up
on a platter of deviled eggs. Everything happens
for a reason: more good tidings someone will try
to trepan your skull to insert. When fire
inhales your house, you don’t care what the haiku says
about seeing the rising moon. You want
an avalanche to bury you. You want to lie down
under a slab of snow, dumb as a jarred
sideshow embryo. What a circus.
The tents dismantled, the train moving on,
always moving, starting slow and gaining speed,
taking you where you never wanted to go.","It's no good offering clichés like stalemeat to a tiger with a taste for human suffering.

You’re the Top,"Last night I get all the way to Ocean Street Extension, squinting through the windshield, wipers smearing the rain, lights of the oncoming cars half-blinding me. The baby’s in her seat in the back singing the first three words of You’re the Top. Not softly and sweetly the way she did when she woke in her crib, but belting it out like Ethel Merman. I don’t drive much at night anymore. And then the rain and the bad wipers. But I tell myself it’s too soon to give it up. Though the dark seems darker than I ever remember. And as I make the turn and head uphill, I can’t find the lines on the road. I start to panic. No! Yes—the lights! I flick them on and the world resolves. My god, I could have killed her. And I’ll think about that more later. But right now new galaxies are being birthed in my chest. There are no gods, but not everyone is cursed every moment. There are minutes, hours, sometimes even whole days when the earth is spinning 1.6 million miles around the sun and nothing tragic happens to you. I do not have to enter the land of everlasting sorrow. Every mistake I’ve made, every terrible decision—how I married the wrong man, hurt my child, didn’t go to Florence when she was dying—I take it all because the baby is commanding, “Sing, Nana.” And I sing, You’re the top. You’re the Coliseum, and the baby comes in right on cue.","The author's daughter is singing You're the Top in the back seat of her car.

The Alpine Sheep,"When on my ear your loss was knelled,
    And tender sympathy upburst, 
A little spring from memory welled,
    Which once had quenched my bitter thirst.
And I was fain to bear to you
    A portion of its mild relief, 
That it might be as healing dew,
    To steal some fever from your grief.
After our child’s untroubled breath
    Up to the Father took its way, 
And on our home the shade of Death
    Like a long twilight haunting lay,
And friends came round, with us to weep
    Her little spirit’s swift remove, 
The story of the Alpine sheep
    Was told to us by one we love.
They, in the valley’s sheltering care, 
    Soon crop the meadow’s tender prime,
And when the sod grows brown and bare, 
    The shepherd strives to make them climb
To airy shelves of pasture green, 
    That hang along the mountain’s side,
Where grass and flowers together lean, 
    And down through mist the sunbeams slide.
But naught can tempt the timid things 
    The steep and rugged paths to try,
Though sweet the shepherd calls and sings, 
    And seared below the pastures lie,
Till in his arms their lambs he takes,
    Along the dizzy verge to go; 
Then, heedless of the rifts and breaks,
    They follow on, o’er rock and snow.
And in those pastures, lifted fair, 
    More dewy-soft than lowland mead,
The shepherd drops his tender care, 
    And sheep and lambs together feed.
This parable, by Nature breathed, 
    Blew on me as the south-wind free
O’er frozen brooks, that flow unsheathed 
    From icy thraldom to the sea.
A blissful vision, through the night, 
    Would all my happy senses sway,
Of the good Shepherd on the height, 
    Or climbing up the starry way,
Holding our little lamb asleep,— 
    While, like the murmur of the sea,
Sounded that voice along the deep,
    Saying, “Arise and follow me!”","The story of the Alpine sheep was told to us by one we love. When on my ear your loss was knelled, a little spring from memory welled. The shepherd drops his tender care, and sheep and lambs together feed."

Her hands press against her Sunday dress
her remaining son, her remaining daughter

    Not in mid June the golden-cuirassed bee
Feels a more summer-like warm ravishment 
       In the white lily’s breezy tent,
    His fragrant Sybaris, than I, when first 
    From the dark green thy yellow circles burst. 
    Then think I of deep shadows on the grass, 
Of meadows where in sun the cattle graze, 
          Where, as the breezes pass, 
The gleaming rushes lean a thousand ways, 
   Of leaves that slumber in a cloud mass, 
Or whiten in the wind, of waters blue 
      That from the distance sparkle through 
    Some woodland gap, and of a sky above, 
    Where one white cloud like a stray lamb doth move.
    My childhood’s earliest thoughts are linked with thee;
The sight of thee calls back the robin’s song,
          Who, from the dark old tree 
Beside the door, sang clearly all day long, 
     And I, secure in childish piety, 
Listened as if I heard an angel sing
        With news from heaven, which he could bring 
    Fresh every day to my untainted ears 
    When birds and flowers and I were happy peers. 
    How like a prodigal doth nature seem, 
When thou, for all thy gold, so common art! 
          Thou teachest me to deem
More sacredly of every human heart, 
    Since each reflects in joy its scanty gleam 
Of heaven, and could some wondrous secret show, 
       Did we but pay the love we owe, 
    And with a child’s undoubting wisdom look 
    On all these living pages of God’s book. ",The poem was written by the Italian poet Giorgio Agambini. It is set in the Italian tropics and Italy in the summer of 18th century.
Parable of the South Pole Buddha,"... the most tiny quantity of reality 
ever imagined by a human being

A physicist is stuck in a bunker at the South Pole, 
freezing his burrito off, and trying to detect the rare light
given off by one in six billion neutrinos streaking through 
the glacial ice, and it turns out he’s a guy I like 
talking poetry with sometimes and before he zooms 
to the white continent he tries to explain neutrinos to me 
like a priest describing the progress of the spirit to a child. 
  No, they’re not that three-piece punk band
from Philadelphia, making dancers oscillate in clubs
then fall into each other like so much dark matter.
Like most of us, they have a mean life and a half life.
Like most of us they decay too fast. But here’s the wonder:
these particles are so tiny, so unaffected, they shoot 
right through the planet and through us without so much 
as setting an electron quivering like a dragonfly’s wing. 
I wish I could do that, instead of lying in bed, 
feeling gravity glue me to the indentation in the mattress,
wish I could jet right through the world
like cosmic rain, a flight of neutrinos shaped like a poet 
and riding on the magic carpet of a weightless bed.
No tax forms, no lawyers, no dentists to drill 
through the crown to the rot and murder the root—
just stick my face in the pillow and jellyfish through.
I try to let go of my body, to drop without a parachute, 
a little Buddha, neither hot nor cold, but I can’t lift off 
like my friend who’s gone to glacial nowhere
and who sets up his machines while the unseen wind 
whishes by into the heart of cold, thinking 
he can measure the invisible, thinking he might actually 
understand what distinguishes us from nothing.","A physicist is stuck in a bunker at the South Pole, trying to detect the rare light given off by one in six billion neutrinos streaking through glacial ice.

Lobster,"At Shaw’s Market the lobster tank sits
to the right of the fish counter, just left 
of the freezer with the fish sticks and frozen 
perch. Therein lie the lobsters, stacked like 
so many traps, brackish and silent, their pincers 
rendered useless, wrapped shut tight in yellow 
plastic. Scuttled into these briny and light-dulled 
shallows, they hulk like the wrecks of some 
forgotten sea floor. One evening, uneasy, 
I went home to read what I could: phylum, 
arthropoda – cousins to trilobites, crabs, insects, 
spiders. I studied the neurobiology, learned 
lobsters have hundreds of eyes but do not see, 
not exactly, and I thought of one I judged 
somnolent flinching his taped pincers at my 
reflection looming like an eclipse, my domestic-
ated glimpse into the deep, what terror
he must have felt coupled with an absence 
of sediment that must have felt like, well, 
nothing. Six hundred million years, I thought 
of him there, sedated, stunned by the salt light. 
The next day I returned intending to purchase 
several and set them free; failing, I drove by 
myself to the beach where I stared at the sea. 
Lobsters once ruled all I could see, their armored 
carapaces inviolable, feeding on anything that 
might be. Lords of the Cambrian prehistory, 
they crawled out of time and into the late 
Quaternary, which is to say, us, left to rule 
the world as we must. What thief waits for 
me, I can’t help but think, as I leave the store
with my groceries, feel my way through the lot
looking for my lost sedan, crawling with unease
through the summer dark and soft salt-breeze?","Lobsters once ruled all I could see, their armored armored carapaces inviolable, feeding on anything that  might be. Lords of the Cambrian prehistory, they crawled out of time and into the late Quaternary, left to rule the world as we must."

Blackbird,"(Miles Davis, 1926–1991)
This is what heroin must feel like—
Miles Davis exacting
his way through “Autumn Leaves”—
pretty and cold, a slowly spreading frost
along synapses and veins,
mapping interstellar darkness
one blue note at a time. Sometimes you could hear
him thinking through the changes
like he was hunting himself, relentless
and without mercy, then a burst of blue
flame, squeezing the Harmon mute like a man screaming
from the bottom of a mine shaft—
but however brightly the darkness glows,
it is still darkness, and Miles was a blackbird
on a field of snow, beautiful, distant, quiet—
and however many steps you take to meet him he flies
ten more feet away.","""Autumn Leaves"" is one of Miles Davis' best-known works. The song is about a heroin addict mapping interstellar darkness one blue note at a time."
Epithalamium,"And it came to him that the question was loneliness-
when he grit his teeth, rearranging
his bones
                and self in an easy
chair, which would,
                                      as he thought, trigger
the worry he might dial her in the middle
of the night
                    only to hang up before she answers.
Then there were the variations: the loneliness
he wore with— no, like-
               a good sweater— while he sat in restaurants
reading magazines; while he explained
his life to people he met on airplanes; what made him
stand at the window thinking, without irony,
the private autumnal heart
is the last leaf to fall …
what resolved into a fugue
of silence, counterpoint
                                                 of all he would
never fully describe. As in the night he said
he loved her: billowing stars; black leaves;
berceuse wind. A sky
of stars, leaves, and wind. He remembered
thinking, with her in his arms,
of loneliness. What should he say? That they
would spend their evenings in metaphor,
in a house of silent song? That there
would be children?
Pray, love, that it be so simple.","Lonely is the last leaf to fall. Loneliness is the private autumnal heart of all he would never fully describe. He remembered thinking, with her in his arms, of loneliness. What should he say?"

One Cup of Chai,"If I had known that the cup of chai

in the kitchen, to make her

having blended water and milk 
in such strange ratios

the lowest tide) so to cover my blunder

and fled her room before she could 
collect her body, bring lip to saucer,

I presented, was after all, the only and 
last cup of tea I’d ever make her

granted the culinary wisdom to brew 
instead the pot with sprigs of lemongrass,
a pod of cardamom, perhaps even 
a prestigious thread of saffron
that I’d sneak from the silver hexagonal box 
she kept hidden behind the airtight jars 
of pricey nuts, and bring her
a creamy drink of complex caffeine, even
make some magnanimous promise 
of offering her tea on tap till she lived 
but knowing me, I know I’d have just 
continued being the spectacular failure I was 
that day, shit-talking my every inability 
out of her sight, embarrassed by failure, 
afraid of consequence and knowing her, 
she would have creased her nose 
at first, then continued to descend 
on the plate with the hopeful pull 
of her slurp, stubborn as she was, 
not willing to peg one finite judgement
of adulation or derision—

Abecedarian on the Good Father,"As he holds his wife’s hand, the nurse tells him to
breathe. He will be a good father. He 
could be. His wife tows a boat on land with her teeth. 
Don’t worry. Good father. Breathe. Later,
everyone smiles when he jogs with the stroller. He 
feigns interest in ponies. He pushes a swing and his daughter
giggles. He applies sunblock, and 
helps warm the bottle, and he is
inducted into the fatherly hall of fame. He 
jumps on the trampoline, and the chorus sings Good Father. He wipes
ketchup off her cheek at the zoo, and the old women 
laud. He is told he is a new breed of
man. Evolved. His knuckles just barely or
never scraping the ground. He hugs
often enough, packs her lunch, and the crowd 
pours on the applause. He lays her down for 
quiet time. It goes somewhat well. 
Rejoice, the people shout, for here is a
saint, as he lifts diapers to the conveyor belt.
Truthfully, he feels slightly
unwell. A bowl of plastic fruit is pretty, but 
vaguely toxic. He sleeps fine
without a mouth affixed to his chest. His bottle of
Xanax is half full. The nurse says,
You will be a good father. He jogs with the stroller. He reaches the
zenith of a very small hill. ","The author's wife tells him he will be a good father. He jogs with the stroller, pushes a swing and his daughter giggles. He hugs her often enough, packs her lunch, and the crowd applauds."
In Praise of Mystery: A Poem for Europa,"Arching under the night sky inky
with black expansiveness, we point
to the planets we know, we

pin quick wishes on stars. From earth,
we read the sky as if it is an unerring book
of the universe, expert and evident.

Still, there are mysteries below our sky:
the whale song, the songbird singing
its call in the bough of a wind-shaken tree.

We are creatures of constant awe,
curious at beauty, at leaf and blossom,
at grief and pleasure, sun and shadow.

And it is not darkness that unites us,
not the cold distance of space, but
the offering of water, each drop of rain,

each rivulet, each pulse, each vein.
O second moon, we, too, are made
of water, of vast and beckoning seas.

We, too, are made of wonders, of great
and ordinary loves, of small invisible worlds,
of a need to call out through the dark.","From earth, we read the sky as if it is an unerring bookof the universe, expert and evident. But there are mysteries below our sky: whale song, the songbird singing in the bough of a wind-shaken tree."
Postcolonial,"for Louis Chude-Sokei
I went to graduate school because I was lonely
only to find myself
more lonely—lost scaling the canyons and breaches
of who I was and what I loved: books
women, ideology:
stuck in the brambles of politics and melanin.
Walking the stacks and quadrangles, at war
with my subject
positions, unable to locate my position
on any map;
I have become my invention. I have my theories.
The self is a theory, a way of walking, a history
and a geography, four and five dimensions, several
kinds of time: uncharted
terrain, and, look, there I am, lost on the shores
of my longing—
walking the campus of my limits, lost
and contemplating
the war I fought with sentiment, the war I lost
with solitude.","The self is a theory, a way of walking, a history and a geography, four and five dimensions, several kinds of time. Louis Chude-Sokei: I went to graduate school because I was lonely."
From “An Epistle”,"From Joshua Ibn Vives of Allorqui to his former master, Solomon Levi-Paul, de Santa-Maria, Bishop of Cartagena, Chancellor of Castile, and privy councillor to King Henry III of Spain.
                                       I.
Master and Sage, greetings and health to thee, 
    From thy most meek disciple! Deign once more 
Endure me at thy feet, enlighten me, 
    As when upon my boyish head of yore, 
Midst the rapt circle gathered round thy knee 
    Thy sacred vials of learning thou didst pour.
By the lage lustre of thy wisdom orbed 
Be my black doubts illumined and absorbed. 
                                       II.
Oft I recall that golden time when thou, 
    Born for no second station, heldst with us 
The Rabbi’s chair, who are priest and bishop now;
    And we, the youth of Israel, curious, 
Hung on thy counsels, lifted reverent brow 
    Unto thy sanctity, would fain discuss 
With thee our Talmud problems good and evil, 
Till startled by the risen stars o’er Seville. 
                                       III.
For on the Synagogue’s high-pillard porch
    Thou didst hold session, till the sudden sun 
Beyond day’s purple limit dropped his torch. 
    Then we, as dreamers, woke, to find outrun 
Time’s rapid sands. The flame that may not scorch,
    Our hearts caught from thine eyes, thou Shining One. 
I scent not yet sweet lemon-groves in flower, 
But I re-breathe the peace of that deep hour. 
                                       IV.
We kissed the sacred borders of thy gown, 
    Brow-aureoled with thy blessing, we went forth
Through the hushed byways of the twilight town. 
    Then in all life but one thing seemed of worth, 
To seek, find, love the Truth. She set her crown 
    Upon thy head, our Master, at thy birth;
She bade thy lips drop honey, fired thine eyes 
With the unclouded glow of sun-steeped skies. 
                                       V. 
Forgive me, if I dwell on that which, viewed 
    From thy new vantage-ground, must seem a mist 
Of error, by auroral youth endued 
    With alien lustre. Still in me subsist 
Those reeking vapors; faith and gratitude 
    Still lead me to the hand my boy-lips kissed 
For benison and guidance. Not in wrath,
Master, but in wise patience, point my path. 
                                       VI.
For I, thy servant, gather in one sheaf
    The venomed shafts of slander, which thy word 
Shall shrivel to small dust. If haply grief, 
    Or momentary pain, I deal, my Lord
Blame not thy servant’s zeal, nor be thou deaf 
    Unto my soul’s blind cry for light. Accord—
Pitying my love, if too superb to care 
For hate-soiled name—an answer to my prayer.","From Joshua Ibn Vives of Allorqui to his former master, Solomon Levi-Paul, Bishop of Cartagena, Chancellor of Castile, and privy councillor to King Henry III of Spain."
Blessing the Baby,"When my upstairs neighbor invites me to her baby shower,

again. I am a bad neighbor, but she’s going to be a mother 
                so she’ll have to practice forgiveness on someone first. Usually, 
I’m a people pleaser. I am a people. I was born 
                with all the people I could ever create, inside me. I try 
to forgive them—their dirty handprints on my skirt, the towels
                left on the bathroom floor. We blessed the baby 
while we tied around our wrists one long, red string. 
                For a moment, the string connected us—wives, mothers, 
and me, neither—until it didn’t, until the scissors severed 
                us, made a bracelet of the blood string. I told the baby, 
I give you this wrist. The world will break all your blessings
                if it wants, and believe me, baby, most of the time, it wants.","I was born with all the people I could ever create, inside me.

Sonnet,"I would not tarry if I could be gone 
    Adown the path where calls my eager mind. 
    That fate which knows naught but to grip and bind 
Holds me within its grasp, a helpless pawn, 
And checks my steps when I would travel on. 
    Forever shall my body lag behind, 
    And in this valley with the moaning wind 
Must I abide with never a glimpse of dawn? 
Though bends my body towards the yawning sod, 
    I can endure the pain, the sorrows rife, 
That hold me fast beneath their chastening rod, 
    If from this turmoil and this endless strife, 
Comes there a light to lead man nearer God, 
    And guide his footsteps toward the Larger Life.","""I would not tarry if I could be gone  forever,"" says the author. ""I can endure the pain, the sorrows rife,  that hold me fast beneath their chastening rod,"" he adds."

"Walking Beside the Cemetery, Olivia Street, Key West","The City Cemetery was established in 1847

                                   —“Historic Key West City Cemetery,” City of Key West Florida

In Key West, the living surround the dead, 
who are the best neighbors 
silent and agreeable as well-swept porches. 
A fence that separates this world 
from the next keeps their restless spirits 
in or ours out. Do these dead know they are 
dead, lying in their own dead ghetto, their little 
houses stacked, neat bleachers, or lined up like 
rows of beach towels? 
Each morning the living rise like drowned 
voyagers from their beds, dreams, sleep slough 
falling from their eyes. They greet mortality 
a footfall from their door. What is it like to live 
among the dead? What is it like to rest among 
the living? Do the dead dream too? 
Do they turn their dead faces beyond the fence, 
like moths to fever and regret?
Once, the sea rose like an emancipator 
and pulled the dead from their parched 
slumber. Bones as needy as dry fruit rose 
like giddy children upon the sea’s fickle back. 
What joy that must have been, to ride 
the sea free of stone abode, to leap 
and turn like froth, like ash dancing 
among a living flame. In the end 
the dead were dead again, slumped in trees 
and elsewhere like drowned creatures, and the 
living were left alive again to bury and to mourn.","Key West City Cemetery was established in 1847 on “high ground, sixteen feet above sea level” in Key West, Florida. The then beachside cemetery was unearthed due to the winds and seas."

You could write about the windows
all nine of them. You could write about

shore, the opaque eyes of dead fish
caught in the algal bloom. You could write 
about the sky—long as a yawn, sky blue
chasing cerulean away, stretched wisps
of white determined to be the canvas 
for another sunset showstopper. But the body
has its own narrative in mind. Neurons hustling 
pain blank out any page. No writing can be done

searching for song while one temple pulses 
an arrhythmic lament. Mercifully there’s triptan,

Woman with Mop and Bucket,"She’s smocked in blue, like peasants by Millet
at work, a crook or pail in hand, or bent,
perhaps, for sewing, nursing, sheaving hay,
their faces worn by pity and consent.
The airport crowds have atomized by now;
the loos are nearly empty. There, alone,
she traces arcs, a model showing how
it’s done—left, right, ahead—as if to hone
her gestures as a dance routine. She sings,
a thread that rises, falls, and floats.
The words are muffled. Might her voice give wings
to home thoughts, in its melancholy notes?
I speak to her in English; no reply,
no recognition. I use Spanish then;
she’s pensive, unaware. So should I try
my Creole French? But no; to speak again
would seem interrogation. Does she see
me, even, leaning as she swirls her mop?
She is the body of the melody,
its mute existence when the song must stop.","The airport crowds have atomized by now; the loos are nearly empty. There, alone, she traces arcs, a model showing how it’s done. She sings, a thread that rises, falls, and floats."

shape. A hawk on steady currents circles, dips, and dives;
at play, a boy picks up a pinecone, turns it in his hand,
and casts it lightly, carrying his thought, among the trees.
The underlayer of the painting shaped, compressed,
the man then drips the crystal granules in geometries
of mind’s design, for mind’s enchantment and the eye’s,
yet born in nature: mountains, rivers, mesas, birds,
the sun and stars, changed into lines and circles, triangles,
the z’s of storm—commending by world’s matter
God’s primordial words. The artist pauses, straightens
edges, steps away, seeing his handiwork in its gratuity—
an offering to others, to the day’s divinities: what could be
more sacramental than to borrow the earth, reshape
and order it, returning it to earth as a diurnal sacrifice?
The work, perfected, moves toward its undoing as the sun
above the distant mesa waits immobile, swelling like
a woman’s body and inflamed, then plunges down,
leaving a ruddy afterbirth. In shadow now, the picture
is erased by him who made it, who himself is dust—bound
to heaven’s motions, honoring God’s time by dying in it.","The artist draws on the ground until idea takes shape. The grains propose the spectrum of the landscape (golden, glassy, iron red, black of basalt)"
"René Char Leaves France, 1944","—Southern France
The captive springtime moves on espadrilles
among mimosas flaming into bloom,
their coral lamps illumined through the hills,
investing the Vaucluse with their perfume.

With others, René Char awaits the news
from England, knowing that the final fight
is coming. Orders meanwhile. To refuse
all compromise has been his word. Tonight

he’s flying out for Africa, above
the olive groves and lemon-scented earth
to which his acts are rooted, as in love
inscribing him, beyond the fact of birth,
by poetry and sacrifice for France.
He leaves in secrecy: no fanfares yet;
but down the darkened slopes of the Durance,
where stealthily the shadows cast their net,

his men have lighted fires in farewell,
whose constellations shine along his route
as brilliant sea-marks in the mistral’s swell—
each star fraternal and a last salute.",René Char is a French poet and author. He is best known for his work in Africa. He died in a plane crash in Africa in 2011.
Mas El Solanot,"When you invited me to Mas El Solanot,
with its hydrangeas, hibiscus, vines,
you did not say that in the afternoon,
as light collected, pensive, in a haze
beyond the apple trees and fields of hay,
my eyes could go from fold to fold, along
the blue conceptions of the Pyrenees
until they turn to clouds, nor how the cliffs
of Castelfollit de la Roca hold
the houses on their shoulders, balancing
ideas of artefact and world—and how
the arches of the bridge at Besalú
dissolve against the evening sun, then form
again from shadows on the other side,
in Romanesque relief. And later, when
we had commended the paella, praised
your Catalan rosé, the darkness brought
the music of Albéniz, gathering
the high chromatic landscapes into sound;
And on an old Chilean disk we heard
Neruda in inimitable voice
declaim the soul of Machu Picchu, name
its stones, its hunger and its misery—
the glorious, enduring suffering
of man. I leaned over the window, felt
a stillness in the wind, the stirring rock,
as if the earth acknowledged our design.
You wove me in, a figure in your scene,
a word among your words. The evidence
is places in the mind—the painted mas
surprising me, the harmonies of line,
the mountains soughing in their leafy dream.","When you invited me to Mas El Solanot, with its hydrangeas, hibiscus, you did not say that in the afternoon, light collected, pensive, in a haze of haze.

The Bookseller,"Until I die, I shall abide by books—
feeling the leather and the gilded spine,
running my thumb along the rippled edge,
sensing the musty cloth, the wormy page,
the odor of a chest or rooms untended
where some distant heir one day divined
a windfall for his bank account, and called
on me. Here, watch your step; I cannot
see, but my companion says that books
have almost filled the hallway, overflowed
the bedroom, where I feel their presence
in the night among my dreams,—Will you have
a cup of tea and scones, or else a hot cross
bun, to mark the season? Yes, all London
bustles here near Oxford Street, and I suppose
I need the sense that others are about;
but what we know most keenly is desire,
and in desire I know the darkness, not
the life I hear but that which I Imagine—
the way you, reading of the Trojan War
or the Crusades, perhaps, are startled
by the telephone, thinking of Helen’s face
instead, of Hector’s body pulled behind
the wheels of arrogance. Tamer of horses
I can never be—but rider of another world
informed by paper—and, for me, in tongues
beneath my fingertips. To sell, of course,
is necessary, and I thank you; but I need
to feel behind me, too, this field of words
aflame, where blinded poets make the Sirens
sing, and I can almost glimpse the light,
the dazzling seascape that Odysseus sailed.","Until I die, I shall abide by books—feeling the leather and the gilded spine. In desire I know the darkness, not the life I hear but that which I Imagine."
Dissidence,"in memoriam Thelonious Monk
You have to be able to hear past the pain, the obvious
minor-thirds and major-sevenths, the merely beautiful
ninths; you have to grow deaf to what you imagine
are the sounds of loneliness; you have to learn indifference
to static, and welcome noise like rain, acclimate
to another kind of silence; you have to be able to sleep
in the city, taxis and trucks careening through your dreams
and back again, hearing the whines and sirens and shrieks
as music; you must be a mathematician, a magician
of algebra, overtone and acoustics, mapping the splintered
intervals of time, tempo, harmony, stalking or sluicing blues
scales; you have to be unafraid of redundance, and aware
that dissonance-driven explorations of dissonance
may circle back to the crowded room of resolution;
you have to disagree with everything except the piano, black
and white keys marking the path you must climb step
by half-step with no compass but the blues, no company
but your distrust of the journey, of all that you hear, of arrival.","In memoriam Thelonious Monk, Thelonius Monk writes about the pain and loneliness of life. Monk's music is a mixture of algebra, overtone and acoustics, mapping the splintered splinters of time, tempo, harmony and stalking blues scales."

up strands and estuaries—
the midrange stands
for the imagination

of comfort

tasks of the everyday

a maker might glance
at loved ones

Gwendolyn Brooks,"Sometimes I see in my mind’s eye a four or five
year old boy, coatless and wandering
a windblown and vacant lot or street in Chicago
on the windblown South Side. He disappears
but stays with me, staring and pronouncing
me guilty of an indifference more callous
than neglect, condescension as self-pity.
Then I see him again, at ten or fifteen, on the corner,
say, 47th and Martin Luther King, or in a group
of men surrounding a burning barrel off Lawndale,
everything surrounding vacant or for sale.
Sometimes I trace him on the train to Joliet

Santa Tarantula,"Now we praise her, her soft scopulae
for scaling glass, her silk spinnerets, always
reaching. There is shifting the egg sac often,
which a male arachnologist named brooding.
There is losing babies and calling this
our lives. There is singingsingingsinging, staring
into another mother’s face and saying it is still
the sun. Also, bittersweet sea smoke. Also,
burnt sugar hissing on the stove. There is scaphism:
death by milk and honey in a shallow dish.
There is shame surfacing like foam.
There is the most powerful species named johnnycashi,
and his hooks there to restrain our fangs during sex.
“If one crawls into my bed and I name it, will it be
nicer to me?” asks one man, as some of us cling
to trees, some to the soil sacristy. Praise
the tarantula woman still alive at forty. Praise her shifting
smalt of sky, her quiet stare, her morning face shriving
the sheets. This is how you kill a tarantula.
Cover her, and hope to God she suffocates.","There is shame surfacing like foam. There is scaphism: death by milk and honey in a shallow dish. Praise her shifting smalt of sky, her quiet stare, her morning face."
I Consider Violence,"When the starvation-hair appears
all over my body, you call it fascinating,

I never decide what to wish for first,
food or you. Or rather, eating food again
or never again eating you. Your favorite part
of me, my cupped hipbone, empty
as a half mango scooped clean of its flesh.
Your least favorite part, my hunger.
I learn to fill myself with other things:
the julienned light in the bedroom, mouthfuls
of Debussy from the old piano, the endless suck
of the toilet, which, bravely, never stops running.
Even vowels become impossible luxuries,
so round they seem indulgent against my tongue.
I consider violence after hearing that on death row
you get one last perfect meal. I imagine the photo
in the newspaper story, where I look so
beautiful.
I think of the woman in the Bible
who asks for John’s head on a platter.
Maybe she was only hungry.
Maybe she wanted to be satisfied.","When the starvation-hair appears                all over my body, you call it fascinating,                which is not the same as beautiful.

Would you brush a little onto my face?
I arch against your palm
until you cannot look away.

might do anything

The Black Man’s Bit,"O there’s talk from school to pulpit, and the barber’s place is rife,
And the shoe shop and the supper table hum,
With the tale of Dixie’s black men who have shared the mighty strife
For that freedom of the better time to come.
Every mother’s eye is brighter, every father’s back is straighter,
And our girls are tripping lightly in their pride,
And by none except a Teuton, or a slacker, or a traitor, 
Will the right to their elation be denied.
They said they were too slow, too dull, too this and that to do it,
They couldn’t match the method of the Hun,
And then to arm a million—why, the land would surely rue it
If a million blacks were taught to use a gun.
But right won out, and they went in at all detractors smiling;
They learned as quick as any how to shoot,
They took the prize at loading ships, and riveting and piling,
And trained a thousand officers to boot.
And when they went ’twas with a boon no others had been bringing,
For whether with a pick or with a gun,
They lightened every labor with a wondrous sort of singing,
And turned the pall of battle into fun.
O the Frenchman was a marvel, and the Yankee was a wonder,
And the British line was like a granite wall,
But for singing as they leaped away to draw the Kaiser’s thunder,
The swarthy sons of Dixie beat them all.
And now that they have helped to break the rattling Hunnish sabre,
They’ll trail the Suwanee River back again
To Dixie home, and native song, and school and honest labor,
To be as men among their fellow men.
No special thanks or praise they'll ask, no clapping on the shoulder
They did their bit, and won, and all men know it
And Dixie will be proud of them, and grown a little older,
And wiser, too, will welcome them and show it.",Dixie's black men helped break the Hunnish sabre. They trained a thousand officers to boot. They lightened every labor with a wondrous sort of singing. They turned the pall of battle into fun.

Slush beneath your boots

It around, a handsome crook

We have no wings. No power beyond our century 
We are given less, and still we sing.

Whose every breath is kindliness, whose hearts are purest gold.","One drop of midnight in the dawn of life’s pulsating streamMarks her an alien from her kind, a shade amid its gleam. For refuge, succor, peace, and rest, she seeks that humble fold."
Douglas,"      Is Douglas dead? 
That grand old man, that pleasant face,
      That mirrored idol of the Negro Race!
Has he been struck from foremost rank, 
       Into earth’s dusty apron sank
And no one to take his place? 
               God forbid!
Yea forbid that the winds should mourn,
      Or on zephyr’s timely wings be borne
That word: For death in silent tread,
      Would loath to disgrace that honored head
By writing ’bove it “He is dead:”
                 For he lives. 
And every hour that wings away,
    Prolongs his life another day.
For sure the flower from its stalk, 
     May drop and wither upon the walk, 
Yet lives to bloom again that stalk: 
               So Douglas lives.
He tho’ a plant of the tropics, grew
     In America to live and do;
And did he it, and did it well,
      True until his gray hairs fell.
Of a greater man, no records tell,
      And still he lives. 
Tho’ kind old mother earth, perhap, 
   Doth rock him gently in her lap, 
His slumber is sweetest rest:
   Gray hairs float on his mother’s breast: 
Yet speak not of him, but as the best, 
    For still he lives. 
And up this barrier wall of life, 
    His deed amid the storm and strife, 
Doth, clutching, climb on like the vine, 
    Around each rock some tendrils twine, 
Till blossom they in warm sunshine
                    To never die. 
No, never, tho’ that aged head
    Be lulled to sleep—but one was made, 
And making him, was made a cleft
     In earth, and not a remnant left, 
From which another might be made. 
     So sleep on thou aged blest, 
Thy work is done, so take thy rest. 
     For bear, O winds, to murmur aught
But praise for mighty deeds he wrought! 
     Rock gently in thy orb, O earth,
Frey not him of humble birth, 
     But let him rest. 
Stoop down, O heaven, kiss his brow, 
    For oft before thee did he bow; 
Let holy angels watch his grave, 
    And ne’er let man forget the brave,
The good, the noble, humble slave 
   Who rose to highest fame.",Douglas Adams was an African-American man who rose to fame in the United States. He was a hero of the civil rights movement. Adams was killed in a car crash in 1963.
Her Last Farewell,"O welcome death! I’m glad you’ve come
       ’Twill serve my purpose true:
Just cut eternity’s veil in twain
        And let my soul pass through, 
And away from Earth’s dismal scene
        And the merry making crowd, 
The giddy whirl of the banquet hall,
        To home beyond the cloud—
Ah! then, dear mother, weep no more, 
       But strive to meet me there: 
The space is small twixt life and death, 
      Fill it well with prayer—
So now, O, death, let fall thy sword, 
      ’Tis but a kiss of love
Much welcomed by the eager soul, 
    Waiting to flit above. 
Farewell to earth! Farewell to friends. 
     To maiden young and gay, 
Think well on how you spend your life, 
    For death will come one day. ","Death is but a kiss of love bestowed by the eager soul, waiting to flit above. O welcome death! I’m glad you’ve come. Farewell to friends."
Sonnet,"God is and is seen wherever we look, 
From the roaring sea to the noiseless brook;
From the everlasting snow-clad hill,
To the smallest sand beneath the rill.
The granite rock and the liquid flood,
Each portray the living hand of God!
From the blazing sun that rules the day,
To the faint light of the glow worm’s ray;
From the blue vaults of the azure sky,
From all the nocturnal worlds on high;
To the smallest insects on the ground,
Wherever that insect may be found,
The daguerreotype of God is there,
Insects, stars and sky and sun declare. ","""God is and is seen wherever we look,"" says the poet. ""The daguerreotype of God is there, wherever you look,"" he adds."
I’ll Follow Thee,"My Savior, let me hear Thy voice tonight, 
    I’ll follow Thee, I’ll follow Thee; 
The clouds that overhang my way, obscure
  the light, 
    And all is dark to me. 
I’d hear Thy voice above the tempest’s shriek; 
    I’ll follow Thee, I’ll follow Thee; 
And though my sight be dim, my spirit weak, 
    I’ll trust, though naught I see. 
I’d feel Thy arm, supporting in the dark; 
    I’ll follow Thee, I’ll follow Thee; 
For Thou canst fan to flame, faith’s sinking 
  spark, 
    And seal my loyalty.
I shall not sink, dear Lord, when Thou’rt my 
    guide, 
       I’ll follow Thee; I’ll follow Thee; 
Though lashed by heavy waves, on ev’ry side, 
       I’m safe, when Thou’rt with me.","My Savior, let me hear Thy voice tonight,  let me follow Thee. I’ll trust, though naught I see, and all is dark to me. “I’m safe, when Thou’rt with me.”"
Oh List to My Song!,"Oh list to my song, my sweet, dark eyed 
 dove! 
   Oh list to thy lover today! 
For I’ve come from afar, to woo thee
 again, 
   Though, erstwhile, you sent me away. 
But I heard thy sighs in my troubled 
 dreams. 
   And methought they were sighs of pain; 
So I’ve come, I’ve come on the wings of 
 of my love, 
   To offer my true heart again. 
Oh say that my heart has not hoped in 
 vain! 
   Oh tell me the sweet dream was true! 
And lift those dark lashes, oh sweet love 
 of mine,
   And hide not thine eyes from my view.
Oh love, those dear eyes are telling the 
 tale, 
   That thy lips refuse to repeat! 
Come thou, to my heart; thou art mine, 
 thou art mine, 
   Till time and eternity meet!","""I’ve come from afar, to woo thee again,  though, erstwhile, you sent me away. Oh list to my song, my sweet, dark eyed dove!"" ""I heard thy sighs in my troubled dreams,"" says the poet."
"Not Dead, but Sleeping","We say he is dead; ah, the word is too 
   somber; 
’Tis the touch of God, on the weary 
   eyes,
That has caused them to close, in peace-
   ful slumber, 
   To open with joy, in the upper skies. 
We say he is gone; we have lost him for- 
   ever; 
His face and his form we will cherish no 
   more; 
While happy and safe, just over the river, 
   He is waiting for us, where partings 
   are o’er. 
Ah, sad are our hearts, as we gaze on
   him sleeping,
And bitter and sad are the tears gush-
   ing down; 
And yet,— but we cannot see, for the 
   weeping,—
   He has only exchanged the cross, for 
   the crown.
And though the dark mists of grief may 
   surround us, 
   Obscuring the face of the Father above, 
And blindly we grope, still His arms are 
   around us, 
   To guide and sustain with His pitying 
   love. 
And he whom we love, is safe in His 
   keeping, 
   Yes, safe and secure, whatever may 
   come; 
But ne’er will we know how sweetly he’s 
   sleeping. 
   Till God, in His mercy, shall gather us 
   home.","We say he is dead; ah, the word is too somber;                 ’Tis the touch of God, on the weary                     eyes, that has caused them to close, in peace-filled slumber. But ne’er will we know how sweetly he’s sleeping."
Going to the Picnic," 1 
 There is a large crowd of young folks 
 Hurrying down the road; 
 They are going to have a picnic now, 
 And spread the news abroad. 
 2 
 They are wearing beautiful bouquets, 
 And carrying bright tin dippers; 
 New straw hats are waiving high, 
 And patent leather slippers. 
3 
 Their hats are made of fine chiffon, 
 And decorated too. 
 There will be plenty of goodies 
 For your friends and for you. 
4
 They will have a big barbecue. 
 And a lot of other stuff. 
 They are going to eat and drink 
 Till everybody puff. 
5
 They will have cakes and candy by the heaps, 
 And ice cream pressed in cake; 
 Peanuts parched fresh and hot, 
 And a lot of fine milk shakes. 
 6 
 They will have fish croquets by the bushels, 
 And cocoanut jumbles too; 
 They are going to feed their friends and foes 
 And have enough for you. 
 7 
 They are going to have a big dance 
 And have a jolly time. 
 They want to show their handsome looks 
 Because they look so fine.  
 8 
 One barrel or two of lemonade, 
 Mixed all through with ice; 
 Lemons cut and thrown therein 
 Gee! it’s awful nice. 
9 
 Of all the fun and jolities, 
 And all the places of rest, 
 Just go to an old picnic ground; 
 They tell me that’s the best. ","A large crowd of young folks are going to have a picnic. They are wearing beautiful bouquets and carrying bright tin dippers. They will have cakes and candy by the heaps, and ice cream pressed in cake."

Saturday Class: Janie Crawford is Grown,"In class today,
We mused on Janie and Tea Cake
And how love saves and wounds.
And I said,
Who is Janie’s true love?
And they said,
Tea Cake.
And I said
Are you sure?
And Eboni said,
She love herself like she ’posed to.
She wanted to be like the bee and the flower
But her granny wouldn’t let her.
And we all nodded.
Logan treated her like a mule
And Joe like a doll baby
And Tea Cake was her

She come back home.

Is this the end of the story?

And she ain’t studyin’ nothin’.","In class today, we mused on Janie and Tea Cake. Janie wanted to be like the bee and the flower, but her granny wouldn’t let her. Eboni said she love herself like she ’posed to."
Abolition of Slavery in District of Columbia,"Thank God! from our old ensign
      Is erased one mark of shame,
Which leaves one less to rapine,
      One less to blight our fame.

      And wails of the enslaved;
But in the blest hereafter

Apostrophe of Time,"O fleeting Time! whence art thou come?
      And whither do thy footsteps tend?
Deep in the past where was thy home,
      And where thy future journey's end?
Thou art from vast eternity,
      And unto boundless regions found;
But what and where’s infinity?
      And what know we of space unbound?
The furrowed brow betokens age;
      But who thy centuries can tell?
Was ancient seer or learned sage
      In wisdom’s lore e’er versed so well?
Hast thou from childhood wandered thus,
      Companionless and lone, through space,
With mystery o’er thy exodus,
      And darkness 'round thy resting place.
What lengthened years have come and gone,
      Since thou thy tireless march began,
Since Luna’s children sang at dawn,
      The wonders of creation’s plan?
How many years of gloom and night
      Had passed, long ere yon king of day
Had reigned his fiery steeds of light,
      And sped them on their shining way?
Thou knowest—Thou alone, O thou!
      Omniscient and eternal Three!
To whose broad eye all time is now—
      The past, with all eternity;
In whose dread presence I shall stand,
      When time shall sink to rise no more,

Sweet Singer,"Reign did silence o’er the stage
       As night passed on
And destiny fraught with laurels sat,
       Sweet laurels never won,
Till was read aloud her name
       And forth the sweet voiced singer came.
While grim old night worn out with age,
       Listening to the vibrating stage,
Wept because he must pass on.
       But hark! they do applaud her so:
She bows, she smiles and then looks round,
       She opens her lips and lo!
Bursts forth a trembling sea of sound:
       A sea voluptuous in its swell.
The waves rose high and then they fell;
       While beat the etherial shores, the tide,
And ebbing then the waves subside
       To music’s gentler flow.
O’er the vast and blue expanse
       Leaped the merry music on:
Around the universe, the flow
       Of that angelic tone;
Till heaven’s shores, the tidelets lashed
       And wavelets o’er the portals dashed.
The billowy waves break forth the sounds
       Reach the great white throne and rebound
Echoing the song of home.",The song was written in the early 1980s. It is about a woman whose name was read aloud at her funeral. The song is called ‘The Song of Home’.
The Blind Musician,"The vesper bells rang out the day
       The jostling crowd moved on its way:
The sexton flared the old church light;
       The lamps were lit and all was bright.
Then slowly thro’ the open door,
       The moving crowd began to pour;
And smiling youth and hoary age,
       Alike were crowding round the stage.
A blind musician, flushed and gay,
       Mounted the stage and picked his way
To where an old piano lone
       Awaited to adjust its tone.
His form swayed as moved by the breeze,
       Electric fingers swept o’er the keys,
And like the mighty tides of the sea
       That slowly swell and flood the lea,
He made the strains of music rise
       And swell till they had lashed the skies.
The crowd sat mute, their minds had flown
       On trembling notes to shores unknown,
Belated teamsters left their dray
       And toward the chapel sought their way;
A star peeped thro’ the clouds o’er head
       And seemed to trip and onward sped.
The blind musician lower bent,
       And swift the rolling music went
Like the gentle ebb and the flow
       Of ocean tides that come and go,
Or like the roll of drum and fife,
       Or sounds of conflict and of strife,
E’en more, the mocking bird would trill
       Its warbling lays and all was still
Till soft the sound of winds swept o’er,
       And broke a mighty tempest roar.
Lightening seemed in the player’s hand;
       A music cyclone struck the land.
Then came a creak as if were struck
       Some massive house, or trees were plucked
From their roots, and the thunder’s might
       Made those near by leap up in fright
Then came the lull, the storm was gone:
       The musician seemed sad and lone.
Thought he must of his darling wife,
       Whom he’d ne’er seen in all his life,
But as he sat in sad repose,
       Much he looked like the last fair rose.
Tho’ music vibrated ev’ry vein,
       A rose bloomed out on Sharon’s plain.
O, what genius in deed and thought!
       What mechanism by heaven wrought!
A soul of light, tho’ earth and skies
       Gave not light to his blinded eyes,
His fingers sought the keys once more,
       And played he then as ne’er before
And tossed he like a ship on the main,
       Till his soul echoed the last sad strain.","A blind musician, flushed and gay, Mounted the stage and picked his way to where an old piano lone stood. His form swayed as moved by the breeze, the keys swept o’er the keys, and like the mighty tides of the sea he made the strains of music rise."
Astronomy,"Oh science sequestered much,
And by wisdom’s gentler touch,
         Accelerated more!
Did not they voice give the command
That man must venture from his strand
In quest of other distant land,
         Or was it ancient lore?
For sure into his peaceful breast,
Thou breathed the spirit of unrest,
         And bade him search the skies:
Thou pictured earth a moving sphere
Whose revolutions make the year,
And whispered to his listening ear,
          “Search heaven and be wise.”
Thy presence round him, charming fell.
And break did it the magic spell
         That ignorance had wrought:
And plain did seem the merry race
Of myriad planets thrown in space—
Just how each kept in his place,
         Has fostered wondrous thought.
And oft the would-be infidel
Has list the story that you tell
         And wisely gave a nod;
For now the planet checkered sky
And tangle comments hissing by
Have seized and borne his thoughts on high,
         Acknowledging a God.
No day has dawned, no sunbeam shone,
Where thought of man has not yet gone:
         And the rugged panoply,
Encasing of his mental frame,

And I’ve longed for the face that never returned.

How gladly I’d spend my whole life at thy side,
    How honored I’d feel to be there;
Oh, I’ve learned to revere the heart that I spurned!
    And I long for the face that never returned.
If thou shouldst return, ah, vain is the dream!

Memorial Day,"Go;—for ’tis Memorial morning—

"To a Certain Lady, in Her Garden","Lady, my lady, come from out the garden,
Clayfingered, dirtysmocked, and in my time
I too shall learn the quietness of Arden,
Knowledge so long a stranger to my rhyme.
What were more fitting than your springtime task?
Here, close engirdled by your vines and flowers
Surely there is no other grace to ask,
No better cloister from the bickering hours.
A step beyond, the dingy streets begin
With all their farce, and silly tragedy—
But here, unmindful of the futile din
You grow your flowers, far wiser certainly,
You and your garden sum the same to me,
A sense of strange and momentary pleasure,
And beauty snatched—oh, fragmentarily
Perhaps, yet who can boast of other seizure?
Oh, you have somehow robbed, I know not how
The secret of the loveliness of these
Whom you have served so long. Oh, shameless, now
You flaunt the winnings of your thieveries.
Thus, I exclaim against you, profiteer. . . .
For purpled evenings spent in pleasing toil,
Should you have gained so easily the dear
Capricious largesse of the miser soil?
Colorful living in a world grown dull,
Quiet sufficiency in weakling days,
Delicate happiness, more beautiful
For lighting up belittered, grimy ways—
Surely I think I shall remember this,
You in your old, rough dress, bedaubed with clay,
Your smudgy face parading happiness,
Life’s puzzle solved. Perhaps, in turn, you may.
One time, while clipping bushes, tending vines,
(Making your brave, sly mock at dastard days,)
Laugh gently at these trivial, truthful lines—
And that will be sufficient for my praise.",The poem was written in the early 19th century. It was written by a woman who lived in the village of Arden. The poem is called ‘The Lady in the Garden’.
Nodes of Growth,"for Molly Peacock
My mother thinks she cannot grow 
orchids: the initial blooms shrivel,  
turn to dust on the window ledge.  
The stalk, once green, becomes 
a dry stick, soon appraised  
for the same value she gives  
every crinkled brown leaf: 
She cut it off. 
She did not know to wait 
to examine turgid base leaves,  
jungle vibrant, roots brimming  
the pot’s rim, testing the drainage holes,  
seeking sun, trickling water. 
It must work harder now 
to bloom once the stem  
has been removed. 
At middle age, I appreciate 
the orchid’s beauty: its shy blooms 
burst from a dead stick: 
nodes of growth emerge  
as tender youth did once. 
I got my first orchid at fifty. I was 
unable to accept the end of my body’s  
usefulness. The aura of attraction 
shriveled, I secretly  
cheered for the orchid  
whose tender nodes explode 
unexpected, fighting 
against our assumption that  
beauty only bursts from  
the sweet young green.  ","Molly Peacock grew her first orchid when she was 50 years old. The orchid's shy blooms burst from a dead stick, she says."
Alzheimer’s,"He sits, silent,

of the present beauty out the window,

or the twilit battles in Korea, or me

eschatology,"i’m confident that the absolute dregs of possibility for this society,
the sugary coffee mound at the bottom of this cup,
our last best hope that when our little bit of assigned plasma implodes 
it won’t go down as a green mark in the cosmic ledger,
lies in the moment when you say hello to a bus driver 
and they say it back—
when someone holds the door open for you 
and you do a little jog to meet them where they are—
walking my dog, i used to see this older man 
and whenever I said good morning, 
he replied ‘GREAT morning’—
in fact, all the creative ways our people greet each other
may be the icing on this flaming trash cake hurtling through the ether. 
when the clerk says how are you 
and i say ‘i’m blessed and highly favored’ 
i mean my toes have met sand, and wiggled in it, a lot. 
i mean i have laughed until i choked and a friend slapped my back.
i mean my niece wrote me a note: ‘you are so smart + intellajet’
i mean when we do go careening into the sun, 
i’ll miss crossing guards ushering the grown folks too, like ducklings 
and the lifeguards at the community pool and
men who yelled out the window that they’d fix the dent in my car, 
right now! it’d just take a second—
and actually everyone who tried to keep me alive, keep me afloat, 
and if not unblemished, suitably repaired.

“Integrated School Books” Arpeggio,"The Crisis Magazine, June 1967
On the cover, Negro men playing checkers
in the park. Some wear hats, while others wear
waves in their hair. Either way, they’re all clean
and their strategy brims as sharp as their 
suits. Within these pages, they’re playing chess,
protecting future children, as they wear
ties, dress shirts, shined shoes—looking clean
and ready for business or for battle. And their
plan? No longer will textbooks be used as chess
pieces to keep Negro children in check.
Sound familiar? Schools will be pushed to clean
bookshelves of the white-washed lessons of their
past. The NAACP opens minds like games of chess,
and all excuses for hiding a country’s checkered
past will be dismissed. Despite segregation’s wear
and tear from school boards, and the fear of their
white parents, henchmen, bullies—all just chess
pieces, really, but jumping laws like checkers
when life is more complex—books remain where
the mind cannot hide. Either you come clean
and admit your ignorance, or be a pawn on the chess
board of intellect, banning books. They think check-
mate! But when I see Crisis in a library archive where
we still argue to be seen, I lose patience. Kleenex,
please, for Karens clutching their pearls! I pray their
white kids are reading Langston Hughes in a public library: √.
But one state over, bookshelves have no Black authors, cleaned
out. Our books remain under attack, Kings in a game of chess.","Crisis Magazine, June 1967. No longer will textbooks be used as chess pieces to keep Negro children in check. Schools will be pushed to cleanbookshelves of the white-washed lessons of their past."
Stars in Alabama,"In Alabama
Stars hang down so low,
So low, they purge the soul
With their infinity.
Beneath their holy glance
Essential good
Rises to mingle with them
In that skiey sea.
At noon
Within the sandy cotton-field
Beyond the clay, red road
Bordered with green,
A Negro lad and lass
Cling hand in hand,
And passion, hot-eyed, hot-lipped,
Lurks unseen.
But in the evening
When the skies lean down,
He’s but a wistful boy,
A saintly maiden she,
For Alabama stars
Hang down so low,
So low, they purge the soul
With their infinity.","For Alabama stars hang down so low, so low they purge the soul with their infinity. In Alabama a Negro lad and lass hold hands hand in hand, passion, hot-eyed and hot-lipped, lurks unseen."
Poet of Our Race,"Dedicated to the memory of Paul Laurence Dunbar
Oh, Poet of our Race,
We reverence thy name
As thy hist’ry we retrace,
Which enfolds thy widespread fame.
We loved thee, yea, too well,
But He dids’t love thee more
And called thee up with Him to dwell
On that Celestial shore.
Thy sorrows here on earth,
Yea, more than thou coulds’t bear,
Burdened thee from birth
E’en in their visions fair.
And thou, adored of men,
Whose bed might been of flowers,
With mighty stroke of pen
Expressed thy sad, sad hours.
Thou hast been called above,
Where all is peace and rest,
To dwell in boundless love,
Eternally and blest.
And, yet, thou still dost linger near,
For thy words, as sweetest flowers,
Do grow in beauty ’round us here
To cheer us in saddest hours.
Thy thoughts in rapture seem to soar
So far, yea, far above,
And shower a heavy downpour
Of sparkling, glittering love.
Thou, with stroke of mighty pen,
Hast told of joy and mirth,
And read the hearts and souls of men
As cradled from their birth.
The language of the flowers,
Thou hast read them all,
And e’en the little brook
Responded to thy call.
All Nature hast communed
And lingered, yea, with thee,
Their secrets were entombed
But thou hast made them free.
Oh, Poet of our Race,
Thou dost soar above;
No paths wilt thou retrace
But those of peace and love.
Thy pilgrimage is done,
Thy toils on earth are o’er,
Thy victor’s crown is won,
Thou’lt rest forever more.",Paul Laurence Dunbar was an English poet. He is best known for his poem 'The Poet of our Race' The poem is dedicated to Dunbar's memory.

[Song into holiness],"Song into holiness,
the sister has written her book—
nothing there of falsehood,
nothing invented by the poet.
Pain rides itself through the book,
though the one from Carthage
knows a blessèd life in God.
Should the author now look
carefully in a dark glass,
and the book close on a moment of joy?","Pain rides itself through the book, though the one from Carthage knows a blessèd life in God. Song into holiness, the sister has written her book."
"My face is an iteration, but the song in my belly is ancestral","The Slave Castle in Elmina isn’t as beautiful as her name suggests
I enter the clay arms of Gorée Island’s ancient grounds
and let this be the last thought that steals my attention
The red fortress still leans against the volcanic rocks
as stunning as any glossy travel magazine cover
it’s hard to distinguish eloquent architecture from its destructive design
Listen, beauty can kill more beautiful things
It delights in possessing the bruised, sweet fruit, whether it bursts or rots
The stubborn door of Maison des Esclaves fastens shut after we enter
and I can’t help but look at the vicious maw
suspicious as a stolen bride
The spirituals in my chest 
are eager to return to a home I know
“The Door Of No Return” waits patiently ahead 
Have you ever stared at a hungrier death?
The dank, stony cell closest to the sea once cradled children and women
I imagine they were the color of my great-grandmother 
with cheekbones and noses as sharp as cutting knives
The murder pen is flanked by stone-structured quarters 
where island-bound women once thrived as keepers of the captured
where island-bound women were taught to slice her sister’s flight 
a math problem divided by no living answer
I can still see the blue-black neck of the gun barrel 
Hot hot and cutting through the castle’s meticulous slit
signaling the shark’s breakfast with screams from the bullet’s prey
as the current crash awaits blood gold from the enslaved
What other hell is there to believe in?
In the belly of the mausoleum, where the echoes lift the hair on my forearms
I hold my chest like a machete and weep for the lives stolen until shadows
I like to think I am a patient coup-ready woman 
But I know the heaven we jump towards is merely a holy crawl
You got to harrow deep within to free the deadly hope from your gut 
After months and months and months of steel rust blisters
Sometimes, the only peace you can count on lives 
in the jaws of a sea beast or a stolen country’s mineral pit
Hollow, be the manmade purgatory you believe in
I swear, on everything I love
hell looks nothing like this
    The Sound in my Body1 (Murmuration & Echo) 
  It delights in possessing the bruised sweet fruit no matter if it bursts or rots
and I can’t help but look at the vicious maw
The spirituals in my chest 
“The Door of No Return” waits patiently ahead 
The dank stony cell closest to the sea once cradled children and women
with cheekbones and noses as sharp as cutting knives
where island-bound women once thrived as keepers of the captured

  1. The murmur is an acknowledgment of [Cathay] Williams’s being the only Black woman in the Buffalo Soldier’s 38th Infantry. The final construction consists of three parts. The first element, “The Sound,” is a thirty-eight-line poem written by the poet. The subsequent construction, “The Murmuration,” is a poem that takes the even numbers from the previous composition. These lines, nineteen in total, will then be divided into six tercets. “The Murmuration” closes with a declarative statement from line 37 of “The Sound.” The final piece, “The Echo,” is composed by taking the first line from each tercet in “The Murmuration.” The collection of these three elements will complete the full murmur.","The Sound in my Body consists of three parts. “The Sound,” is a thirty-eight-line poem written by the poet.

First South,"The First South Carolina Volunteer Infantry Regiment, organized in August 1862
Of course, they were first—under that palmetto flag
whose palm fronds crossed into the stars
and bars, how could they not throw down
the hooked hoes, the baskets they shook to fan 
the rice? Who remembers
which man said yes first, remembers which twig
catches first when the forest lights?
Prince Rivers. Robert Sutton.
Caesar Johnson. Poll McKee. 
William Bronson. Bristow Eddy. 
Henry McIntyre. Robert Freeman.  
London Bailey. Cato Wright.
A partial roster. Defying naysayers at the north, 
daily reducing slavery’s prophecies
to history, no nibbling away at guns
in the Battle of the Hundred Pines
but infantry picking off Rebel cavalry, 
threshing blood from blood thirty miles above the mouth 
of the St. Marys River. Florida, late January. 
Their first skirmish. Smell of horses, smell of resin.
A minor battle, according to those who believe war
measured best by biggest massacre—
as if being first killed is the chief reason 
in being first. A partial memory: 
their colonel, deep in his notebooks, 
recording their grit—first shots, first dead—
for his report, rushing words across the pages
before he loses the sounds, the images
(the pines the men the moon the guns the blood),
before the mind forgets, as a sentinel forgets last week’s
countersign. Then paperwork for supplies. A partial
inventory—canteen, gun-sling, haversack, 
cartridge-box, cap-pouch, shoe-strings, 
bayonet—their discarded things, 
their molasses-and-water, their hardtack.
What they kept—regimental, personal.
Called a regiment marching into the future, 
needing no Proclamation to resist, they were 
piloting gunboats, requisitioning lumber;
first to push past anyone who said wait, 
they were loading their muskets with a will that means fight, 
they were marching into a country first to forget.","The First South Carolina Volunteer Infantry Regiment, organized in August 1862, fought in the Battle of the Hundred Pines. Their first skirmish was a minor battle, according to those who believe war is measured best by biggest massacre."
Projector,"Light takes new attribute
and yet his old
glory
enchants;
not this,
not this, they say,
lord as he was of the hieratic dance,
of poetry
and majesty
and pomp,
master of shrines and gateways
and of doors,
of markets
and the cross-road
and the street;
not this,
they say;
but we say otherwise
and greet
light
in new attribute,
insidious fire;
light reasserts
his power
reclaims the lost;
in a new blaze of splendour
calls the host
to reassemble
and to readjust
all severings
and differings of thought,
all strife and strident bickering
and rest;
O fair and blest,
he strides forth young and pitiful and strong, 
a king of blazing splendour and of gold,
and all the evil
and the tyrannous wrong
that beauty suffered
finds its champion,
light
who is god
and song.
He left the place they built him
and the halls,
he strode so simply forth,
they knew him not;
no man deceived him,
no,
nor ever will,
with meagre counterfeit
of ancient rite,
he knows all hearts
and all imagining
of plot
and counterplot
and mimicry,
this measuring of beauty with a rod, 
no formula
could hold him
and no threat
recall him
who is god.
Yet he returns,
O unrecorded grace, 
over
and under
and through us 
and about;
the stage is set now
for his mighty rays;
light,
light that batters gloom,
the Pythian
lifts up a fair head
in a lowly place,
he shows his splendour
in a little room;
he says to us,
be glad
and laugh,
be gay;
I have returned
though in an evil day
you crouched despairingly
who had no shrine;
we had no temple and no temple fire 
for all these said
and mouthed
and said again;
beauty is an endighter
and is power
of city
and of soldiery
and might,
beauty is city
and the state
and dour duty,
beauty is this and this and this dull thing, 
forgetting who was king.
Yet still he moves
alert,
invidious,
this serpent creeping
and this shaft of light,
his arrows slay
and still his footsteps
dart
gold
in the market-place;
vision returns
and with new vision
fresh
hope
to the impotent;
tired feet that never knew a hill-slope 
tread
fabulous mountain sides;
worn
dusty feet
sink in soft drift of pine
needles
and anodyne
of balm and fir and myrtle-trees
and cones
drift across weary brows
and the sea-foam
marks the sea-path
where no sea ever comes;
islands arise where never islands were,
crowned with the sacred palm
or odorous cedar;
waves sparkle and delight
the weary eyes
that never saw the sun fall in the sea 
nor the bright Pleaiads rise.","The Pythian was a king of blazing splendour and of gold. He left the place they built him and the halls, strode so simply forth, they knew him not. No man deceived him, nor will he ever be deceived."

   Because it doth endure
Vicissitude, and season, as the grasse;
Methinks I lied all winter, when I swore,
My love was infinite, if spring make’it more.
But if this medicine, love, which cures all sorrow
With more, not onely bee no quintessence,
But mixt of all stuffes, paining soule, or sense,
And of the Sunne his working vigour borrow,
Love’s not so pure, and abstract, as they use
To say, which have no Mistresse but their Muse,
But as all else, being elemented too,
Love sometimes would contemplate, sometimes do
And yet no greater, but more eminent,
   Love by the spring is grown;
   As, in the firmament,
Starres by the Sunne are not inlarg’d, but showne,
Gentle love deeds, as blossomes on a bough,
From love’s awakened root do bud out now.
If, as in water stir’d more circles bee
Produc’d by one, love such additions take,
Those like so many spheares, but one heaven make,
For, they are all concentrique unto thee,
And though each spring doe adde to love new heate,
As princes do in times of action get
New taxes, and remit them not in peace,
No winter shall abate the spring’s encrease.","I scarce believe my love to be so pure as I had thought it was. Because it doth endure Vicissitude, and season, as the grasse. I lied all winter, when I swore my love was infinite."
Club Paradise,"Early days of July, heatwave membraned 
the city, Aura and Zephyr lockjawed 
and left the girl looking a mouldered grey.
Only the wind of expiation blows,
or at least attempts to smooth our rafters. 
Still, ardour conspires with every breath
and makes my voice a giant scallop shell,
scoffed with apologies and songs. Hear me
out: I am as faithful as a coral reef. 
A behemoth backfires in Eden
and sets off total colony collapse.
Hell seems happier. Well, hell, go to hell
then! Easy: hell is in the air outside. 
I will stay, resuscitate our hive 
with what I know of work: transparent words
next to transparent words, ransomed for love,
the sake of love, fresh, renewed, startled back
into place by a breathless, heavy blow
from my hautboy. Gold tremble off my lips. 
We are way out beyond limits now. Too 
far for tears, except the sun brings them on.
It is me. Taken by paranoid seizure,
weeping at the dark deluxe of the sun
like an actor or a Rasta, chanting:  
Paradise once, paradise once again!
But this is rose-pink Florence, infernal 
as ever, interred by the living light
we have half blocked out with half drawn shutters
to make the ecliptic line visible,
so even here we may be “unalarmed
by the vicissitudes of the future.”
Now that’s viva luce. Casual rapture. 
Surety and fidelity are terms,
on pain of death, not to be avoided.  
Pop a paxlovid, beloved, read this
as I tell you that I am the Seraph 
Abdiel, indignant before the devil. 
Do you feel weak in body or mind? 
In spirit? Well, that was unexpected. 
My angelic recommendations are 
cold baths and the movies of Gene Tierney. 
Abdiel I said? Let me now abdicate 
from that tower, for my mind is constant 
changes, as now single in retorted 
scorn for current major minor poets. 
One must have a talent to unmask shades. 
It is your savage gift, and mine, to conceal 
openly berries from childhood forest, 
our heads shawled like witches in the green,
mosquitoes pitched partisans’ melodies,
a half tropical bluff in my left ear.
Solomon’s Mine flourished in my right ear. 
You are as impatient as I am not. 
Everything moves is firm philosophy. 
But moves how? In a flagellum pattern?
I can’t imagine that. Yet I can see
furtive fern, under shadowed, move as such;
as such, when I was a schoolboy, iron 
filings straggled on my desk, ant or rain
drawn, I supposed, by a phantom magnet. 
I know now that it was the Holy Ghost. 
You’ve called me a Christian fabulist 
before, and I’ve played the clown, it’s true, 
but only for your serious amusement,
nightly pointing out the fading dog star. 
I aim each morning to salute the sun. 
What I call progress is antiquity 
in reverse, the wheels off, transfigured light
through the dark sky, flared; immolated; gone. 
In Club Paradise, my father alone
of all the extras had a speaking part. 
A single phrase, a question, when he asked 
got lost in his dreads. Heuristic technique
you could say. Don’t laugh, he’s an amputee
now, still delusional but on good pension.
Flesh of my flesh, love. I cannot go far, 
and I have gone far, and not hear my blood shriek 
with the thought that all of this could be cut  
by a second-string executioner.
My heart rides at anchor telling you this.

1.
in the days before urban sprawl this town
remained no more than cow pastures
logs skidding down to the harbor
gulls riding them like surfboards
a green belt embraced the one road north
a hundred years they say until the lease expired
in those days trees lining each side threw shade over
hippies and geese bound to the same direction
this was the rainforest and we took
for granted the trees that sheltered the sun
in shimmering light the music of wind
and leaves that left air breathable 
we thought the developers would never come
that Eden would last forever

if I remember well the first to go
was the old growth Ponderosa near the school
     what a racket all that sawing and sawing
     no sapling that one stubborn tough
     from thick outer ring to the core
on overhead wires larks crows and common wrens 
lined up like jurors surveying a crime scene
chortling and cackling a chorus of what’s
      this what’s this come see come see
     every so often one broke rank
     and swooped toward the cantilevered trunk
as if they could bring back to life those limbs
where each night they had fought to gain purchase 
     circling as if remembering the canopy

one morning on the sun-drenched asphalt
a blue feather lay as if fallen by magic
from some child’s dream of angels
was there ever a bird so blue so
cobalt perfect from downy barbs to vanes
to fall undamaged by progress 
among the squalor of high-rises and noise 
of backhoes awakening each morning 
was this an omen an augury a straw in the wind
to land here where few trees thrive
you look up at the birdless sky think:
this is a city   this a mountain
this a remnant of the rainforest","Lena Herzog, Last Whispers is an oratorio for vanishing voices, collapsing universes, and a falling tree. Herzog: ""The ghosts of forests reside in every city"" ""I listen for the rustle of leaves"""
To a Snowflake,"What heart could have thought you?—
Past our devisal
(O filigree petal!)
Fashioned so purely,
Fragilely, surely,
From what Paradisal
Imagineless metal,
Too costly for cost?
Who hammered you, wrought you,
From argentine vapour?—
“God was my shaper.
Passing surmisal,
He hammered, He wrought me,
From curled silver vapour,
To lust of His mind;—
Thou could’st not have thought me!
So purely, so palely,
Tinily, surely,
Mightily, frailly,
Insculped and embossed,
With His hammer of wind,
And His graver of frost.”","“God was my shaper, He hammered, He wrought me, from curled silver vapour, to lust of His mind” “Thou could’st not have thought me!”"
Dead Boy,"translated from the Japanese by Jeffrey Angles
I am a boy, having never known love, 
Who has suddenly fallen from the summit  
Of frightening infancy into the darkness of a well 
Dark, watery hands choke my delicate neck 
Innumerable needles of cold push into me, 
Killing my heart, wet as a fish 
Inside, each organ swells like a flower 
As I move horizontally below the earth 
Along the surface of the water  
Eventually, from the green horn in my groin 
A sprout, unreliable and delicate, will grow 
Clawing up the heavy soil with thin hands 
One day, like a pallid face, 
Its tree will rustle under the painful light 
For I desire as much space inside me  
For light as space for shadow
    死んだ少年
  ぼくは　愛も知らず
怖ろしい幼年時代の頂きから　突然
井戸の暗みに落ちこんだ少年だ
くらい水の手が　ぼくのひよわなのどをしめ
つめたさの無数の雛が　押し入って来ては
ぼくの　魚のように濡れた心臓をあやめる
ぼくは　すべての内臓で　花のようにふくれ
地下水の表面を　水平にうごいていく

たよりない芽が生え　重苦しい土を
かぼそい手で　這いのぼっていくだろう 
青ざめた顔のような一本の樹が
痛い光の下にそよぐ日が来るだろう

And You . . .,"a walk in a midwinter ochre wood
to get some england sun
as it steals away—
a little poodle runs to show you love;
you like the feel of the animal’s body
on your leg; it’s something
of an acceptance so you smile
and are not the least bothered; you even hope
it’ll jump, though the lady yells
no jumping Sam! no jumping!
and when she adds ‘you know he
just loves EVERYbody!’ why should you
suddenly feel tears coming?—
it’s just that EVERYbody; how do you
explain this? there’s nobody to explain
it to: why she needed to take away
from you this one feeling of special?
how could she know it was the most
human moment of your day—
the most human moment in weeks?",A little poodle runs to show you love. You smile and are not the least bothered; you even hope it’ll jump. But when she adds ‘you know he just loves EVERYbody!’ why should you feel tears coming?
Phragmites,"I’ve crashed a party with an infinity pool and several nude men:
a Fire Island home at the back of a walkway long enough to
outlast a pop song’s bridge and some chorus, flanked by
phragmites on either side, tall and same-faced, so all
but reed bulk hides out from the exterior. Myself
included, close to everyone here has a body of
one approximate build. What would it say if I
stay? Comfort’s not so comfy here, but I stay
and try to have a good time: periodic beach
guest, mainly through favors from men
whose wealth eclipses mine and most
of humankind. I know firsthand why
queers come to this place, obliterate
coherence, take, go, take, till
we’ve consumed enough
to leave.
Someone riding the stiffest
substance cocktail he can muster
GROANS he’s got to pee and can’t,
his functions stalled in the twist and now.
What he can still swing is a smile. Excess
soaks the sundecks and each redwood inch
of the mini villa with a sweet-hot stickiness.
There’s much more to take in, with nowhere to go.","Fire Island home at the back of a walkway long enough to                outlast a pop song’s bridge and some chorus, flanked byphragmites on either side, tall and same-faced, so all                but reed bulk hides out from the exterior.

I
Music’s poltergeist among the grand spirits,
can you now tell what such possession is
                    or was
saying: I know the woman who stands here
in Pushkin’s clock-haunted house,
shadowy figure nimbus’d by light’s mode
amid the wan company thinning at dawn.
The air sways, a lamp holds vigil
with its smoky flame.
The fiddle is in velvet, the cello
has ceased to urge her proud commodious song.
II
The cello’s long since ceased to urge her proud
commodious song. It is like a love story 
that ends up tragic; or some common débâcle
heroic by decree.
There’s breach of custom that privileges laughter.
In art we hazard so much void of compulsion. 
The silence and down-turned thumb are not
compulsion but luck, or the climate, being in the wrong place.
The sublime wearies, so we have farting on brass
like one of Stalin’s jokes. This is a sketched-in
historical thesis. You will call it parody.
III
You will call this parody yet your own music
is like a spectral dance more than a dance of spirits
                    when it is not
like a wide city under a bronze sky,
when it is not the Neva or a high voicing
of a passion-nocturne by Aleksandr Blok;
the unheard-of threnos brought into hearing
and, once heard, a presentiment from nature
          no more to be wondered at
but in the broad way of wonder and acceptance.
Not parody precisely. It is true I think
IV
that I have now confused you with Zhivago
and Pushkin and my own ambition
to write Onegin and fifteen string quartets
and some sparely glittering poem about Christmas
                    or Easter;
to get the drum-raps right for cracking the spring ice:
more fitful as a human testament
than heart-murmur or tinnitus, or the way one’s jaw
creaks when eating. Finally I declare homage
to the late Frank O’Hara, intelligent, choosy
lover of Russia and of Russian music.
V
Who is this woman who stands here in Pushkin’s 
clock-haunted house? I do not know.
                    I cannot
tell presence from memory amid the wan
company thinning at dawn. She is a muse
of sorts, that much is certain. Her hand
is nimbus’d in a gesture of rebuke
or blessing, and the lamp holds vigil
          with its well-trimmed flame.
The house-door stands ajar. The cello has now long
languished from her immemorable aubade. ","Music’s poltergeist among the grand spirits, can you now tell what such possession is?

The Quids,"The little quids, the million quids,
The everywhere, everything, always quids,
The atoms of the Monoton,
Each turned three essences where it stood,
And ground a gisty dust from its neighbors’ edges,
Until a powdery thoughtfall stormed in and out,
The cerebration of a slippery quid enterprise.
Each quid stirred.
The united quids
Waved through a sinuous decision.
The quids, that had never done anything before
But be, be, be, be, be,
The quids resolved to predicate
And dissipate in a little grammar.
Oh, the Monoton didn’t care,
For whatever they did—
The Monoton’s contributing quids—
The Monoton would always remain the same.
A quid here and there gyrated in place-position,
While many essential quids turned inside-out
For the fun of it
And a few refused to be anything but
Simple, unpredicated copulatives.
Little by little, this commotion of quids,
By threes, by tens, by casual millions,
Squirming within the state of things,
The metaphysical acrobats,
The naked, immaterial quids
Turned inside on themselves
And came out dressed,
Each similar quid of the inward same,
Each similar quid dressed in a different way—
The quid’s idea of a holiday.
The quids could never tell what was happening.
But the Monoton felt itself differently the same
In its different parts.
The silly quids upon their rambling exercise
Never knew, could never tell
What their pleasure was about,
What their carnival was like,
Being in, being in, being always in
Where they never could get out
Of the everywhere, everything, always in,
To derive themselves from the Monoton.
But I know, with a quid inside of me,
But I know what a quid’s disguise is like,
Being one myself,
The gymnastic device
That a quid puts on for exercise.
And so should the trees,
And so should the worms,
And so should you,
And all the other predicates,
And all the other accessories
Of the quid’s masquerade.","The everywhere, everything, always quids, the atoms of the Monoton. The quids resolved to predicate                And dissipate in a little grammar. The silly quids upon their rambling exercise never knew."
The Habit of Perfection,"Elected Silence, sing to me
And beat upon my whorlèd ear,
Pipe me to pastures still and be
The music that I care to hear.
Shape nothing, lips; be lovely-dumb:
It is the shut, the curfew sent
From there where all surrenders come
Which only make you eloquent.
Be shellèd, eyes, with double dark
And find the uncreated light:
This ruck and reel which you remark
Coils, keeps, and teases simple sight.
Palate, the hutch of tasty lust,
Desire not to be rinsed with wine:
The can must be so sweet, the crust
So fresh that come in fasts divine!
Nostrils, our careless breath that spend
Upon the stir and keep of pride,
What relish shall the censers send
Along the sanctuary side!
O feel-of-primrose hands, O feet
That want the yield of plushy sward,
But you shall walk the golden street
And you unhouse and house the Lord.
And, Poverty, be thou the bride
And now the marriage feast begun,
And lily-coloured clothes provide
Your spouse not laboured-at nor spun.","Poverty, be thou the bride                And now the marriage feast begun.                The can must be so sweet, the crust so fresh that come in fasts divine!                Nostrils, our careless breath that spend their time upon the stir and keep of pride.                O feel-of-primrose hands, O feet that want the yield of plushy sward."

Giornata 4,"An old husband’s tale reckons that witches are children 
of sexless angels and their human eunuchs, angels 
whose self-restraint was inversely proportional to the power 
to silence their victims. Papa’s maybes of a Zeus-like
ravishment from above. Immaculate. Paul said women
should wear an “authority” on their heads, by which he meant a veil,
like a force field to protect them from lustful angels. Adam
copped angel lust from those self-same freaky mayflies
who by turns learned their grift at God’s extensive
digit bulbing like molten glass at the end of a blowpipe.
God got his from Greeks. Thus completes, like a network
of shell companies, the history of qualified
immunity. Every man should learn to balance a set of books
that looks like an anvil–instead of a veil–on our heads
for posture in the figurative sense, standing in God’s eyes
where God, like the future, is female—a prophylactic
against patriarchy, a cork stopper in the mouth of a gun.","Paul said women should wear an “authority’ on their heads, by which he meant a veil like a force field to protect them from lustful angels.

Somewhere Everywhere,"“I will take with me the emptiness of my hands
What you do not have you find everywhere”
             — W. S. Merwin
And the fireflies cried.
Only owl shrieks and wing howls
Now. And one once-upon town — ash.  —
When does a fire peel to reveal skin
Of a running child under its flame-raged arms —
Child legs too short to reach mama or  
Neighbor or any hands to save her?
Stilled hands. Not the town’s famed banyan  
Branches, their hundred twined and dancing arms.  
Not sky not sea not friend not that goddess her
Tutu taught her loved fire, but loved her, more —
Only her blister-scorched skin,  
Only her lost-slipper race,
Blind to a wind blacked 
Sea where she would dive or die.  
Too quiet now for night-birds
Mothers or men — to find.
Not immortal.  
Only one child of the land
And the many large and  
Small bones under ash.
                                             ~
It seemed immortal, the old ones
whispered, older than its wars
Or star of gladness seekers who
Crossed waters to follow midnights
To a far isle — in hollowed out trees
Filled with their chickens their pigs their
Plants and all their many brown hands 
— Landed —     Green island in
The middle of wild seas birthing
Oceans —     birthing mountains  
— Then mirror     to days of calm
To come.
Shine between sunrise,
Rain between gods, love between stars,
And red fish, and gods of trickery,
And gods of blessed breaths.
— Maui — island home for a hundred/
Hundred gardens, valleys, volcanoes, tall
Stones and skies — If immortal, why didn’t?
    — If blessed, why couldn’t — ?
                                           ~
  
When does fire lie quiet at
Last or at last — its non
Immortal breath burned like sunrise.  
Its gull cry     here      a new day?
Wake, storm birds, wake infant hands    
And wake, old ones — Wake,
Island — to plant what will
Grow from cinder and stinking ash.

wars of every kind. . . .

From “The Land” [Shepherds and stars are quiet with the hills],"Shepherds and stars are quiet with the hills.
There is a bond between the men who go
From youth about the business of the earth,
And the earth they serve, their cradle and their grave;
Stars with the seasons alter; only he
Who wakeful follows the pricked revolving sky,
Turns concordant with the earth while others sleep;
To him the dawn is punctual; to him
The quarters of the year no empty name.
A loutish life, but in the midst of dark
Cut to a gash of beauty, as when the hawk
Bears upwards in its talons the striking snake,
High, and yet higher, till those two hang close,
Sculptural on the blue, together twined,
Exalted, deathly, silent, and alone.
And since to live men labour, only knowing
Life’s little lantern between dark and dark,
The fieldsman in his grave humility
Goes about his centennial concerns,
Bread for his race and fodder for his kine,
Mating and breeding, since he only knows
The life he sees, how it may best endure,
(But on his Sabbath pacifies his God,
Blindly, though storm may wreck his urgent crops,)
And sees no beauty in his horny life,
With closer wisdom than soft poets use.
But I, like him, who strive
Closely with earth, and know her grudging mind,
Will sing no songs of bounty, for I see
Only the battle between man and earth,
The sweat, the weariness, the care, the balk;
See earth the slave and tyrant, mutinous,
Turning upon her tyrant and her slave,
Yielding reluctantly her fruits, to none
But most peremptory wooers.
Wherever waste eludes man’s vigilance,
There spring the weeds and darnels; where he treads
Through woods a tangle nets and trips his steps;
His hands alone force fruitfulness and tilth;
Strange lovers, man and earth! their love and hate
Braided in mutual need; and of their strife
A tired contentment born.","Shepherds and stars are quiet with the hills. There is a bond between the men who go about the business of the earth, and the earth they serve, their cradle and their grave."
If You Have Had Your Midnights,"        if you have had

Elegy: Boston,"August, one of those evenings I walked
the long way home, over the Harvard Bridge,
your image dissolving sweetly like a lozenge
on my tongue. This friendship, I reminded
myself, is everything but wrong.
In like with, not in love with: you.
I already had somebody, what else is there
to do? Suffer, and let the river air it out.
Like a spectator I hovered at the balustrade,
waiting for an early evening regatta,
bright sails, black keels cutting
beneath the railing, turning me
from my yearning, steeling my reeling
mind. Below, breezes herringboned
the rusty water, rush hour traffic knotted behind
me at the center of the bridge. These and other observations
I jotted in my journal, remembering your dark
fingers around my own like riggings, our calls,
brief torrents, anchoring my afternoons. Can I think
through your absence now, in words
as ungainly as these: Institute, 364.4 Smoots, abandoned band shell,
deleted emails, KS, Acyclovir? That night I stalled, not wanting to reach
Boylston, buy books and wine and candy and circle like a gull above
feeling. I stood there, as I sit here now, watching the red-brick
beacons beckoning dimming, like all desires, and loss itself, to mere horizon.","In like with, not in love with: you. I already had somebody, what else is there? Suffer, and let the river air it out. Can I think through your absence now?"
Try to Remember that South African Man,"Sometimes I try to remember the name of that South African man,
who insisted on being called “Coloured,” even though in this country
he would have qualified as “black.” He was more attached to that
identification than any other, such as “older,” “dapper,” “tourist,”
“uncut,” “speaks Afrikaans,” “wears glasses.” His hair slept under my
fingers like lambswool; he could tongue longer than any guy I’ve come
across thus far. What did we talk about as we lay on the comforter
in his hotel room? Getting around Boston on foot. How we’d both
considered studying architecture. Apartheid over there, racism here,
especially how Black Americans had achieved so much in comparison,
how we seemed to take everything for granted. Back and forth.
Imagine if just bitching about inadequate schools and lack of housing
could land you at the bottom of a ditch? he asked me. But it happens
here too, I protested. He smiled: respect your elders, even if they’re
lovers. Be quiet now, and then his palm covered my mouth and nose,
leaving only a tiny slit for me to breathe. This is how they held me
before they began to beat me, he said. Then he rained down another
round of kisses.","The writer and his girlfriend were visiting a friend in South Africa. They were staying in a hotel in Johannesburg. The friend, a black man, insisted on being called “Coloured”"

Beatitude,"Love everything
Love the sky and sea, trees and rivers,
            mountains and abysses.
Love animals, and not just because you are one.
Love your parents and your children,
            even if you have none.
Love your spouse or partner,
            no matter what either word means to you.
Love until you create a cavern in your loving,
            until it seethes like a volcano.
Love everytime.
Love your enemies.
Love the enemies of your enemies.
Love those whose very idea of love is hate.
Love the liars and the fakes.
Love the tattletales and the hypercrits, the hucksters and the traitors.
Love the thieves because everyone has thought
            of stealing something at least once.
Love the rich who live only to empty
            your purse or wallet.
Love the poverty of your empty coin purse or wallet.
Love your piss and sweat and shit.
Love your and others’ chatter and its proof of the expansiveness
            of nothingness.
Love your shadows and their silent censure.
Love your fears, yesterday’s and tomorrow’s.
Love your yesterdays and tomorrows.
Love your beginning and your end.
Love the fact that your end is another beginning,
            or could be, for someone else.
Love yourself, but not too much
            that you cannot love everything and everyone else.
Love everywhere.
Love in the absence of love.
Love the monsters breeding
            in every corner of the city and suburb,
            all throughout the soil of the countryside.
Love the monster breeding inside you and slaughter him
            with love.
Love the shipwreck of your body, your mind’s
            salted garden.
Love love.","Love the sky and sea, trees and rivers, mountains and abysses. Love animals, and not just because you are one. Love your parents and your children even if you have none. Love yourself, but not too much."
Furry Bear,"If I were a bear,
   And a big bear too,
I shouldn’t much care
   If it froze or snew;
I shouldn’t much mind
   If it snowed or friz—
I’d be all fur-lined
   With a coat like his!
For I’d have fur boots and a brown fur wrap,
And brown fur knickers and a big fur cap.
I’d have a fur muffle-ruff to cover my jaws,
And brown fur mittens on my big brown paws.
With a big brown furry-down up to my head,
I’d sleep all the winter in a big fur bed.","If I were a bear, I’d have fur boots and a brown fur wrap,                And brown fur knickers and a big fur cap.                With a big brown furry-down up to my head,                I’'d sleep all the winter in a bigfur bed."
Jesus in the Wilderness,"1.Temptation
I know you were weary those forty days 
in the wilderness. What was that wilderness like—
dry dust, and swirling wind, no colour, 
as the devil’s flowers do not give birth 
to seeds here? What is it to live in the forest 
of devil’s yarn, like a goat wild and yearning, 
tempted, strong of will yet weak of mind? 
What is it to want? What is temptation but yielding 
of flesh. How fast did your heart beat against 
ribcage in anger at these tantalising abominable 
lies. No one talks about limbs weakening, 
or rats gnawing your belly, lice in your hair, 
like in the belly of the ship, no one speaks 
about that. To build a saint, one needs to gloss 
over the body’s ordinariness, one needs
to forget there is mess and nastiness in the gut,
the dry throat swallowing saliva. The ache of spit
sliding along cracked lips and down your 
neck back. The way the stomach contracts, 
its punch all uneven, each like a xxx of fists.
  2. How not to drown in desire
day stretched like a bending river
day stretched and curled like a meandering river
when days began to stretch
when his days began to curl 
when his days became a meandering river
it’s undertow dragging him
when the days became deceptive, a river
meandering. It’s undertow
when his days became a meandering river
when his days began to curl into a river
when his days stretched and curled
when his days stretched, curling into a river
whose undertow dragged him weary to the surface
  3. Sufferation 
When his days stretched, curling into a river 
whose undertow ripped his skin right to the soul
he who believed, stood firm in dry dust, 
where flowers do not give birth from seeds, 
where wild goats stroll. No one talks 
of his trembling limbs, the gnawing rats 
in his gut, the fleas congregating to party
in his hair. No one talks of the reptile’s guffaw
as the Devil sucked succulent orange over forty
days and nights, while he who believed stitched 
then unpicked the stitches from his bloody lips
how the taunt of the orange juice ached 
his neck back in the ripe stench of the boat’s belly. 
How they gripe, the dry heaves scraping 
his neck back his belly swelling pregnant with emptiness. 
Since those days we fast in our thirst for salvation, 
long forgotten, the bloodied scar on his nailed palm.",Temptation and Sufferation are just a few of the themes explored in the book. The author also explores how not to drown in desire. The book is published by Bloomsbury.
Sojourner,"For the tread,
I am a farmer woman
From another field—
Hymn rise, fervid tend
For each tree. Bone
Crossing. Each.
Meal astride death
I made way
In the way light raptures
Through logs of sound. 
There, I trembled to knowledge.
And the bees glittered for me also.
I wanted a blue dress.
In the night, flies
In the lace of the trees—
A city
Where my breast culled clouds.

Through hollow

Peridot,"after Arthur Rimbaud and Wyatt Mason
       O for a few more of those pre-trauma days, when life was as dazzling as a piece of raw peridot and all my hours were grass stains and beach glass and sycamore leaves glinting and shifting and iris spears shooting up, up, up!
       And lime cordial, molten peridot, thick and gloopy as time in the bottom of a glass—sliding, coating. And a fresh bruise when a bruise was just a bruise and could fade. And the gloaming when even the gloaming was green—pear-green and freckled sky, mustachioed wisps.
       But he is here too—fission-green flaw deep within the facet—giving off his own glow, blinding, disorientating. A crystal kind of man, polymorph, because he still has something to teach me and I don’t know if I will ever truly learn it.
       Protective stone, keeper-away of evil spirits, where were you when I needed you? His touch was mantle-hot and ruinous; intrusive, extrusive.
       I am always looking for a new frequency—hoping to recover some peridot shard of myself in this lapidary of broken things—but I can only translate what is already here and not transform. Hats off to the crystallographer who is watching chartreuse ions precipitate into livid rocks, I am toxic—petrified ectoplasm—luminously bonded to my past.","""I am toxic—petrified ectoplasm—luminously bonded to my past"" ""I am always looking for a new frequency—hoping to recover some peridot shard of myself in this lapidary of broken things"""
Bogeymen,"I keep running from the bogeymen on my shelf
who did bad things and wrote great poems. I try not to feel
them become erect with the word great.
I close my eyes and thumb past the award seals
that silence women I love. What a lie to be alive!
To come so close to greatness, so close it knows
your name, and survive.",I keep running from the bogeymen on my shelfwho did bad things and wrote great poems. I try not to feel them become erect with the word great. What a lie to be alive!
If Night You Were a City,"I would return to you in a jacket of gold leaves 
drawn tight
against the city wind 
whipping around corners through button holes over
cobbled streets park lanes 
cordoned-off barbarian herds
of steel and glass and concrete ground zero for crowds 
of absence. We’d lift off beyond the brick
toward choked stars, moons outshined by neon 
and by anxious day, moons perched on dark spires
golden lions
we’d wrap our naïve wings around
to embrace the artifice of it all 
and the reality: the heat here is unbearable
and I miss the need to be warm, that need to look 
forward to nights alone with you with no morning on our minds
no time 
no need to claw through
restaurants packed with bridge and tunnel drunk 
on the filth and the beauty.
For here
there is no comparison
no autumn as autumn no snow to justify 
a hot drink or a fat meal the fish is delicious
and the beer even better but not the same. 
Some say the grass
is greener as if it’s law 
and more
that I try to recreate 
metropolis each time a baobab drops a beetle
to flee every time winter floods the sand 
to mute the night—
boats eclipsing the mainland sprawl 
trading with another language transformed before my ears:
tell me how you lived
your dream and I will tell you who you are 
every night, every single night and with a wingspan 
I resurrect in a cold sweat
and off in the distance 
there are drums
drums beating the island
like drums and outside the window an unexpected laugh
drums in concert
with the percussive horn
of the ferry to you.
There’s nothing romantic about this
nothing absolute I am reminded of
everything that went wrong everything that went right
and when I wake
if I wake, may the flash not wax
our feathers
may it not melt our wings","I would return to you in a jacket of gold leaves, I would say. We’d lift off beyond the brick grotesquetoward choked stars, moons outshined by neon. I miss the need to be warm, that need to look. There’s nothing romantic about this this city."
One Year ago—jots what? (296),"One Year ago—jots what?
God—spell the word! I—can’t—
Was’t Grace? Not that—
Was’t Glory? That—will do—
Spell slower—Glory—
Such Anniversary shall be—
Sometimes—not often—in Eternity—
When farther Parted, than the Common Woe—
Look—feed upon each other’s faces—so—
In doubtful meal, if it be possible
Their Banquet’s true—
I tasted—careless—then—
I did not know the Wine
Came once a World—Did you?
Oh, had you told me so—
This Thirst would blister—easier—now—
You said it hurt you—most—
Mine—was an Acorn’s Breast—
And could not know how fondness grew
In Shaggier Vest—
Perhaps—I couldn’t—
But, had you looked in—
A Giant—eye to eye with you, had been—
No Acorn—then—
So—Twelve months ago—
We breathed—
Then dropped the Air—
Which bore it best?
Was this—the patientest—
Because it was a Child, you know—
And could not value—Air?
If to be “Elder”—mean most pain—
I’m old enough, today, I’m certain—then—
As old as thee—how soon?
One—Birthday more—or Ten?
Let me—choose!
Ah, Sir, None!","One Year ago, a year ago, I was a boy. Today, I’m a man. I am a man, and I am proud to be so. I have come a long way."
Winter Song,"The browns, the olives, and the yellows died,
And were swept up to heaven; where they glowed
Each dawn and set of sun till Christmastide,
And when the land lay pale for them, pale-snowed,
Fell back, and down the snow-drifts flamed and flowed.
From off your face, into the winds of winter,
The sun-brown and the summer-gold are blowing;
But they shall gleam with spiritual glinter,
When paler beauty on your brows falls snowing,
And through those snows my looks shall be soft-going.","The browns, the olives, and the yellows died, and were swept up to heaven; where they glowed each dawn and set of sun till Christmastide. Through those snows my looks shall be soft-going."
Weathering Hate,"The way, exposed to weather, a body is worn. Velvet threads begin to
wither, rapid ripened beyond the burst bloom. Vibrant strands, cut short,
fray, unweaving faded fabric. Sun-struck, rain-warped, storm-blasted,
rough-sanded in whipping wind that whittles rock. 
Small, torturous fractures opened in stone where water freezes in the
pores with grains of salt. Cracks in the surface pried apart by unrelenting
pressure. With incessant freezing and thawing, shock and fatigue speed
rugged stress to ultimate breakdown. Intemperate weather, abrading
edges, gradually disintegrates resolute minerals. 
A boulder, even a mountain, will wear down. So will bodies, bent and
broken under toilsome burdens, caving beneath unbearable weight, in
adverse climate, exposed to harsh elements, caustic rains. ","A boulder, even a mountain, will wear down. So will bodies, bent and broken under toilsome burdens, caving beneath unbearable weight. The way, exposed to weather, a body is worn."
Expulsion,"                                             they are hurrying along, panting
these of the sort that for three thousand years have not imagined Isis Floating on a Stillstream, Isis in her exhaustion and despair, Isis deep in the seasons, regathering the pieces, mending, loving. Only a few years ago they spoke so often of what is still to come from “man,” “becomingly to be going to become”— 
                                                           watch this space
as if they had as yet no prescience of their doom. Behind them now are seas in tears, seas in flame. Barren ground belching gas. Rat droppings on a strawberry bedspread in a house with one wall. Not a soul in sight in any direction. No wonder they weep,
                                                 there falls some feel on them 
remembering the lethal smugness of being a corporatized subject before the punk opening of disaster, before they became wayweeds
                                                         objects before death 
with rictus smiles, viral hatreds, larvae on their tongues, phantom limbs climbing the rotten ladders of old hierarchies. They pass now, the open-carry let-freedom-hang-a-leftie swaggerers among them, rags of the Logos pulled down over their heads, having sawed through the green of the Islands of Breath,
                                        Dawn squatting to urinate on the grass
Listen, they are calling to God to save their souls, screaming for His intervention, weeping. But no ideal being of ardor order grace fairness would miss their species were it to vanish—and, for all its obscene clinging to itself, it will vanish. Like Agamemnon, these minuses—always at war and jealous of their property—“eat ruin.” Perhaps after a chastening apocalypse like this one, someone brandishing an LED torch (lol) may lead them to a spiritual disarmament. A spark, a rain cloud approaching, suspicions, theories—no, it wouldn’t last.","These of the sort have not imagined Isis Floating on a Stillstream, Isis in her exhaustion and despair, Isis deep in the seasons, regathering the pieces, mending, loving.

Porcelain Musician in a Child’s Bedroom,"Who can tell you not to mourn the dust?
      If you want to mourn the dust,

light sending circles to kaolin feet—

              not-music taken in—or

   history-or-imagination maker who

writing . . . When the music lessons 
     went less well, your mother settled
for your writing, you could say 
  settled like dust on porcelain but

Habitable Nebula,"The long night reminds me that so much of what it means
      to be a person shines through obscurity, like odd condiments
bought on impulse, tested once, then pushed to the back
     of the refrigerator in their smartly labeled bottles and jars.
It’s like a birth of stars, or nights an actor plays their part
     so flawlessly, the audience gives no thought to gastroenteritis
or its various causes (viruses, bacteria, bacterial toxins,
     parasites and so forth) till hours after the last act is dust.
But setting aside all that small stuff, there’s still the entirety
     of the past, invisible or visible only in traces, as among the blur
that sets in during speeches, or when speeding to the launch
     past signage that tries to communicate but by habit we ignore.
I still can’t say what life is for, but it can’t be to pretend
     that every part of it is knowable, or that what appears to be
to the naked eye or in the middle ground or documented on paper
     approximates a person any better than a daisy does our sun.
When at a loss for what I am, I know I must be feeling it
     deep in the layers, where a turbulence gives rise to clouds
so massive they collapse in a bliss of gravity, condensing into this
      music I can daisy into morning as it daisies me into morning.","It’s like a birth of stars, or nights an actor plays their part so flawlessly, the audience gives no thought to gastroenteritis or its various causes.

Journey of the Magi,"‘A cold coming we had of it,
Just the worst time of the year
For a journey, and such a long journey:
The ways deep and the weather sharp,
The very dead of winter.’
And the camels galled, sore-footed, refractory,
Lying down in the melting snow.
There were times we regretted
The summer palaces on slopes, the terraces,
And the silken girls bringing sherbet.
Then the camel men cursing and grumbling
And running away, and wanting their liquor and women,
And the night-fires going out, and the lack of shelters,
And the cities hostile and the towns unfriendly
And the villages dirty and charging high prices:
A hard time we had of it.
At the end we preferred to travel all night,
Sleeping in snatches,
With the voices singing in our ears, saying
That this was all folly.
Then at dawn we came down to a temperate valley,
Wet, below the snow line, smelling of vegetation;
With a running stream and a water-mill beating the darkness,
And three trees on the low sky,
And an old white horse galloped away in the meadow.
Then we came to a tavern with vine-leaves over the lintel,
Six hands at an open door dicing for pieces of silver,
And feet kicking the empty wine-skins,
But there was no information, and so we continued
And arrived at evening, not a moment too soon
Finding the place; it was (you may say) satisfactory.
All this was a long time ago, I remember,
And I would do it again, but set down
This set down
This: were we led all that way for
Birth or Death? There was a Birth, certainly,
We had evidence and no doubt. I had seen birth and death,
But had thought they were different; this Birth was
Hard and bitter agony for us, like Death, our death.
We returned to our places, these Kingdoms,
But no longer at ease here, in the old dispensation,
With an alien people clutching their gods.
I should be glad of another death.","The author travelled to the Middle East in search of a new home. He describes the journey as 'hard and bitter agony for us, like Death, our death'"
"[A rose has thorns as well as honey,]","A rose has thorns as well as honey,
I’ll not have her for love or money;
An iris grows so straight and fine,
That she shall be no friend of mine;
Snowdrops like the snow would chill me;
Nightshade would caress and kill me;
Crocus like a spear would fright me;
Dragon’s-mouth might bark or bite me;
Convolvulus but blooms to die;
A wind-flower suggests a sigh;
Love-lies-bleeding makes me sad;
And poppy-juice would drive me mad:—
But give me holly, bold and jolly,
Honest, prickly, shining holly;
Pluck me holly leaf and berry
For the day when I make merry.","I’ll not have her for love or money;An iris grows so straight and fine,                That she shall be no friend of mine. A rose has thorns as well as honey."
"Hail, Mary","Buon giorno, buen dia Maria
Full of grace and wisdom and power
The Lord may be with thee, and you
May be Blessed among women but
What about the children? Not the one
In the womb that has been consecrated
As the son of God, but God, your god,
My god has many sons, daughters all
Around the world. They are not all blessed
Some are cursed and lost and under a pile
Of rubble in Ukraine, Yemen, Israel, Palestine, Gaza;
Others live in the darkness of the blind, are
Plagued by hallucinations, cursed with spasms
Of a mind that plays tricks on them all day, all
Night. Imagine a predator behind you, in your
Shadow, silent, stealthy, looking over your shoulder
Or under your bed. You cannot see but you know
They are there and they mean you harm for no
Other reason than you are where you find yourself
Not for an act you perpetrated on someone else,
Just for being who you are. The luck of the draw?
And Holy Mary, Mother of God, do you pray for
The innocent as well as the sinners? The pilots,
The soldiers firing artillery rockets, are they too
Prayed for? Rockets with ranges of 30-50 miles, fired
In barrages for the most effect, the most damage.
Are they too in your prayers to god and which god
Might that be? What does that God look like, what
Does that god think, plan, why does that god never
intervene? Humans shooting hate and rockets blindly
into Ashkelon, Beersheba, under the eyes of Israeli 
drones … range is crucial for rockets, for prayers too.
Pray for us sinners and for the innocent, for my own son
Living in a world plagued with demons he cannot see
or touch or hear but knows they are there, so music
and words come to him as if a shaft of light in day
Or night, raises his voice above the din in his brain, to
Feel the lift above the iron dome of paranoia, the upsurge
Of spirits that haunt, and fly, and invade his small cot in an
Institution with cinder block walls, netted windows he can’t
See but knows they are there: the limitations, the lack
Of liberty, the outside in; the other sons and daughters
in Gaza, or Yemen or Ukraine are bombarded with a panoply
of air power used in a steadily escalating series of attacks.
What I wish for my own son is comfort, warmth, knowing
There is a meal, a roof over his head, a dog at his feet, a
Sun he can feel but not see… Mother of God, what do you
Wish for your sons, your daughters now and at the hour
Of their deaths? When will your god hear your pleas or
Have the mothers and daughters been silenced to the
Tunnels, the basements, the streets, have they lost their
Voices, their powers to heal, now and at the hour of now?","The writer asks: 'What do you wish for your sons, your daughters now and at the hour of their deaths?' 'When will your god hear your pleas or have the mothers and daughters been silenced to the streets?' 'What I wish for my own son is comfort, warmth, knowing there is a meal, a roof over his head, a dog at his feet, aSun he can feel but not see'"
Juan Goytisolo Dies on a Ramadan Sunday in Marrakesh,"His country was language,

Prose them into first novel.

Falcons on shoulders, diviners,
Pack of cards….destiny,
Barkers selling whatever,
Beggars, balloons float, children, women
Musk drifts along Plaza Fna,
Thieves every crevice scheme,
Shadows of swift hands,

[The will to see oneself as fragile],"The will to see oneself as 
fragile, fallible, 
liable to fail. 
To consider a stranger and 
hear, in the mind’s ear, 
one’s true voice
insisting: I must change.
Ordinary people do this
Patient urgent work
alone and together
day upon day upon day.
Like my mother, once,
leading her ailing mother 
back through the maze 
of our suburban scrawl,
past ache, past haze, 
past confusion and rage
toward a neat room
where waited prayer,
fear, forgiveness, 
grief, grace. This
is a poem about kin 
and neighbors and nations 
adrift, in error, under siege.

Fog,"All day the air was fog;

Youmna lies

Not Yet,"When my father breathed

When I saw my father’s tears
I did not pray;
I hated our market
where the bullet
missed his heart,
I hoped the mists exhaled
by the Vale of Esk
in a country of lakes
four thousand miles away
would be mine.
That was before
Lopez whispered through his rotten teeth
behind a maze of welding guns,
“You’re colored, like me,”
before I knew
so much anger,
so much need
to avenge the holy cross
and the holy card
with its prayers for the dead,
so many words
I have no choice to say.
Years without enough to make me
stop talking—
I want it all.
I don’t want
the angel inside me, sword in hand,
to be silent.

The Economy,"for Terry Tempest Williams
I didn’t love
That I had this
Tendency
Toward melody
Or the appetite for drama
Always obvious
In my thinking
& in everything
I did. I wasn’t TV
Though I watched myself
Sometimes passively
As though brained or
Bludgeoned out of the fullness
Of my own reality. I felt
I had to respect what seduced me
Even if stupidly—even when it made
Me stupid—or meant I was—
Making of my mind a begging bowl
Laying myself waste for the devil
Making an innocent victim of the child within
So ferociously did I fear
Something adult, like sovereignty
Survival was a big-
Box-store-bought
Blanket. Not wet
But scented
With the antiseptics
Of the factory
It would take days
To air out, get it to resemble
The picture of something homey
And grandmother-made
I know what it’s like to pay
Money for such.
The three-dimensional
Image of things. To find
Them feeling hollow and smelling
Wrong. I know what it’s like.
The imitation of life.
I almost know what it means.
I disciplined my own form and the thinking
Within me. That may not be a religion
But it is grim theology.
The more muscle I had the better
I felt I could contain and conduct
The sorrow within. The smoother
Ran my blood and lymph.
My body dismayed me and I hated,
Adored it. Recurrent dreams
Of defective dolls kept coming back
To warn me. You are not a thing.
You are not the object against which forces
Tilt that you cannot control.
You are the entire subject of the world.
Tears rolled down a cheek of stone
My friend Terry writes about water
And land, mother and brother
Like a singer. I once despaired
To her that the only endangered
Species I had managed to speak
On behalf of up to that moment
Was myself. This seemed squalid
And narrow to me. Terry said it was real
Territory. I blinked melancholy
Into the seething night
Like a spotted owl in the eye
Of a security camera
Black and white bird without
Offspring or prey. My body
Is filled with plastic
I left my mother to die
To write these lines
You will parry that such is a false
Economy. But so
Are all the other ones we live by",For Terry Tempest Williams: ‘I had to respect what seduced me. I wasn’t TVThough I watched myself passively passively passively. I disciplined my own form and the thinkingWithin me’
The Patient Ones,"I’m staring out the window, but this is not my father’s depression

Theorem of Sorts,"We admire adults for not acting like children, 
meaning we don’t have to clean up after them, 
while we spend at least half of a life trying 
to find ways to exceed the edges 
of shapes that cannot be found. 
At the dinner table he brings up the guy 
who “does these beautiful magical dioramas,”
micro-grated Parmesan cheese dangling
from the dinged edge of a bowl covered in oil. 
Later that week folding pages at the art school 
keeps us occupied. Notes are taken and much is said
while repetition begins fielding itself.

American goldfinches and cardinals, 
migratory and nonmigratory respectively, 
the latter mostly male and so territorial

You won’t find the difference between a peaceful being 
and being peaceful on differencebetween.net. 
Other approaches are requisite, body scans. 
If your heartbeat can’t be found under the medical gown
the shutdown’s become emotional for you.
This is the likely end to a year we want
to forget or the one forgetting itself as it is coming 
to an end. Except that it isn’t, ongoingness
has its way of “keeping on keeping on,” not even 
when it all stops, since the so-called ending folds itself
into the ever-developing story, begging the question, 
is it airless, the POV? Who sees the narrator?
Is this relatable and on whose terms? 
The proposal involves switching mediums. 
I will play a faculty member at the art school 
on whose faculty I am serving, folding
myself as a fictional character into a true story.  
In the vicinity, the charm of hummingbirds, 
murder of crows, and identity taxation.

against icons. A flexible field trip to nowhere. 
When one painter speaks to another painter, I know 
that to be fully in this won’t ever be available to me either,

yet somehow we manage to communicate.

To think of blisters when I wear 
A new shirt. At fourteen, he thinks

When I was small, I’d walk 
Those fields with them in that sun.  
I’d tilt and tilt my head to find

Sheep in Winter,"The sheep get up and make their many tracks
And bear a load of snow upon their backs,
And gnaw the frozen turnip to the ground
With sharp quick bite, and then go noising round
The boy that pecks the turnips all the day
And knocks his hands to keep the cold away
And laps his legs in straw to keep them warm
And hides behind the hedges from the storm.
The sheep, as tame as dogs, go where he goes
And try to shake their fleeces from the snows,
Then leave their frozen meal and wander round
The stubble stack that stands beside the ground,
And lie all night and face the drizzling storm
And shun the hovel where they might be warm.","The sheep get up and make their many tracks, gnaw the frozen turnip to the ground, and then go noising round. The boy that pecks the turnips all the day knocks his hands to keep the cold away."

Libros de Arena,"So I open a book
A row of camels marches out,
The Sahara such infinite sand
Like the sky on land,
Where waves of dunes design motion,
Camel wants me jump upon its back,
Go riding gallop the letters of its words,
Who together compose music
Based upon an air that frames arithmetic,
Images from where they were
Prior to focus, just move through special
Terrain of pebbles in perpetuity, a date palm
Leans in the nowhere path of a lizard
Snake skin sunshine, eats a scorpion, 
Of everyday fathom air
Endure light pierce,
What dance of golden sand breasts, nothing
Seeing such oblivion, elapsed glances
Invisible book appears,
Which never occurs in a trillion years?
When a moment surprises itself and
Becomes the view light unaware,
Nothing forecast,
To close the book
Return to the silence
Of the sand heaven
Which rains from my fingers?
In the dry of motion. Sound.
So much space, 
Where is she,
Where
When? ","The Sahara is a vast expanse of sand and water. It is home to camels, dunes and the desert landscape. The Sahara is also a place of great beauty and wonder."
The Californian Book of the Dead,"I’m scared, so I’m writing this book of the dead, 
a last testament, like James Kidd, Arizona prospector
mining the edge of Superstition Wilderness, 
maybe murdered in Haunted Canyon for his gold, 
whose will left his half million to research the spirit
because “I think in time we will photograph the soul 
leaving the human at death.”  Perhaps we will, or perhaps
there’s no will left when the body, sleeplike, settles 
and the mind breaches, and the last neurons flaring in a final
visionary chain try to understand the storm wind ripping us 
from our bodies, the million tiny Buddhas crawling down 
the eyelids, white buddhas, red buddhas, blue and yellow.
The teenager daydreams super powers, walking invisible
into the girls’ locker room and bank vaults, a super punch
that sends the football jocks sprawling, but doesn’t dream
of the body’s simplest power—the power to stop.
The body has its own will, and so I leave this testament.
Crack wide the doors of the sky, let my spirit leap 
into heaven like a grasshopper, let me float among the stars 
and eat the gods, and when I stand before the lords of death 
I’ll testify that I leapt from the pit of dreams each morning 
and tried to live my life awake, that I gave twenty dollars 
to the woman by the freeway entrance with the Homeless 
and Humiliated sign while the red truck honked behind me, 
that I bowed my head and dug with my tongue 
between my lover’s legs, that I mined that cave 
and the gold for me was the pleasure she felt, but I did not 
sleep with that woman at the French bistro who was so bored 
of her husband and her little girls. I lived the best I could. 
And if the mind breaks down in death, and the last neuron
fires in darkness like a sun snuffed out in a dying galaxy,
and if I wander for a while alone and find no god,
no rat, no earthworm, no butterfly of the spirit realm,
then let this be my superpower, the ability to speak
without breath, to write without fingers, to streak like
a meteorite across a black screen, and to go on and on
without will or consciousness, just these dead words
dancing before your eyes, a toy skeleton on a string.","The body has its own will, and so I leave this testament. I’ll testify that I leapt from the pit of dreams each morning.

Parable of the Jew without a Name,"“With our despised immigrant clothing, we shed also our impossible Hebrew names.” —Mary Antin, The Promised Land  (1912)
My great-uncle Vincent, son of the Milk Street tailor, 
threw some fairy dust into the air and changed, 
making it easy for me to go to the prom, 
to grow up in Indiana and bite my tongue 
when a hick would cuss at the bastard who tried 
to Jew me down on the price for home-grown pot. 
Like wool pants for blue jeans, Moshe, Shmuel and Lazar 
traded in their names, and in exchange were changed 
from cabbage-eaters into Americans, and why not? 
“I never was a pumpkin!,” cries the carriage. 
“I never was a pauper!,” shouts the prince.
In this fairy tale all the steins turn into stones, straw turns 
to gold, stars warp into crosses, and the pauper trades up 
and leaves the trades to the star-crossed Jews. 
I’m a lousy Jew, ignorant of nearly everything 
except that in another time the Klan would lynch me, 
the Nazis flay me into yellow lampshades. 
My white hide hides me, my baseball cap keeps greasy ash 
out of my hair, and I’m glad for my nice name. 
Who needs a life so grim? In the shtetl, the old Jews 
would change their names so the Angel of Death 
flying on black crape wings above the town, 
fatal list in hand, would pass over them
—but not the ones who stayed behind 
and kept their names, the Adelsteins, Eisensteins 
or the one I’ll never know, some cousin twice removed 
born in Poland, some Maurice Bernstein. No way to gather 
smoke out of the sky and give him flesh again. 
I imagine him, with eyes like mine, intent 
and studious, staring at the rusted cattle-car wall 
in the rattling stink of packed bodies, trying not to breathe. 
He’ll get that wish soon enough. 
Slender, bookish children aren’t good workers 
and it’s too much trouble to take away their names 
and write numbers in their skin. 
They’re gassed like fleas. 
I’m a lousy Jew, but I’d like to disturb the grass, 
unearth him from the crowded grave, and let his damp fingers 
write this story, while his eyes like clouded marble roll. 
I’d like to roll the story back to the dead boy 
swaying in the train, to see him there imagining the sky 
he hasn’t seen for days, the white winter sky, like a page 
he could write on again and again, practicing his name.","“I’m a lousy Jew, ignorant of nearly everything, except that in another time the Klan would lynch me,” writes Mary Antin. “With our despised immigrant clothing, we shed also our impossible Hebrew names.” “I imagine him, with eyes like mine, intent, staring at the rusted cattle-car wall, trying not to breathe,’ she writes."
The 167th Psalm of Elvis,"Blessed are the marble breasts of Venus, 
those ancient miracles, for they are upright and milk white 
and they point above the heads of the crowd in the casino.
Blessed are the crowds that play, and whose reflections 
sway in the polish of her eggshell eyes, 
for they circle like birds around the games, 
and they are beautiful and helpless.
Bless the fast glances that handle the waitress,
bless her miniskirt toga and the flame-gold scotch, 
and bless the gamblers who gaze at the stage.
Remember also the dancer and remember her dance,
her long neck arched like a wild white goose,
the tassels on her nipples that shoot like sparks,
and bless the legs and bless the breasts            
for they are fruit and honey and they are generous to the eyes.
Have mercy on my wallet, the dollars I punch into the slot,
and grace the wheels swapping clubs and hearts.
Mercy on me too, as I stumble as if in a hashish haze
watching the reels spin away, for I am a blown fuse
and I need someone to bless me before it’s too late.
Honor the chance in a million, the slot machine jolting,
the yellow light flashing, honor the voice that calls jackpot, 
and the coins that crush into the brushed steel tray,
for there is a time for winning and a time for losing
and if you cast your bread upon the waters
you will find it again after many days.
Pity the crowd around the blessed winner 
all patting his back as if it rubs off, 
this juice, this force, this whatever
that might save them from their own cursed luck.
And pity the poor winner whose hand claws back 
into his bucket of coins and who cannot walk away, 
because he’d do anything for the feeling 
he had when the great pattern rose from the chaos
of cherries and lemons and diamonds and stars
and he knew for that moment he was blessed.
 ","Blessed are the crowds that play, and whose reflections sway in the polish of her eggshell eyes,                 and they are beautiful and helpless. Blessed are the marble breasts of Venus, those ancient miracles, for they are upright and milk white."

who really was my great-grandfather,
had me thrust upon him at the nursing home,
long enough for two photos to be taken.
His mental state so deteriorated
he could have been holding a sack of drooling yams
for all that it mattered.
And it did to those taking the photograph.
The other felled by a stroke at his butchershop,
came back grumpy, iron-fisted and older-fashioned.
He doted on us, his grandsons;
we were teens, half-formed blobs,
and he never saw who we would become, or how we would.
My father did not live long enough to see his
only grandchild grow up.
                 (He would not even know of the others
                 down the line, nor they of them.)
And at some pin-prick point in time,
this little sweetness of a child
will have no real memory of her grandfather
or later, of me.
She will wonder who her grandfather was,
not remembering how he beamed Cheshire-cat like
whenever she was around, how he carried and doted on her
like he never did with his own children,
how he lugged her kiddie table across two statelines
strapped to the roof of his car, how he drove
105 miles to get her favorite shoes specially re-soled.
She will wonder who this uncle of hers was,
not remembering that soap-bubble blowing toy monkey
from Camden Market that caused two full-scale baggage searches
at two airports, and how delighted she was
lying in front of Bubble Monkey while he did his thing.
Will she remember the swimming lessons? the games of shark-horsey?
or the bedtime stories he made up,
and how for weeks she kept searching for those stories
in all her books, insisting to her father
that the stories were there. Will she remember
the tireless hours he spent playing tea party with her?
Or will she outgrow those tea parties and ballet-dancing mice,
forsake them in favor of the mall and best friends,
lipsticks and nylons;
                and I’ll be dimmed,
worn as a Post-It note, the writing in an unfamiliar hand,
on its last sticks, barely clinging
to a basket of already broken,
dis-used and outgrown toys.

Winter,"Cold, moist, young phlegmy winter now doth lie
In swaddling clouts, like new-born infancy;
Bound up with frosts, and fur’d with hail & snows,
And, like an infant, still it taller grows.
December is my first, and now the sun
To the southward Tropick his swift race doth run.
This month he’s hous’d in horned Capricorn,
From thence he ’gins to length the shortened morn,
Through Christendom with great festivity,
Now’s held (but guessed) for blest Nativity.
Cold, frozen January next comes in,
Chilling the blood, and shrinking up the skin.
In Aquarius now keeps the long-wish’d sun,
And northward his unwearied course doth run.
The day much longer than it was before,
The cold not lessened, but augmented more.
Now toes and ears, and fingers often freeze,
And travelers their noses sometimes leese.
Moist snowy February is my last,
I care not how the winter-time doth haste.
In Pisces now the golden sun doth shine,
And northward still approaches to the line.
The rivers ’gin to ope, the snows to melt,
And some warm glances from his face are felt;
Which is increased by the lengthen’d day,
Until by’s heat, he drive all cold away.
And thus the year in circle runneth round;
Where first it did begin, in th’ end its found.","December is my first, and now the sun                To the southward Tropick his swift race doth run. Cold, moist, young phlegmy winter now doth lie, like new-born infancy;                Bound up with frosts, and fur’d with hail & snows."

Gutted,"My favorite children’s bedtime prayer
is the one that goes:
                 Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John,
                 The bed be blest that I lie upon,
                 Four angels to my bed,
                 Four angels around my head,
                 One to watch and one to pray,
                 And two to bear my soul away.
This is such a vast improvement
over the more popular,
                 Now I lay me down to sleep,
                 I pray the Lord my soul to keep.
                 If I should die before I wake,
                 I pray the Lord my soul to take.
The difference is that
in one, you get to go
to bed with four men.
But in both, the child is afraid
he will die in the middle
of the night in his sleep.

Later, the child will grow up
and realize the lie hidden 
in those prefabricated prayers.
That is what most people want:
to die in your sleep,
to die in your own bed.","The difference is that in one, you get to go to bed with four men. But in both, the child is afraid he will die in the middle of the night in his sleep."

Family Secret,"Too many cracks precede 
the spectacular breaking. Each 
story begins in a different dark-
ness. And light: think how it catches
on any surface (pane or 
hinge or keyhole) and 
out of night (out of nothing), 
all at once: a window, 
a door. It’s a metaphor 
(and then it isn’t), darkness. 
When I dream again
it’s the old kitchen—I 
open the oven and sound, 
like ropes of heat, drifts 
out; a shimmering. Familiar 
and confusing. Uncanny,
and then unmistakable: our 
voices, recorded. Playback 
and loop, now—every aching 
word we whispered here.","Each  story begins in a different dark-                ness. And light: think how it catches on any surface (pane or keyhole) and  out of night (out of nothing) All at once: a window, a door, a metaphor, and then it isn't."
Ode to Goby,"Here, floating with the water
I escape. I float. I immerse in the richness 
of the forest; fade into the dark greens
of the ferns and reeds of the shore,
the light greens of the new leaves on the trees,
the water rushing, and oh the bird calls too.
Came to sedate, cleanse, escape.
Came to clear out my dreams
filled with bears that each night enter 
my room, tearing it apart
so as to let me know there aren’t enough
fish this year and likely the next too.
Came for water so clear 
that I could wash, that I could see. 
Came to see a goby, 
a blue, a purple, a turquoise 
too when seen from the side,
then a clear that is as a pink when it turns. 
Even as it is getting dark so fast 
that there is almost nothing left to see 
still, we together swim on, into some world
not yet imagined, not yet understood.
Oh goby, I am sorry we have made things 
so impossible for you, for all of us.
Sorry that we have done so much that 
you are few; sorry to be so lost, imageless, 
confused; sorry that I do not know how to be 
other than Grendel, swamp-like, dwelling in fen 
and moorland, up to his knees in the water
wandering the outskirts of town, angry, 
unforgiving of those who still find happiness 
amidst loss. Goby, even the very things 
that would cure us we put at risk: 
the tall tapering racemes of white midsummer
flowers on wiry black-purple stems 
that is the black cohosh; the blood red sap 
of the bloodroot and its small white petals that 
open up in sunlight; the hairy deep purple
stems of the goldenseal that support two hand-shaped leaves.
This world that once was so much, now less.
This world that was once a luminous archive 
of things evolved and adapted in slow moving 
specificity. This world that Césaire wrote 
when there was the possibility
that it might turn some other way than the nation, 
a world not of enclosure but of predatory 
celebration, liberation, a world of the sparrowhawk, 
the cynocephalus, the dolphins, and the wolves 
who feed in the untamed openings.
Fled is that music, that world, that rhetorical question 
and yet we continue on, angry, unforgiving, unsure.",Césaire’s ‘Goby’ is a short story by the French writer. The story is set in a swamp-like area of moorland in France.
The Crying of Water,"O water, voice of my heart, crying in the sand,
All night long crying with a mournful cry,
As I lie and listen, and cannot understand
The voice of my heart in my side or the voice of the sea,
O water, crying for rest, is it I, is it I?
All night long the water is crying to me.
Unresting water, there shall never be rest
Till the last moon droop and the last tide fail,
And the fire of the end begin to burn in the west;
And the heart shall be weary and wonder and cry like the sea,
All life long crying without avail,
As the water all night long is crying to me.","O water, voice of my heart, crying in the sand,                All night long crying with a mournful cry,                As I lie and listen, and cannot understand.

Home Brew,"Woman, Evansville, Indiana
He never drank a lick before the war

from fruit and then get bombed among the dead.

to someone moaning to himself at night,

inside, his spirit bottled up. One night
last year I woke up with his hands around 
my throat. His mouth was moving. He was dreaming.
I thumbed him in the eyes till he came round
and when he understood he broke down weeping.
He put his medals in a box. It’s done,
he said, and got a drink. It wasn’t done.

thing in the world. I’d sneak up into range
and throw a flame in, just a burst. A burst

and then they burn alive or suffocate.

I felt nothing. I did my job. No hate,
no nothing. The men liked me, called me Hot Shot.
But it meant nothing when the Nips would rush
out, clothes on fire and smoking, and we’d shoot
them dead. It meant we lived. Nothing to gush
about. I don’t have anything to hide.

Grace under Pressure,"U.S. Marine, Iwo Jima, 1945
When the potato masher hand grenade
flew in the hollow, Mark, the quiet boy,
looked at me with such sorrow. Then he lay
down on the thing. He knew his death would buy
our lives, and so he spent it all, just tossed
his future in the pot like a big spender
in Vegas. Damn him, who can pay that loss
off? I can’t. “Neither borrower nor lender”
was what my pop taught me. For what he gave
with rag doll arms spread wide when the bomb blew
him off the earth, I kissed his dirty face,
closed his dead eyes. I knew I had to live
my life a cleaner way, the way he flew
into the sky (before he fell). With grace.

until we clogged the beach, and then—all hell,

gun fire, artillery. I swear each shell
passed close enough you could reach up and catch
it like a ball. I crawled across black sand,
and used each corpse for cover. Don’t attach
yourself, is what I learned. Push it down and
crawl in a hole. Go numb, and you’ll survive,
maybe, as I survived. I didn’t hate

My arms shall welcome you when other arms are tired;
I stand to wait for you, patient in the darkness,
Offering forgetfulness of all that you desired.

I can love heavy lids and lips without their rose;
Though you are sorrowful you will not weary me;
I will not go from you when all the tired world goes.

I promise faithfulness no other lips may keep;
Safe in my bridal place, comforted by darkness,
You shall lie happily, smiling in your sleep.","I am the Dark Cavalier; I am the Last Lover. I ask no merriment, no pretense of gladness. I can love heavy lids and lips without their rose. I will not go from you when all the tired world goes."
Moth Madness,"Moths circle the kerosene lamp
     on the floor that
     sheds a dim light on our night work.
     My cousin and I keep carding the wooly clumps.
     Twigs and dirt that clung to the sheep
     from their wanderings among sagebrush and thistle
     drop into our laps.
     We card and card to transform them
     into layers of soft clouds for Nalí’s spindle.
Iich’ąhii says Nalí, almost in a whisper,
     like she was afraid to stir the name,
     like the name might release something formed from night.
Iich’ąhii, the word flutters
     in the shadows and cautions
     against all that is unbalanced in the Glittering World,
     the reckless, the violators, the amoral,
     evil floating all around
     that must be righted with songs and prayers.
Baa’hádzid! She exclaims, no longer whispering.
     Harsh caution against a suicidal jump into the fire.
     I would learn what it means to yearn
     for the fire burning in a stranger, the coup de foudre,
     that matched my own moth madness.
Nalí’s spindle tilts, like the earth’s axis,
     she places against her thigh
     spins intensely,
     as she transforms clouds of wool
     into layers upon layers of streaks
     for her canvas that becomes her world.
     She calls the earth and sky;
     She calls stories of female mountains;
     She calls stories of male mountains;
     She calls geometric designs to her
     to balance the world against
     the moth madness.
  Nalí–paternal grandmother
Iich’ąhii–moth insect
Baa’hádzid–used to denote something fearful","Moths circle the kerosene lamp on the floor that sheds a dim light on our night work.

Refugees in Our Own Land,"The night is busy with the growth of stars.  Above us peaceful.  Shiyáázh, my son, fusses in his cradleboard.  The protective rainbow shaped by his father arches over his face to protect him.  In the dark sand below Monster Slayer’s archenemy rises again to pull us off this rock where we’ve taken refuge since winter’s approach.
The wind stops.  Clouds drift across the moon.  We pull water silently from below near the soldier’s feet.  Silence is our cover.  I pull my son close and place my hand on my baby’s cheek to quiet him.  “Shhh, shee’awéé’, shiyázhí, shhh.”  Hush, baby, my beloved, hush.  With my finger I circle the pulse just above his ear.  He makes tiny lapping sounds with his mouth and turns toward my breast for the comfort of my milk.  But my breast is a sieve from which the enemy drinks.  I am dry.
These hands that mixed bread dough for the evening meal, that planted corn and gathered pollen from the tender shoots.  These hands held my husband’s kisses and caressed my baby’s soft bones as he grew inside me.  We sailed the river that led us to the ocean of all beginnings.  The night cries like an owl.  My beloved son’s eyes are full of stars.  A drowning breath in his throat.  Take this map of rainbows and fly, fly, child.","Shiyáázh, my son, fusses in his cradleboard.

Hanging,"We never let it mean by the throat,

that cargo unnamed, 
disremembered, off 
a West Indian coast—no:

to chandeliers overhead,  
decorations tastefully framed,

from careful arms, or a chair: 
along with odd ornaments

fanged, death’s proximity limited 
to the headboard crucifix

is quietly passing, among off-
season carolings, tokens 
of her family’s small well-to-do;
that one high shelf, where 
mementos will go. Let all 
other echoes let go, losing
traction on each slant 
of décor and rhyme, every
struck chime unanswering

The Land of Nod,"The night after she returned from the hospital 
the uneven rumbly liquid breathing of one soon  
to go under kept me at the surface of thoughts 
I couldn’t escape. Clonazepam, Lorazepam, 
not even Ambien could pull or sink me. And in the morning, 
sure enough, we couldn’t coax or shake her awake  
except for a few seconds when someone or thing  
wrenched her eyes open and let her answer no 
to every question in a scornful voice we’d never heard before 
before pulling her down to that rocky undertow. 
Through the morning and afternoon every breath, 
a grunt, a rattling that soaked the bedclothes and pillows in sweat. 
Then at 3 pm, she returned—recognizing her two daughters 
speaking her own name and the name of the president. 
The hospice nurse put a line through the word “Comatose” 
scrawled at the top of her chart and for the next few hours 
a light or absence seemed to emanate from her almost 
emptied irises. No sentences. No speech as the white  
nimbus of hair, thick and lively around her head 
nodded yes to sitting up and getting dressed— 
to sweet potatoes and Jeopardy! as though part of her  
remained in that rheumy underwater place 
that took her breath away and wiped out the syntax  
of explanation and inquiry, leaving only 
no I won’t and certainly not and don’t ever wake me up again.

were okay. But we shared our shakes

ourselves renegades in that room.

Bondage Device: Cross,"Gelatin silver print, Hal Fischer, 1977
I swear, this filthy light could pass clean
            through me. My body—stretched & strung
across a wooden cross. Counterfeit
            Christ, corset abandoned in the corner.
There’s a precision to the intimacy
            of this ritual; strangers’ vicarious
hunger for gentle violence; being made
            a spectacle in a room filled up with spectacle.
It takes a measure of restraint. A precise
            velocity & angle to make wood or leather
into thunder. Snap & paint a red horizon
            on my spine, my ass, my chest, or thighs.

Dom & sub, whip & cross & crowd, create
            a lexicon of their desires. Even the image
desires something—witness. When asked
            why he took the pictures of bondage gear
without a body in the frame, Fischer said:

In an Operating Room Outside of the Cis Woman’s Imagination,"In response to Sharon Olds’ poem “Outside the Operating Room of the Sex-Change Doctor”
            In an operating room outside of the cis woman’s imagination,
no tray of organs—severed.
            No blood for her to leaden with a massacre’s name.
After anesthesia, nothing is removed. Nothing wasted. Instead, skin
budded inward, a rose blooming into its own mouth.
            While the patient is still sedated, the doctor scalpels genesis,
sutures her body toward the truth.
            There is no organ severed & named a weapon for the convenience
of a body’s disposal.
            No organ severed & speaking at all. Made a puppet in the lazy
pantomime of metaphor.
            If anything is cut away, let it be the word his from the tip
of the cis woman’s tongue. Let it be her tongue.
            If anything speaks, let it be the new & perfect organ, who says
I was a Georgia O’Keefe painting dressed in drag & now, darlings
see how I bloom, how my petals slowdance the breeze.
            The cis woman’s severed tongue says nothing—least of all
to name trans women animals.

that I believe the tongue would whisper I’m sorry, I’m sorry.

quinceañeras at the bodega
with their pretty pink dresses
luscious dark eyes
longing to cut the Valencia cakes
while Mr. Softee lingers
over coco helados y piragüeros
fighting for the last dollar
Across the street,
santeros dressed in white
with their collares
buying chickens at the poultry shop
for their next tambor

back and forth
keeping the dealers in check
as the sounds of beepers

to gray-haired old men

at Paul’s boutique

pregnant with her second baby
only 18 & already night manager at McDonald’s

in the empty little crack bags
she counted
every morning
on her way to Grover Cleveland High School
Hector, her boyfriend,
home from playing handball all day
lying shirtless on the couch blunted out of his mind
staring at the roach on the ceiling
one single roach in a vast desert
or maybe an alien exploring a new world
the ceiling fan—
his spaceship
Doña Carmen sneezing so loud
the walls so thin
Hector says ‘Salud’
& she hears him from the second floor
over Walter Mercado
on Canal 41
Turning off the kitchen lights
so that the roaches can scurry into the darkness—
their freedom
like the children playing out all night
Waiting for the L train
‘Mira, Georgie...
Gimme a quarter!’
‘Fine...
but cha betta pay me back tomorrow!’

Legendary,"There are Gods amongst us in these ghettos
so black, so fierce, 
so brown, so beautiful, 
Their time on earth 
may be as oppressive as ignorance
limited to the demons flowing in their blood
but after safely passing over back to the clouds
the wind will still carry their auras and prophecies
their bones will still beat drums 
for their children to dance
the phoenix will still rise from the flames of Paris with hope in womb
There are Gods amongst us in these ghettos
so brown, so fierce, 
so black, so beautiful, 
That if you spend too much time 
caught up in yourself
You just might miss Him that is goddess, 
she that is god, 
they that are legends
Working the runway as if walking on water 
Reaching the stage to that promised land
where ‘peace’ is not ridiculed and the only war worth fighting for
is protecting your child from the terrorist acts of a mainstream America
where ‘reading’ is an act of learning 
not degrading words used to disguise 
fragility and fractured dreams
where ‘shade’ is a shadow you walk in 
to avoid the light
but who wants to stay 
out of the warmth of the sun? 
If you waste your time 
trying to be a false prophet 
robed in attitude and labels 
to obscure the insecurity
you may fail to recognize 
their divinity and miracles
parting the crowds, resurrecting from the floor, 
scoring tens of commandments, 
because trophies will not feed the hungry, 
coat the homeless, 
hide the scars, 
Grand Prizes will not bring Lazarus or LaBeija back from the dead
they will just sit in your closet, 
fake idols gathering dust, 
before the gold paint chips away
You cannot sell them for freedom
You cannot trade them in for love
There are Gods amongst us in these ghettos
so black, so fierce, 
so black, so beautiful, 
so brown, so fierce, 
so brown, so beautiful, 
Watch them carefully and say your prayers 
as they enter the ballroom
angel wing feathers decorating skin 
recrafted over silicone 
and martyred colors
See the Gods dream, see the Gods give, 
see the Gods live, 
They exist in the spaces where white 
is not the only hue 
that represents purity
They will not battle to your rhythms and beats
click, spin and dip simply for amusement
They will not teach those who share their souls and names to hate
Their heartbeats are louder 
than the blaring speakers 
You want realness... look at your hands
are they red from the revolution or from the blood of your own sisters
There are Gods amongst us in these ghettos
so black, so brown, so fierce, 
so beautiful, so bright
Look up towards the heavens and pray
then look at yourself in the mirror and say
‘Stars are not only found out in the sky 
but in ourselves’

Step Father,"He forgets that he used to call me mariconcito-
that I harbored years of hatred toward him
while hoping to find my real father. My
childhood memories of him reminding me
I was my mother’s son, not his. I tried
to poison him once and scattered sharp nails
inside the shoes in his closet. By the time one
of his sons died of AIDS I was already lost
in contempt for the man I blamed for everything.
There was the time I was in love and he met my 
boyfriends. Now he forgets to go to the bathroom
or where he is. I help him walk slowly
outdoors to step outside the prison cell that is
the tiny apartment with no windows in which
I grew up abused by both of them. He barely
understands. His fate has been torture. I know
that I cannot be his savior. I used to pray for
him to die but here he is slowly fading. In his
eyes I see that he learned to love me and wishes
he could take it all back. He is unable to recall
those drunken nights and hateful words. I should
do the same. I left a long time ago but he still
remains haunted by the little boy who wanted
to belong. Like him, I want to forget that we
made mistakes and caused so much pain. I need
for both of us to remember how he taught me
how to ride a bike and how to swim and told
me, better late than never, that he loved me and
was proud of all I had done. I have to help him
settle into his favorite chair and let him know that
I forgive him. There is a place somewhere where
he will call me hijo and I will know him as my dad.
    Paso Padre
Se olvida que me llamaba mariconcito— 
que albergué años de odio hacia él
mientras esperaba encontrar a mi verdadero padre. 
Memorias de la infancia, 
él recordándome que era hijo de mi madre, no de él. 
Una vez intenté envenarlo y puse uñas afiladas 
dentro de los zapatos en su armario. 
Cuando uno de sus hijos murió de sida yo ya estaba perdido 
en el desprecio por el hombre al que culpé de todo.
Hubo un tiempo en que estuve enamorado y conoció a mis novios. 
Ahora se olvida de ir al baño o donde está. 
Le ayudo a salir afuera, a caminar despacio, 
a que salga de la prisión que es el pequeño apartamento 
sin ventanas dónde crecí abusado por los ambos.  
El apenas entiende. Su destino ha sido una tortura. 
Sé          que no puedo ser su salvador. 
Solía orar para que muriera, 
pero aquí se está desvaneciendo lentamente. 
En sus ojos veo que aprendió a quererme 
y que desea poder recuperarlo todo.  
Es incapaz de recordar esas noches de borrachera 
y palabras llenas de odio.
Yo debería hacer lo mismo. 
Me fui hace mucho tiempo, 
pero todavía  lo atormenta el niño que quería pertenecer.
Como él, quiero olvidar que cometimos errores
causamos tanto dolor. 
Necesito que ambos recordemos 
como me enseñó a andar en bicicleta 
y cómo nadar y me dijo mejor tarde que nunca que me amaba 
y que estaba orgulloso de todo lo que yo había hecho. 
Tengo que acomodarlo en su silla favorita 
y dejarle saber que lo perdono. 
Hay un lugar donde me llamará hijo 
y lo conoceré como mi papá.

Après le Feu,"I am safe in our home with my husband, living the life—
all new appliances. There’s that clip from Paris Is Burning 
when Venus Xtravaganza equates prostitution to what 
women in the suburbs do to get a washer and dryer. I 
was not trans like her or Anji but we did what we had to do 
to make our coins. I get to still be here today, too old to hustle, 
shoplift or risk getting killed. The only mopping I do these 
days is occasionally on the kitchen floor. In those days, 
everyone was afraid of dying of AIDS or simply dying. We 
belonged to Houses because most of us were homeless. Our 
fathers abandoned us because they already had families and 
our mothers cast us out as demons or something similar. We 
all had stories, many forgotten. Our parents were never wrong.
It was our fault if we came home bloodied from school or 
found dead in a cheap hotel room. No one felt bad for us—
the family, the cops, the government. We deserved it. That’s all.
But now children can choose their gender, be celebrated for 
coming out, live in fluidity. I survived at the expense of my sisters
being sacrificed. I remember the chicken hawks we fought off, 
the closet cases “On the DL!,” dark alleys, married men with 
wives at home cooking dinner, being a dirty little secret. And
now I only worry about paying Con Edison, ordering DoorDash, 
Amazon deliveries. We were criminals, prostitutes, destined for 
prison or hell. Now I Google my dead friends to see what is said
about them, make reservations to go out for “ouchie” dinners, 
plan our next vacations. I pay tribute with poems I read to high 
school students, inmates, nostalgic Nuyoricans. New generations
get crowned and walk away with Anastasia Beverly Hills cosmetics 
for being the best at what our girls were once eliminated for. If 
they were alive today, would they be celebrated? Or murdered in a 
world that’s still violent towards queer and trans people. There are 
essays and articles about how we lived. I tell my spouse stories as 
we dine somewhere safe and welcoming. I sleep like the child I 
never really got to be, dream for all our angels who never had this 
moment.

T4T,"There is no known root for how the word cum
came to mean what it does. But imagine
if you could stitch a lineage back to the Latin
cum meaning to step. Hence: movement.
Hence: a destination. The body moving,
perhaps dancing, toward a kind of end.
Vanishing point of flesh—trembling tongue
-fucked apocalyptic. Apocalypsis. A veil
shifted & what awaits beneath. A rose
by any other given name could still
draw blood if it wanted. But shit, turns out
there’s no emoji for a rubber dick

still feel it twitch. Hold you in my mouth
spit slick apocrypha. Sweet faggot magic

Christian names—lick cock to clit, bruise
breast to flattened chest, bury knuckles inside
a redrafted anatomy. Sucked finger shudder. Lust

wind when moving. Holy, how you fuck me

Latinx Is,"something between Latino and Latina, reclaiming how we are defined
hombres sitting in front of lit mirrors with a table full of cosmetics & mujeres
with skin fades and ACE-bandaged-down breasts. Something like drag queens
at La Escuelita and butches at Café con Leche, like your cool tio that teaches 
you how to death drop and titi with a mustache. Something like your primo
that mysteriously disappeared from the family and is never spoken about. 
Somewhere between “When did you come into this country?” & brown babies
in hospital delivery rooms. Growing up in a country where we are told to go back 
to wherever we came from. Somewhere between being oppressed by white-washed 
politicians that come from families that look like us & our bodies outlined with white 
chalk on sidewalks when we are killed. Checked boxes without nuance. Something 
between J-Lo & Jenny from the block, Rita Hayworth & Rita Moreno, migrating across 
rivers & spending all your money on airfare. Something between VapoRub & brujeria. 
Appreciating art by Goya & Trump-loving Goya products from Spain. Taco Tuesdays 
& the waitstaff and cooks at Italian restaurants, children in cages & kids bussed to
schools where they are called “Spics!” Teens turning to gangs for brotherhood/
sisterhood & in the hood, maricones getting gay-bashed. Alcoholism & Corona, tequila, margaritas, mezcal. Somewhere between a quinceañera and a Sweet Sixteen.

Celebrating Cinco de Mayo & clutching your purse as brown boys walk by. Fetishizing Latin lovers & sex-trafficking girls who speak Spanish. Getting displaced by gentrification & “They’re taking over our neighborhoods!” Somewhere between
desirable & Undesirable. Being unwanted no matter what letter closes us out—an o, an a, an x, an e.
Somewhere between Vanna White and “Wanna buy a vowel?” Somewhere between
“Your English is so good!” and speaking Spanglish. Somewhere between the right to live
the American dream & being a “welfare queen!” Somewhere between “Gracias to the

Academy!” & filling up our prisons. Somewhere between “¡El pueblo, unido, jamás
será vencido!” and “We’re Here! We’re Queer! Get used to it!” Somewhere between Dia
de los Muertos & painting your face white to symbolize death. Somewhere between “You

have the right to remain silent!” and “Silence equals death.” Somewhere between
telenovelas and the new One Day at a Time. Somewhere between Richie Valens & Cardi
B. Gender fluid like Walter Mercado and Demi Lovato. Somewhere between
Lady

land first and x marks the damn spot!

girl after girl after giving herself to herself

i learn this best from the snake angulating 
out of her pork-rind dress. i crawl out of myself

once, i snatched my heart out like a track 
& found not a heart, but two girls forever 
playing slide on a porch in my chest.
who knows how they keep count
they could be a single girl doubled 
& joined at the hands. i’m stalling.
i want to say something without saying it 
but there’s no time. i’m waiting for a few folks 
i love dearly to die so i can be myself.
please don’t make me say who.

The Glassy Harbor,"O faint sad noises

rose-colored blindness

those who walk near
the glassy harbor.
Silent drift of deserters

receding, receding . . .
nothing to hold onto

Go Youth,"I was in a dreamstate and this was causing a problem
with the traffic. I felt lonely, like I’d missed the boat,
or I’d found the boat and it was deserted. In the middle
of the road a child’s shoe glistened. I walked around it.
It woke me up a little. The child had disappeared. Some
mysteries are better left alone. Others are dreary, distasteful,
and can disarrange a shadow into a thing of unspeakable beauty.

The Ice Cream Man,"I answered the ad in the paper. I had been unemployed for
nine months and was desperate. At the interview, the man said,
“Do you have much experience climbing tall mountains?” “Absolutely.
I climb them all the time. If I see a tall mountain, I have to
climb it immediately,” I said. “What about swimming long distances
in rough ocean waters, perhaps in a storm?” he said. “I’m like
a fish, you can’t stop me. I just keep going in all kinds of
weather,” I said. “Could you fly a glider at night and land in
a wheat field, possibly under enemy fire?” he said. “Nothing
could come more naturally to me,” I said. “How are you with
explosives? Would a large building, say, twenty stories high
present you with much difficulty?” he said. “Certainly not. I
pride myself on a certain expertise,” I said. “And I take it you
are fully acquainted with the latest in rocket launchers and land-
mines?” he said. “I even own a few myself for personal use. They’re
definitely no problem for me,” I said. “Now, Mr. Strafford, or may
I call you Stephen, what you’ll be doing is driving one of our ice
cream trucks, selling ice cream to all the little kids in the
neighborhood, but sometimes things get tricky and we like all our
drivers to be well-trained and well-equipped to face any eventu-
ality, you know, some fathers can get quite irate if you are out
of their kid’s favorite flavor or if the kid drops the cone,” he
said. “I understand, I won’t hesitate to take appropriate action,”
I said. “And there are certain neighborhoods where you’re under
advisement to expect the worst, sneak attacks, gang tactics,
bodies dropping from trees or rising out of manholes, blockades,
machine gun fire, launched explosives, flamethrowers and that kind
of thing. You can still do a little business there if you are on
your toes. Do you see what I’m saying?” he said. “No problem. I
know those kinds of neighborhoods, but, as you say, kids still want
their ice cream and I won’t let them down,” I said. “Good, Stephen,
I think you’re going to like this job. It’s exciting and challenging.
We’ve, of course, lost a few drivers over the years, but mostly it
was because they weren’t paying attention. It’s what I call the Santa
Claus complex. They thought they were there just to make the kids
happy. But there’s a lot more to it than that. One of our best
drivers had to level half the city once. Of course, that was an
extreme case, but he did what needed to be done. We’ll count on you
to be able to make that kind of decision. You’ll have to have all
your weapons loaded and ready to go in a moment’s notice. You’ll
have your escape plans with you at all times,” he said. “Yes, sir,
I’ll be ready at all times,” I said. “And, as you know, some of
the ice cream is lethal, so that will require a quick judgment call
on your part as well. Mistakes will inevitably be made, but try
to keep them at a minimum, otherwise the front office becomes
flooded with paperwork,” he said. “I can assure you I will use it
only when I deem it absolutely necessary,” I said. “Well, Stephen,
I look forward to your joining our team. They’re mostly crack
professionals, ex–Green Berets and Navy Seals and that kind of
thing. At the end of the day you’ve made all those kids happy,
but you’ve also thinned out the bad seeds and made our city a
safer place to be,” he said. He sat there smiling with immense
pride. “How will I know which flavor is lethal?” I said. “Experiment,”
he said. I looked stunned, then we both started laughing.","Stephen Strafford had been unemployed for nine months. He answered an ad in the paper for an ice cream truck driver. The man said, ""I think you’re going to like this job"""

Funeral for Unreturned Ashes,sent regrets by smoke // dull coatings of a time // now ambered // into its search for // a former light // when the world was not dark // just lightless // except for those flashpoints of skin // little currents that mark // the only things // we ever shared // to know we both craved // in the same brilliant age // a desire with gravity // the seedy impact of two bodies // who collide by choice // even at the cost of systems // still breaking // wills and testaments // that keep what remains // of you abroad // in a home you tried to make // but never bedded // until this restless sleep,The song is a tribute to a time when the world was not dark and lightless except for those flashpoints of skin. The song is about two bodies who collide by choice and the seedy impact of two bodies.
Corsair,"Remember, every lover is a corsair seeking glory,
An x-marks-the-spot, a longing for invisible treasure,
Every lover is an end-point and a start-point
In the history of the world, a spark in the bright flare
Of the possible. Our swashbuckling lovers remind us:
Once we were lazing children,
Housebound and shoreless,
With no concept of the sea,
But now there’s the ocean’s blue spool,
Fleet-winged gulls, windblown caravels,
Even spouting whales,
Crow’s nests, and clouds like a white armada—
And so, when we relinquish the body’s treasure map, our lovers
Discover us the way the sailcloth in the rigging
Fills with the trade winds, from the last of the night’s stars
Through the lavish tangerine of dawn, our ships
Gliding over sheets of light-glazed silver.","Every lover is an end-point and a start-point, a spark in the history of the world. Remember, every lover is a corsair seeking glory, seeking glory."
The Voyage,"Exile begins now
among these clouds.
You can’t feel it yet
but the premonition wanders through the corridors
and makes silence pollute the air.
Here is the border between what you were
and the new dreams
that you will weave to save yourself.
Here also
the limits of the body
the symmetry of fatigue
the beginning of invisible lives
that follow one another simultaneously
on the planet of what would have been.
The past is kept in bubbles
where time does not pass
until your return
but if you don’t return
it is eradicated.
You won’t think of extinguishing
you will never again name the tragedy
the banishment
will hang from your eyelashes
like a permanent fruit
and you will bite from it
when the poison
begins to make tumors
in your mind.
    El viaje
El exilio comienza ahora
entre estas nubes.
No puedes sentirlo aún
pero el presentimiento se pasea por los pasillos
y hace que el silencio contamine el aire.
Aquí está la frontera entre lo que eras
y los nuevos sueños
que tejerás para salvarte.
Aquí también
los límites del cuerpo
la simetría del cansancio
el inicio de las vidas invisibles
que se suceden simultáneamente
en el planeta del qué habría sido.
El pasado se guarda en burbujas
donde el tiempo no pasa
hasta tu regreso
pero si no regresas
se extingue.
No pensarás en apagarte
no volverás a nombrar la tragedia
el destierro
colgará de tus pestañas
como fruta permanente
y morderás de él
cuando el veneno
empiece a hacer tumores
en tu mente.",Exile begins now among these clouds. You can’t feel it yet. But the premonition wanders through the corridors. And makes silence pollute the air.

Nostalgia,"The worst part of it is that I’ve forgotten your face. Or the idea that each tide was a slender finger pulling at these knots, loose end then left to work on another day. Lost at sea, love is a logogram: less than, fewer still, a word made nothing more than cauter-mark on starboard hard, port I left all those years ago. Sometimes, I dream of my own (sorry, our own) great-rooted bed, shaped from something still alive. Eurycleia means “broad fame” and that’s a sandy-pit, if you ask me. It’s an island beautiful as a scarred oxen’s back, sowed with lash and eyes. I saw something of you the other day in this glass of magic, vase filled with smoke’s children. There’s that dress you wore, I said to no one in particular. There’s that blue that never bled to red wine, dark in its never-nocked-arrow waves. And suddenly you’re the moon, again, lost in reflection’s sea. I follow the light to nowhere as I wander through the sipped sleeve. Because. Because you walked the stairs that night before I left, after we heard the rain spill like grain from a split sack. You walked in front of me, just above the cochineal stars, bright bald ember, fashioned still spear. I think of nothing else but you. It’s true. It’s the worst part of forgetting, all this remembering.","Eurycleia means “broad fame’ and that’s a sandy-pit, if you ask me.

"East of Wyoming, I Remember Matthew Shepard","After The Entombment by Raphael
The night my father died, I sat on a stool 
          at the Buckhorn, gazing
                     out the window’s cool counter seat. 
Like a funhouse mirror, you appeared. 
          I have a familiar-looking face; my father used to say—
                     his wish for me to blend in. 
Late after an argument, I fled 
          and was found bound to a prairie fence 
                     after eighteen hours.
My body is like a sock in the wind 
          in a field just a mile from here. 
                     My face blooms, velvety 
and light like a lamb’s ear, 
          stachys byzantina; my ears 
                     frozen with blood; down 
my neck, it goes. A medley of ants shuffles 
          away. My body is rich with the sour smell 
                     of urine on my head like a crown of daffodils. ","After The Entombment by Raphael is published by Simon & Schuster. The book is about the death of Raphael's father, who was found bound to a prairie fence."
The Mountains,"There is snow, now—
A thing of silent creeping—
And day is strange half-night . . .
And the mountains have gone, softly murmuring something . . .
And I remember pale days, 
Pale as the half-night . . . and as strange and sad.
I remember times in this room
When but to glance thru an opened window
Was to be filled with an ageless crying wonder:
The grand slope of the meadows,
The green rising of the hills,
And then far-away slumbering mountains—
Dark, fearful, old—
Older than old, rusted, crumbling rock,
Those mountains . . .
But sometimes came a strange thing
And theirs was the youth of a cloudlet flying,
Sunwise, flashing . . .
                  And such is the wisdom of the mountains!
                  Knowing it nothing to be old,
                  And nothing to be young!
There is snow, now—
A silent creeping . . .
And I have walked into the mountains,
Into canyons that gave back my laughter,
And the lover-girl’s laughter . . .
And at dark,
When our skin twinged to the night-wind,
Built us a great marvelous fire
And sat in quiet,
Carefully sipping at scorching coffee . . .
But when a coyote gave to the night
A wail of all the bleeding sorrow,
All the dismal, grey-eyed pain
That those slumbering mountains had ever known—
Crept close to each other
And close to the fire—
Listening—
Then hastily doused the fire
And fled (giving many excuses)
With tightly-clasping hands.
Snow, snow, snow—
A thing of silent creeping
And once,
On a night of screaming chill,
I went to climb a mountain’s cold, cold body
With a boy whose eyes had the ancient look of the mountains,
And whose heart the swinging dance of a laughter-child . . .
Our thighs ached
And lungs were fired with frost and heaving breath—
The long, long slope—
A wind mad and raging . . .
Then—the top!
                  There should have been . . . something . . .
                  But there was silence, only—
                  Quiet after the wind’s frenzy,
                  Quiet after all frenzy—
                  And more mountains,
                  Endlessly into the night . . .
                  And such is the wisdom of mountains!
                  Knowing how great is silence,
                  How nothing is greater than silence!
And so they are gone, now,
And they murmured something as they went—
Something in the strange half-night . . .","I remember pale days,  pale as the half-night . . . and as strange and sad. There is snow, now, a thing of silent creeping. And the mountains have gone, softly murmuring something."
Dream On,"Some people go their whole lives
without ever writing a single poem.
Extraordinary people who don’t hesitate
to cut somebody’s heart or skull open.
They go to baseball games with the greatest of ease
and play a few rounds of golf as if it were nothing.
These same people stroll into a church
as if that were a natural part of life.
Investing money is second nature to them.
They contribute to political campaigns
that have absolutely no poetry in them
and promise none for the future.
They sit around the dinner table at night
and pretend as though nothing is missing.
Their children get caught shoplifting at the mall
and no one admits that it is poetry they are missing.
The family dog howls all night,
lonely and starving for more poetry in his life.
Why is it so difficult for them to see
that, without poetry, their lives are effluvial.
Sure, they have their banquets, their celebrations,
croquet, fox hunts, their seashores and sunsets,
their cocktails on the balcony, dog races,
and all that kissing and hugging, and don’t
forget the good deeds, the charity work,
nursing the baby squirrels all through the night,
filling the birdfeeders all winter,
helping the stranger change her tire.
Still, there’s that disagreeable exhalation
from decaying matter, subtle but ever present.
They walk around erect like champions.
They are smooth-spoken, urbane and witty.
When alone, rare occasion, they stare
into the mirror for hours, bewildered.
There was something they meant to say, but didn’t:
“And if we put the statue of the rhinoceros
next to the tweezers, and walk around the room three times,
learn to yodel, shave our heads, call
our ancestors back from the dead—”
poetrywise it’s still a bust, bankrupt.
You haven't scribbled a syllable of it.
You're a nowhere man misfiring
the very essence of your life, flustering
nothing from nothing and back again.
The hereafter may not last all that long.
Radiant childhood sweetheart,
secret code of everlasting joy and sorrow,
fanciful pen strokes beneath the eyelids:
all clay, all night meditation, knot of hope,
kernel of desire, pure ordinariness of life,
seeking, through poetry, a benediction
or a bed to lie down on, to connect, reveal,
explore, to imbue meaning on the day's extravagant labor.
And yet it’s cruel to expect too much.
It’s a rare species of bird
that refuses to be categorized,
Its song is barely audible.
It is like a dragonfly in a dream—
here, then there, then here again,
low-flying amber-wing darting upward
and then out of sight.
And the dream has a pain in its heart
the wonders of which are manifold,
or so the story is told.","Some people go their whole lives                without ever writing a single poem. They sit around the dinner table at night and pretend as though nothing is missing. The family dog howls all night, lonelyly and starving for more poetry in his life."
The Cowboy,"    Someone had spread an elaborate rumor about me, that I was
in possession of an extraterrestrial being, and I thought I knew who
it was. It was Roger Lawson. Roger was a practical joker of the
worst sort, and up till now I had not been one of his victims, so
I kind of knew my time had come. People parked in front of my
house for hours and took pictures. I had to draw all my blinds
and only went out when I had to. Then there was a barrage of
questions. “What does he look like?” “What do you feed him?” “How
did you capture him?” And I simple denied the presence of an
extraterrestrial in my house. And, of course, this excited them
all the more. The press showed up and started creeping around
my yard. It got to be very irritating. More and more came and
parked up and down the street. Roger was working overtime
on this one. I had to do something. Finally, I made an announcement.
I said, “The little fellow died peacefully in his sleep at 11:02
last night.” “Let us see the body,” they clamored. “He went up
in smoke instantly,” I said. “I don’t believe you,” one of them
said. “There is no body in the house or I would have buried it
myself,” I said. About half of them got in their cars and drove
off. The rest of them kept their vigil, but more solemnly now.
I went out and bought some groceries. When I came back about an
hour later another half of them had gone. When I went into the kitchen
I nearly dropped the groceries. There was a nearly transparent
fellow with large pink eyes standing about three feet tall. “Why
did you tell them I was dead? That was a lie,” he said. “You
speak English,” I said. “I listen to the radio. It wasn’t very
hard to learn. Also we have television. We get all your channels.
I like cowboys, especially John Ford movies. They’re the best,”
he said. “What am I going to do with you?” I said. “Take me
to meet a real cowboy. That would make me happy,” he said. “I
 don’t know any real cowboys, but maybe we could find one. But
people will go crazy if they see you. We’d have press following
us everywhere. It would be the story of a century,” I said.
“I can be invisible. It’s not hard for me to do,” he said.
“I’ll think about it. Wyoming or Montana would be our best bet, but
they’re a long way from here,” I said. “Please, I won’t cause
you any trouble,” he said. “It would take some planning,” I said.
I put the groceries down and started putting them away. I tried
not to think of the cosmic meaning of all this. Instead, I
treated him like a smart little kid. “Do you have any sarsaparilla?”
he said. “No, but I have some orange juice. It’s good for you,”
I said. He drank it and made a face. “I’m going to get the maps
out,” I said. “We’ll see how we could get there.” When I came
back he was dancing on the kitchen table, a sort of ballet, but
very sad. “I have the maps,” I said. “We won’t need them. I just
received word. I’m going to die tonight. It’s really a joyous
occasion, and I hope you’ll help me celebrate by watching The
Magnificent Seven,” he said. I stood there with the maps in my
hand. I felt an unbearable sadness come over me. “Why must
you die?” I said. “Father decides these things. It is probably
my reward for coming here safely and meeting you,” he said. “But
I was going to take you to meet a real cowboy,” I said. “Let’s
pretend you are my cowboy,” he said.","Someone had spread an elaborate rumor about me, that I was in possession of an extraterrestrial being.

Goodtime Jesus,"Jesus got up one day a little later than usual. He had been dreaming so deep there was nothing left in his head. What was it? A nightmare, dead bodies walking all around him, eyes rolled back, skin falling off. But he wasn’t afraid of that. It was a beautiful day. How ’bout some coffee? Don’t mind if I do. Take a little ride on my donkey, I love that donkey. Hell, I love everybody.","Jesus had been dreaming so deep there was nothing left in his head. He wasn't afraid of that. It was a beautiful day.

To the Miscodeed,"Sweet pink of northern wood and glen,
E’er first to greet the eyes of men
In early spring,—a tender flower
Whilst still the wintry wind hath power.
How welcome, in the sunny glade,
Or hazel copse, thy pretty head
Oft peeping out whilst still the snow,
Doth here and there, its presence show
Soon leaf and bud quick opening spread
Thy modest petals—white with red
Like some sweet cherub—love’s kind link,
With dress of white, adorned with pink",The flower is first to greet the eyes of men in early spring. It is white with red petals and is adorned with pink petals.
The Last Orgasm,"Stars and people and daffodils won’t last forever.
Hands down, forever will succumb to a single sensation,
one last heaven, one last shudder     
lost voice carried over the winds of the body, the canyons
of the hands in a shower, snow or warm? Last ashes
of satisfaction dance above an open mouth, teeth like light
in an emptied room, the wet music of the tongue.
Somebody will find the edge to all of humanity’s joy, a flood,
a punctuation will flood her with its certainty,
or them, or us, all at once, and that lonely breach
will ripple through, on and out, with indefatigable atoms.
Those asking hands never to slow their speeding ship     
one last starry daffodil excess will blow its soft dunes,
that lost voice, back, over everything that ever came
before. Until emptied out. And if you slow, if you slowly reach
across your own body until you feel it, too, even now?
You can come to an end, even now. It lasts, wanting to.","One last heaven, one last shudder, a lost voice carried over the winds of the body, the canyons of the hands in a shower, snow or warm. Last ashes of satisfaction dance above an open mouth, teeth like light in an emptied room."
Bicuspid,"Of course the moment your parents mentally divorce
a baby gap appears between your two front teeth.
Then not before long your four canines follow suit
the way a pack of puppies might follow a child home
one afternoon—the half-eaten lunch in their book sack
crushed to unleash the mutt version of myrrh.
Finally, your molars & premolars no longer thirst
to slumber on the same cot, so branch off to sofas,
the floor, even wising up to comfort themselves in dirt.
So your poor parents, to save your gums from
hardening the way plaque steels the arteries, grief,
the heart, your parents are forced to break the bank
on turquoise braces for however many years it takes for
your smile to straighten itself out like the curve
of a swing when the sky plops down. They must
split the payments until your sore mouth no longer
doubts its separation. Your tastebuds chained beneath
and behind the fence your parents went Dutch
on like their first dates. The masseter carrying all
the bells & more whistle than master. & your tongue
in its lunacy pawing at every ivory picket for its escape.",When you're a baby a gap appears between your two front teeth. Not before long your four canines follow suit. Your parents are forced to break the bank on turquoise braces for years.

Leaving Childhood Behind,"When I left, I left my childhood in the drawer
and on the kitchen table. I left my toy horse
in its plastic bag. 
I left without looking at the clock. 
I forget whether it was noon or evening. 

Our horse spent the night alone, 
no water, no grains for dinner. 
It must have thought we’d left to cook a meal 
for late guests or to make a cake
for my sister’s tenth birthday. 

I walked with my sister, down our road with no end. 
We sang a birthday song. 
The warplanes echoed across the heavens. 
My tired parents walked behind, 
my father clutching to his chest
the keys to our house and to the stable. 

We arrived at a rescue station. 
News of the airstrikes roared on the radio. 
I hated death, but I hated life, too, 
when we had to walk to our drawn-out death, 
reciting our never-ending ode. ","When I left, I left my childhood in the drawer and on the kitchen table. I left without looking at the clock,  forget whether it was noon or evening. I hated death, but I hated life, too,  when we had to walk to our drawn-out death."
Pacific Trash Vortex,"The blackened wooden Buddha on my desk
is missing fingers on a chipped left hand
that cups the air, pacific face in dusk

how liquid time might freeze in his robe’s form,
like folded icicles. But, no. The world
deliquesces and flows like sewage whirled
through pipes and frothing sewers and out storm
drains, gathering in the North Pacific Gyre
––plastic bags like jellyfish, ghost nets,
the small white finger bones of cigarettes,
and polymers and sludge and other mire
that is our legacy of floating loss,
nibbled by pelicans and albatross.

Worn,"He’s cleaning out the trunk in which his clothes 
are stored for summer, bathing suits, surf shorts, 
swimming goggles, neatly folded beach shirts,
all laundered, put in plastic, and then closed
away—and finds a black and silky bra, 
some short shorts with a tiny waist, a sleek 
black top, all empty of her, as is he, 
although she ghosts through him all night and gnaws
his dreams. They were so close he thought he wore 
her like a skin, as she wore him till they 
wore out. When doubt crawled in, she stored away 
her love and latched the trunk and left. It seems
he catches just a whiff of her somewhere
in the blouse. No, it’s clean. Too clean, too clean.

Moving Day,"He piles her boxes in the courtyard under
a tarp, the bookshelves, microwave, spare phone,
and though his friends make clear they wonder
why he would help her move, he says, “It’s fine.
I want to save her money, help her out.”
And he does—helps her move out, feeling weight
tear at his muscles. Now he is without
her things. They are inside the truck, her freight,
then on the freeway, then in her new flat,
then gone. He’s glad to ache in shoulder blades
and arms. It means that though she’s left him flat,
left him behind like old footprints, he’s made 
a choice as well, to move her, remove her,
a choice to move past, not be moved by her.

What Her Father Said,"After the barbeque the men stayed out
in the cold garden drinking sake, rum,
and whiskey, stomachs warm and fingers numb.
The yellow cat began to nose about
the chicken bones and cold asparagus,
leftover steak and daikon radish, salt
soy beans, cucumber salad. “It’s my fault,”
he said, “She doesn’t want me.” “Just give us
some time,” her father said—his gray hair tied back—
gripped his son-in-law’s hands across the table
and held them tight, tight. “Listen to me,”
he said, “In Japan, we say a dog is able
to eat all things, will even lick its ass.
But marriage trouble, even dogs won’t eat.”","After the barbeque the men stayed out in the cold garden drinking sake, rum, and whiskey. “It’s my fault,” he said, “She doesn’t want me.” “Just give us some time,’ her father said."
The Audit,"The time has come he never thought would come
when he sees her see in him just defects.
As if his heavy love has kept her down,
what once she thought was perfect she rejects.
She takes an audit of his qualities,
subtracts affection, multiplies distress,
and so, in sum, she takes his sum and sees
the countless reasons she should need him less.
She knows him better than he knows himself
so, if she finds his love to be oppression,
and reads all the good years as years of lies,
then he must turn his mind against himself
and see, laid out in infinite regression,
his net and gross of failure in her eyes.
 ","The time has come he never thought would come when he sees her see in him just defects. She takes an audit of his qualities,subtracts affection, multiplies distress. She knows him better than he knows himself."
Plans for the Future,"She watches as he signals to the waiter.
He doesn’t note how silent she is now,
he doesn’t catch her sadness, can’t see how
her eyes go dark and still as standing water.
Behind them in a fluid tangle, strange
ideas swim in black spirals, entwined
like eels. She watches how the subtle wind
tears at her husband’s hat. It isn’t strong
enough to toss it to the sky, but tugs
and grabs and shakes and doesn’t stop. Perhaps
a hurricane is needed. What she hopes:
a bomb will drop, all things will die but bugs,
the continent will slip into the sea,
the planet will implode, and she’ll be free.

Nightmare Kiss,"The middle of a kiss, and though he opened
up wide and wider, her own small jawbones gave
a little crack and stuck, and look what happened:
as if she’d fallen in an open grave,
he swallowed her at last, and then she wandered
in a dark saturated country where
the red land throbbed with capillaries under
electric stars. A kiss had brought her there,
a simple kiss that rained and filled her head
with blood, a nightmare kiss, a wrong man kiss;
why had she kissed a man with such a mouth,
with such thick teeth and jaws, such tongue, instead
of kissing someone who would let her out,
kissing someone nicer, who ate less.","A kiss had brought her there, a simple kiss that rained and filled her head with blood, a nightmare kiss, a wrong man kiss.

and no light to read by. ","In Gaza, the sun shines and the moon flirts with the leaves of the orange trees. We are fine, even though we don’t feel well."
Leaving Childhood Behind,"When I left, I left my childhood in the drawer
and on the kitchen table. I left my toy horse
in its plastic bag. 
I left without looking at the clock. 
I forget whether it was noon or evening. 

Our horse spent the night alone, 
no water, no grains for dinner. 
It must have thought we’d left to cook a meal 
for late guests or to make a cake
for my sister’s tenth birthday. 

I walked with my sister, down our road with no end. 
We sang a birthday song. 
The warplanes echoed across the heavens. 
My tired parents walked behind, 
my father clutching to his chest
the keys to our house and to the stable. 

We arrived at a rescue station. 
News of the airstrikes roared on the radio. 
I hated death, but I hated life, too, 
when we had to walk to our drawn-out death, 
reciting our never-ending ode. ","When I left, I left my childhood in the drawer and on the kitchen table. I left without looking at the clock,  forget whether it was noon or evening. I hated death, but I hated life, too,  when we had to walk to our drawn-out death."
Pacific Trash Vortex,"The blackened wooden Buddha on my desk
is missing fingers on a chipped left hand
that cups the air, pacific face in dusk
gazing at zero as if to understand
how liquid time might freeze in his robe’s form,
like folded icicles. But, no. The world
deliquesces and flows like sewage whirled
through pipes and frothing sewers and out storm
drains, gathering in the North Pacific Gyre
––plastic bags like jellyfish, ghost nets,
the small white finger bones of cigarettes,
and polymers and sludge and other mire
that is our legacy of floating loss,
nibbled by pelicans and albatross.

Worn,"He’s cleaning out the trunk in which his clothes 
are stored for summer, bathing suits, surf shorts, 
swimming goggles, neatly folded beach shirts,
all laundered, put in plastic, and then closed
away—and finds a black and silky bra, 
some short shorts with a tiny waist, a sleek 
black top, all empty of her, as is he, 
although she ghosts through him all night and gnaws
his dreams. They were so close he thought he wore 
her like a skin, as she wore him till they 
wore out. When doubt crawled in, she stored away 
her love and latched the trunk and left. It seems
he catches just a whiff of her somewhere
in the blouse. No, it’s clean. Too clean, too clean.

Moving Day,"He piles her boxes in the courtyard under
a tarp, the bookshelves, microwave, spare phone,
and though his friends make clear they wonder
why he would help her move, he says, “It’s fine.
I want to save her money, help her out.”
And he does—helps her move out, feeling weight
tear at his muscles. Now he is without
her things. They are inside the truck, her freight,
then on the freeway, then in her new flat,
then gone. He’s glad to ache in shoulder blades
and arms. It means that though she’s left him flat,
left him behind like old footprints, he’s made 
a choice as well, to move her, remove her,
a choice to move past, not be moved by her.

What Her Father Said,"After the barbeque the men stayed out
in the cold garden drinking sake, rum,
and whiskey, stomachs warm and fingers numb.
The yellow cat began to nose about
the chicken bones and cold asparagus,
leftover steak and daikon radish, salt
soy beans, cucumber salad. “It’s my fault,”
he said, “She doesn’t want me.” “Just give us
some time,” her father said—his gray hair tied back—
gripped his son-in-law’s hands across the table
and held them tight, tight. “Listen to me,”
he said, “In Japan, we say a dog is able
to eat all things, will even lick its ass.
But marriage trouble, even dogs won’t eat.”","After the barbeque the men stayed out in the cold garden drinking sake, rum, and whiskey. “It’s my fault,” he said, “She doesn’t want me.” “Just give us some time,’ her father said."
The Audit,"The time has come he never thought would come
when he sees her see in him just defects.
As if his heavy love has kept her down,
what once she thought was perfect she rejects.
She takes an audit of his qualities,
subtracts affection, multiplies distress,
and so, in sum, she takes his sum and sees
the countless reasons she should need him less.
She knows him better than he knows himself
so, if she finds his love to be oppression,
and reads all the good years as years of lies,
then he must turn his mind against himself
and see, laid out in infinite regression,
his net and gross of failure in her eyes.
 ","The time has come he never thought would come when he sees her see in him just defects. She takes an audit of his qualities,subtracts affection, multiplies distress. She knows him better than he knows himself."
Plans for the Future,"She watches as he signals to the waiter.
He doesn’t note how silent she is now,
he doesn’t catch her sadness, can’t see how
her eyes go dark and still as standing water.
Behind them in a fluid tangle, strange
ideas swim in black spirals, entwined
like eels. She watches how the subtle wind
tears at her husband’s hat. It isn’t strong
enough to toss it to the sky, but tugs
and grabs and shakes and doesn’t stop. Perhaps
a hurricane is needed. What she hopes:
a bomb will drop, all things will die but bugs,
the continent will slip into the sea,
the planet will implode, and she’ll be free.

Nightmare Kiss,"The middle of a kiss, and though he opened
up wide and wider, her own small jawbones gave
a little crack and stuck, and look what happened:
as if she’d fallen in an open grave,
he swallowed her at last, and then she wandered
in a dark saturated country where
the red land throbbed with capillaries under
electric stars. A kiss had brought her there,
a simple kiss that rained and filled her head
with blood, a nightmare kiss, a wrong man kiss;
why had she kissed a man with such a mouth,
with such thick teeth and jaws, such tongue, instead
of kissing someone who would let her out,
kissing someone nicer, who ate less.","A kiss had brought her there, a simple kiss that rained and filled her head with blood, a nightmare kiss, a wrong man kiss.

What is Home?,"What is home: 
it is the shade of trees on my way to school
    before they were uprooted.
It is my grandparents’ black-and-white wedding 
    photo before the walls crumbled. 
It is my uncle’s prayer rug, where dozens of ants
   slept on wintry nights, before it was looted and 
   put in a museum. 
It is the oven my mother used to bake bread and 
   roast chicken before a bomb reduced our house 
   to ashes. 
It is the café where I watched football matches
   and played—

Twin redheads fondle twin

The Night Before I Leave Home,"my brother gets out of bed at three, having lain down
only a few hours before, and pulls on his jeans, and stubs his toe
     on the doorjamb,
and cuts himself, just a scratch, reaching too fast in the dark
for wallet and keys—and the weapon? A bill, probably.
He goes out under the huge sky, out of the small house
and beyond, fields upon fields, where as children we played
     hide-and-seek and tag
and all those games, I miss them. All we imagined. In my
     brother’s mind
the fuzziness of the awakened-too-soon after not-enough-sleep
and the resentful calm that comes
when doing your duty to those you love,
to whom you could not
do otherwise.
He drives too fast, as always, braking hard when he
     finally arrives
at the meadow my car slid into before it slid
into an oak
where a whitetail hangs, strung
by its hind legs to drain the slit throat.
It takes more time than I expected
for death to be over,
I tell my brother. And he, a hunter, says, Yeah
in the tone that means, Of course.
And years later I have the same voice
when he calls at 4:17 a.m. and I knock the phone off the bed,
answering almost upside-down, stretched toward him.
His pain then, I lived for it, I realize now.
Not for its existence, but to quiet with my words.
I had left so long ago. I had left.
The doe’s eyeshine keeps us company. We joke
about our dead new friend. We share a half-drunk fifth
of Jim Beam tugged from under the passenger seat.
By the time the tow truck rumbles up, it’s well into dawn.
We are giddy—like children
who have played a game so wholly they have forgotten
the rules of the real world, and naturally
don’t want to remember. My brother turns to me near sunrise
to ask, What do you think he’s doing? Right now?
And I spin a story of a father
waking to polish his teeth, spit blood
into the eye of a porcelain bowl, wash a face like my brother’s.
That was a game, yes, us seeking the man
he was when not hurting us one and then the other,
and then the game ended
as children’s games do, when authority says
it’s time to disperse,
when the other gets on a plane, and one is left.","My brother gets out of bed at three, having lain down only a few hours before, and stubs his toe on the doorjamb.

Notes Toward an Elegy,"The Cypriot sun is impatient, a woman undressed

One day in the Old City, a pineapple rain.
And I’m on my way home from the pharmacy, carrying my
   little bag of cures.

Nihal brings espresso poured over ice, turns off the music.

Polished newels. Door askew in its frame.
Hot mornings. Hot apple tea, honeyed.

Whenever her hands dance, I tell her how beautiful.
She says there’s so much other movement I do not perceive.

I ask her to read to me. I like the way her voice handles words.
What will she read? First she laughs.
It’s a good day to laugh. The coffee is strong. And the light.
Why read when we can talk? When all our friends are here?
My perversity is silence, a shudder stopped
in the throat. When all the time I hear her voice:

The Specious Present,"I stared at the tiny xeroxed faces 
we wore like blurry jokes
pinned to our lapels.
Outside, the light raked the dry brown foothills 
we slid down on flattened cardboard boxes,
decades ago, out of control, fast,
fast as years. 
I still love the California hills,
I still love boxes and the way a word 
is a box. It holds things,
flotsam holding flotsam.

spilled on my bare feet as I danced
above the San Andreas Fault.
“Cathy,” they called me that night,

or a Nadia, unrecognizable save for the eyes 
and the animal drive to throw herself 
into a long line of aerial cartwheels, 
propelled forward and upside down 
past language into anachronistic light. ","The red wine warmed in my hands, it spilled on my bare feet as I dancedabove the San Andreas Fault.

A Marriage at Ancestral Hall in Sun Village,"She will never return home. In their first meeting, he asks to touch her skin. To touch or to feel. He asks her to climb a ladder so that he may see her legs, whether a pig can walk through them. I imagine once she begins climbing the ladder, she cannot stop. If the 1906 earthquake had fallen a day later, he would have set sail across the ocean four years earlier and the matchmaker would not have called her name. Think of the particular light cast across her skin as she lifts her sleeve for him, as she ascends the ladder, perhaps gathering the hem of her dress in one hand. This light will take her from her country. She will have seven children in California. When she receives word of her mother’s death, she will climb on the roof and let down her hair. Her hair was a kind of ladder, pinned and smoothed, you would never find it. We look upon the ocean so easily from this distance. She lifted her sleeve, she climbed the ladder of her hair every morning. The particular light against her skin. A different ocean moved through her—her blood in my blood with his blood.","In their first meeting, he asks to touch her skin. To touch or to feel.

What I Was Looking For,"were the unsent letters she’d left me years ago 
and which I hadn’t had the heart to read.
I’d found everything else. Or rather,
everything that could be found 
on paper, loose and bound, large, small,
smaller still, the size of fortunes fluttering to the floor
like moths, a message on each wing.
So many poems, by me but mostly others, 
some on slick paper I’d cut poorly from a page. 
My mother always said I was bad at scissors,
and I’ve often accidentally cut myself 
as if to prove her point. But now, both parents dead, 
it was time, I thought, I had the time and
courage, I thought, and I found the letters—
I was going to say, in the last place I looked, 
but of course, where else?—and when I read them
they were a marital memoir full of disappointments 
as familiar to me as my own
skin, and the bitter recriminations she was desperate 
to impart so that I might . . . avenge her? forgive her? 
I can’t say for sure. All I know is
I buried them both, in separate graves. I held their bodies
and most of their words and made my own from theirs.
I lay them down on this white field, another, another,
and another. If you look for us, look behind 
the letters, beneath the field to the blood.","The poet found letters his mother had left him years ago. The letters were a marital memoir full of disappointments and bitter recriminations. He buried them both, in separate graves."
A Vision of the End,"I once beheld the end of time!
   Its stream had ceased to be.
The drifting years, all soiled with crime,
   Lay in a filthy sea.
The prospect o’er the reeking waste
   Was plain from where I stood.
From shore to shore the wreckage faced
   The surface of the flood.
There all that men were wont to prize
   When time was flowing on,
Seemed here to sink and there to rise
   In formless ruin blown.
In slimy undulations roiled
   The glory of the brave;
The scholar’s fame, the rich man’s gold,
   Alike were on the wave.
There government, a monstrous form
   (The sea groaned ’neath the load),
A helpless mass blown by the storm,
   On grimy billows rode.
The bodies of great syndicates
   And corporations, trusts,
Proud combinations, and e’en states,
   All beasts of savage lusts,
With all the monsters ever bred
   In civilization’s womb,
Lay scattered, floating, dead,
   Throughout that liquid tomb.
It was the reign of general death,
   Wide as the sweep of eye,
Save two vile ghosts that still drew breath
   Because they could not die.
Ambition climbed above the waves
   From wreck to wreck he strove.
And as they sank to watery waves,
   He on to glory rode.
And there was Greed—immortal Greed—
   Just from the shores of time.
Of all hell’s hosts he took the lead,
   A monarch of the slime.
He neither sank below nor rose
   Above the brewing flood;
But swam full length, down to his nose,
   And steered where’er he would.
Whatever wreckage met his snout
   He swallowed promptly down—
Or floating empire, or redoubt,
   Or drifting heathen town.
And yet, it seemed in all that streaming waste
There nothing so much gratified his taste
As foetid oil in subterranean tanks,
And cliffs of coal untouched in nature’s banks,
Or bits of land where cities might be built,
As foraging plats for vileness and guilt;
Or fields of asphalt, soft as fluent salve
Or anything the Indian asked to have.
I once beheld the end of time!
   Its stream had run away;
The years all drifted down in slime,
   In filth dishonored lay.","I once beheld the end of time! The years all drifted down in slime, in filth dishonored lay. The glory of the brave, the rich man’s gold, were on the wave. Greed was the reign of general death, wide as the sweep of the eye, save two vile ghosts that still drew breath."

They sighed loudly as if inconvenienced.
We were patient. We knew our guests

time to adjust. For dinner, we prepared
turkey meatloaf with a side of cauliflower. 
This is too dry, they said.
This is not like what our mothers made. 
We wanted to offer a tour of our world, 
demonstrate how we freed ourselves 
from the prisons of linear time.
But the Earthlings were already spelunking 
our closets, prying tools 
from their containers and holding them 
to the light. What’s this? they demanded.

That’s a Quantum Annihilator; put that down.
That’s a Particle Grinder; please put that down.  
We could show you how to heal the sick, we said.
We could help you feed every nation, commune 
with the all-seeing sentient energy that palpitates 
through all known forms of matter.

Teach us to turn the moon into revenue!

unlocked. But walking by with a basket

by a thread, I think, of her perfume

not hang at the edge of her unmade bed.
No, the bed is made. The closet, half open,
is not quite empty. And not balled on the floor,
the tie-dyed T she so often wore to sleep.
When I catch myself in the floor length
mirror, I’m not as small as I imagined I’d be.
No, I don’t look different at all. I’ve lost
now, her scent, that curl of flower that must 
have slipped past me like a wraith,

Faith,"For centuries, an order of Japanese monks 
chose one of the elders to deliver prayers 
to the island of an important Bodhisattva. They set 
the elect adrift in a shrine shaped like a coffin 
with a month of salted fish, rice crackers & water 
while brothers on shore kept watch for signs of panic. 
In many cases, the sacrifice tried to row home 
but the others turned him, shoved him back 
into the sea. A mirror of human existence: 
each of us sent to beg forgiveness from whichever 
gods we recognize while death patiently paces 
the sky. As darkness swallows the world, imagine
the cry of gulls, glimpses of a distant horizon, 
the slow groan of the casket atop the waves. ","Japanese monks set the elect adrift in a shrine shaped like a coffin. The sacrifice tried to row home but the others turned him, shoved him back into the sea."

nearby truckers stare

long blond hair.

My Egypt,"Flaubert tells us he wore himself out

rattle interrupted by a gargle;
he wanted to take it back with him
And Kuchak’s bedbugs fascinated him,
their smell mingled with the scent
of her skin. I want, he told her,
a touch of bitterness in things.
Temples, sand dunes, the very Nile itself
made him lazy, and he wrote home:
“I think of nothing at all,
not even the elevated thoughts
one should have here
in the presence of ruins!”
He sent his letter, then went off
to visit Kuchuk of the long legs
again, wondering what she felt
any pleasure since “undoubtedly”
her button had been circumcised
when she was a child.
I who have traveled to Egypt confess
I saw another country. In Cairo
a man followed me and I had to run;
a student in a packed bus rubbed his crotch

The Twins Visit a Farm,"The heavy black bulk of the draft horse
lay in the heat, circled by lime. Too huge
to bury, it was left for flies, night animals.
We walked around the gleaming hill
of its flanks, the nostrils tulip-blue,
tiny terrain of the pink gums,
belly mushrooming sweetness.
Too timid to touch this mystery
we were old enough to know
this was his final
beauty, this laying out
on meadow grass, beside aspen.
That very afternoon we had chased the Holsteins
home, their full udders sloshing
warm milk on us as they ran,
their gentle lowing a quiet happiness.
Elderberries and wild raspberries
had caught at our skirts
as we trotted toward the old farmhouse
where Mrs. Chesrown was scrubbing the milk buckets
in the hot sudsy water and the final light.
Sun glinting on a black coat:
twilight closing over earth,
a time of evening that pinches.
I glanced across at my pigtailed twin
as we re-entered the gate of the farmyard.
She had grown this summer and her knees
looked knobbier, her legs, gangly.
Her face said: You too, you too.

A Great Beauty,"And when her son never returned
from the meant-to-crush-him camps,

the crucible of Poland,
always-hard-at-work Isa slept

for endless hours,
and once, under her lids, she was led,

by diligent female Virgils,
to a vast meadow

where an inspirited Isa embraced,
one by one,

countless women who remained
in mourning for their cherished sons.

Gallant and stricken,
together the myriad bereaved

but defiant women formed
an ever-widening circle,

prodigal with bitter tears,
and then, suddenly,

like a jackdaw darting
from eave to sun-drenched eave,

something flew between the throats
of the grieving,
heart-gutted mothers,
and a great beauty arose:

In the dream, Isa recalled,
the singing of the harrowed women

with war-taken sons
hushed the world’s barrenness.

Jasmine,"These are the days of jasmine in Rome
when headlong, emboldened April has dissolved,

and the joyous braiding of sun and rain
brings this sweet, steady broadcast;

when I step from the suppertime train,
that’s what greets me:

Roman hedges and walkways,
graffiti-laden precincts graced

with pallid fireworks, so even
the most tumbledown niches seem

breeze-swept,
festive now with fragrance

Jasmine    the elating moment’s shibboleth,
the cool, enrapturing night’s cavalry

Even crone-glorious Daria,
my terrace-loving neighbor, confides:

When Galliano came back from the front,
his right hand was bandaged,

but in his injured one,
ah, poet, he held

a fistful of jasmine he’d picked
along the path to my door.

untouchable,
quiet as it’s kept, I’ve carried it
into the shabbiest of cabins,
worn it as I witnessed

the hanging tree;
in dream-snatches
it blesses me, and I become
more than a brand,
a pretty chess piece:
at the mistress’s bell,
always prudent and afraid,
wily and afraid—
And when the day comes,

will become my daughter’s;

I swear,
she will never be shoeless

that we possessed
some quilt scrap of God.

kings of sugar, those implacable
princes of tobacco,

in our hardscrabble dreams,
sang it as sweat-drenched,
unshakable hallelujah,
whispered it as healing salve

stripes on our backs.

There, relegated to slave records

Hear silenced voices and lives

Consult the field.

Ask why does it lean? Let the whipping post tell it. 

It speaks in tongues of slash and deep gash.

Measure the distance between cabin and big house, 

but feel the canyon in between. 
See daytime and nighttime through cabin slats. 

Know cold and heat intimately. Hear bellies growl.
See chains or no chains but kept anyhow.

You might get a cook, a seamstress, a blacksmith, or a field hand. 

With a little luck and a little grace, you are blessed 
To find a relic to press to your dream memory upon. 

Conjure like a griot. Stir the pot. 
Keep it hot. 

Say enslaved not slave. What was done, 
was done unto us: shackle and chain.

Soul Make a Path Through Shouting,"for Elizabeth Eckford
Little Rock, Arkansas, 1957
Thick at the schoolgate are the ones
Rage has twisted
Into minotaurs, harpies
Relentlessly swift;
So you must walk past the pincers,
The swaying horns,
Sister, sister,
Straight through the gusts
Of fear and fury,
Straight through;
Where are you going? 
I’m just going to school.
Here we go to meet
The hydra-headed day,
Here we go to meet
The maelstrom -
Can my voice be an angel-on-the-spot,
An Amen corner?
Can my voice take you there,
Gallant girl with a notebook,
Up, up from the shadows of gallows trees
To the other shore:
A globe bathed in light,
A chalkboard blooming with equations -
I have never seen the likes of you,
Pioneer in dark glasses:
You won’t show the mob your eyes,
But I know your gaze,
Steady-on-the-North-Star, burning -
With their jerry-rigged faith,
Their spear of the American flag,
How could they dare to believe
You’re someone sacred?:
Nigger, burr-headed girl,
Where are you going?
I’m just going to school.

Speak of my people with pity, say, “Gone is their hour
Of dominion. By the strong wind of progress their power,
Like a rose past its brief time of blooming, lies shattered;
Like the leaves of the oak tree its people are scattered.”
This is the eighty-first autumn since I can remember.
Again fall the leaves, born in April and dead by December;
Riding the whimsied breeze, zigzagging and whirling,
Coming to earth at last and slowly upcurling,
Withered and sapless and brown, into discarded fragments,
Of what once was life; dry, chattering parchments
That crackle and rustle like old women’s laughter
When the merciless wind with swift feet coming after
Will drive them before him with unsparing lashes
’Til they are crumbled and crushed into forgotten ashes;
Crumbled and crushed, and piled deep in the gulches and hollows,
Soft bed for the yet softer snow that in winter fast follows
But when in the spring the light falling
Patter of raindrops persuading, insistently calling,
Wakens to life again forces that long months have slumbered,
There will come whispering movement, and green things unnumbered
Will pierce through the mould with their yellow-green, sun-searching fingers,
Fingers—or spear-tips, grown tall, will bud at another year’s breaking,
One day when the brooks, manumitted by sunshine, are making
Music like gold in the spring of some far generation. 
And up from the long-withered leaves, from the musty stagnation,
Life will climb high to the furthermost leaflets.
The bursting of catkins asunder with greed for the sunlight; the thirsting
Of twisted brown roots for earth-water; the gradual unfolding
Of brilliance and strength in the future, earth’s bosom is holding
Today in those scurrying leaves, soon to be crumpled and broken.
Let those who have ears hear my word and be still. I have spoken.","This is the eighty-first autumn since I can remember.

I love you. I miss you. Please get out of my house.,"Nothing today hasn’t happened before: 
I woke alone, bundled the old dog
into his early winter coat, watered him, 
fed him, left him to his cage for the day 
closing just now. My eye drifts 
to the buff belly of a hawk wheeling, 
as they do, in a late fall light that melts 
against the turning oak and smelts 
its leaves bronze. 
                             Before you left, 
I bent to my task, fixed in my mind
the slopes and planes of your face; 
fitted, in some essential geography,
your belly’s stretch and collapse 
against my own, your scent familiar 
as a thousand evenings. 
                                       Another time, 
I might have dismissed as hunger 
this cataloguing, this fitting, this fixing, 
but today I crest the hill, secure in the company 
of my longing. What binds us, stretches:
a tautness I’ve missed as a sapling, 
supple, misses the wind.","I woke alone, bundled the old dog into his early winter coat, watered him, fed him, left him to his cage for the day. My eye drifts                 to the buff belly of a hawk wheeling,                 as they do, in a late fall light that melts against the turning oak."
The Committee on Silence,"One morning when the sun erased all the night’s undoings, the villagers finally forgot how to close their eyes. They had grown tired of not seeing what all happened while they slept. They had grown tired of losing those fragile moments blinked away during each day’s dazzlement. That morning, no matter how hard the villagers tried, their eyelids would not budge. Even the softest fingers could not pinch closed any neighbor’s sight. They rejoiced. They would never miss the wolf approaching from the forest. They would never ignore the thief leaving the church with a sackful of eggs. They would never look past the child sticking chewed gum on a statue’s eye. They rejoiced and named the day Apollo Day. The Festival Committee was appointed. The Committee employed workers to saw down trees to be fashioned into spiral staircases leading far into the sky. The Committee hired labor to weave the surplus of exotic textiles into a quilt great enough to be cloaked around the entire village’s circumference. The Committee asked all the children to make with their hands a number of drawings to be nailed into each stair and stitched into every square of the fabric wall. When the moon next brightened its whole being, the festival was held. Music fled from mouths and instruments. Fire turned animals into food. Some people climbed into the night sky so far even eyes that could not close could not see them. Some people watched the wind move the wall like a single, continuous sheet of hymns. Some children hid and some children sought, but the children who were seeking always won. It was all anyone could speak of for the entire next year. The Committee decided on many agains. Festival after festival came and then went. After some time, the particulars gradually changed. Staircases were repaired, or replicas were made. The worn fabric was switched with nylon weave. Yet the children’s drawings remained largely the same. The elders saw in these sketches what they remembered seeing when they would blink. Instead of stories, each year’s festival ended with a sigh. The villagers continued their lives of light, speaking only of what they saw. The wolf approaching from the forest. The thief leaving the church with a sackful of eggs. The child sticking chewed gum on a statue’s eye. Sometimes what they saw they no longer wanted to see. A test was run, and village experts concluded everyone’s hearing had weakened. All signs pointed to it worsening. When someone spoke of a lake they once saw, the listener only heard a handful of silt. The experts decided there was nothing to be done. Year after year, the Committee continued to plan. One morning after the festival, when the sun lit the conquered dark, the villagers forgot how to open their ears. They had not planned for this. They named the day Harpocrates Day. No festival was to take place. They established the Committee on Silence. This brings us to the present day.",The villagers had grown tired of not seeing what all happened while they slept. They would never look past the child sticking chewed gum on a statue’s eye.
A Story about a Story about Death,"I am old. My grown daughter is helping me fall
asleep, telling me a story she once heard
as a little girl. My daughter is holding my hand
the way the ground holds a greedy shadow. The story
goes like this—a little girl’s father lived
to be a cottonwood. Every day, the girl read books
entangled in branches. Evenings, the moon
swam between leaves. Interrupting the story,
my grown daughter nods toward the dark
window. In it, a soft painting of a child
caring for a tree. That’s when I know
I’m asleep, pretending to be a white sheet
of paper. All around, June wind blows
the limbs’ whispers like familiar snow.","My grown daughter is helping me fall asleep, telling me a story she once heard as a little girl. The story goes like this—a little girl’s father lived                to be a cottonwood. Every day, the girl read books                entangled in branches."
Fairy Tale,"The student writes a word, copse, quickly
realizing if the poem were read aloud, the listener
might assume the word is cops and become confused
because why would that small child in the poem
walk straight into an unlit murder of cops looking
for the owl she had been hearing all night, the owl
who had kept her from sinking into the lake
of sleep she had so badly wanted? Because
the student is talented, the student understands
thicket would also suffice, but those syllables
disagree with the poem’s neighboring sibilants
and circular vowels, so the student begins to feel
the first light of uncaring, an unfamiliar feeling, knowing
copse is more true than thicket, knowing that sound
allows a more important logic than sense. But class
raises its concern after the poem is read aloud
because the class feels compelled to police
sense in a way the student wishes to forget since
the student suddenly feels like the small child
looking in the dark for the owl who kept her
far from sleep, the owl whose ring-shaped offerings
may only be described in the act of voicing.","The student writes a word, copse, quickly realizing if the poem were read aloud, the listener might assume the word is cops.

Meeting Mescalito at Oak Hill Cemetery,"Sixteen years old and crooked
with drug, time warped blissfully
as I sat alone on Oak Hill.
The cemetery stones were neither erect
nor stonelike, but looked soft and harmless;
thousands of them rippling the meadows
like overgrown daisies.
I picked apricots from the trees below
where the great peacocks roosted and nagged
loose the feathers from their tails.
I knelt to a lizard with my hands
on the earth, lifted him and held him
in my palm—Mescalito
was a true god.
Coming home that evening
nothing had changed. I covered Mama on the sofa
with a quilt I sewed myself, locked my bedroom
door against the stepfather, and gathered
the feathers I’d found that morning, each
green eye in a heaven of blue, a fistfull
of understanding; 
and late that night I tasted
the last of the sweet fruit, sucked the rich pit
and thought nothing of death.","The cemetery stones were neither erect nor stonelike, but looked soft and harmless. I picked apricots from the trees below where the great peacocks roosted and nagged the feathers from their tails. I knelt to a lizard with my hands, lifted him and held him in my palm."
Crow,"She started and shot from the pine,
then brilliantly settled in the west field
and sunned herself purple.
I saw myself: twig and rasp, dry
in breath and ammonia smelling.
Women taught me to clean
and then build my own house.
Before men came they whispered,
Know good polished oak. 
Learn hammer and Phillips.
Learn socket and rivet. I ran
over rocks and gravel they placed
by hand, leaving burly arguments
to fester the bedrooms. With my best jeans,
a twenty and a shepherd pup, I ran 
flushed and shadowed by no one
alone I settled stiff in mouth
with the words women gave me.","Women taught me to clean                and then build my own house. I ran                over rocks and gravel they placedby hand, leaving burly arguments                to fester the bedrooms. I settled stiff in mouth with the words women gave me."
Cannery Town in August,"All night it humps the air.
Speechless, the steam rises
from the cannery columns. I hear
the night bird rave about work
or lunch, or sing the swing shift
home. I listen, while bodyless
uniforms and spinach specked shoes
drift in monochrome down the dark
moon-possessed streets. Women
who smell of whiskey and tomatoes,  
peach fuzz reddening their lips and eyes—
I imagine them not speaking, dumbed
by the can’s clamor and drop
to the trucks that wait, grunting
in their headlights below.
They spotlight those who walk
like a dream, with no one
waiting in the shadows
to palm them back to living.","All night it humps the air. Women smell of whiskey and tomatoes,   peach fuzz reddening their lips and eyes. I imagine them not speaking, dumbed by the can’s clamor and drop to the trucks that wait, grunting below."
The Miracle of Giving,"Twice Christ took the bread apart
with his human hands that he used for
such tasks, once with fish and once with wine,
the grain a pattern of tribute, distribute,
as he worked the division of himself into
feeding others with his body, taken but not taken,
there but not there, it was two times
two times two. Ever body got some body
who will feed them even when there seem hardly
enough to go round. When I hungered the word
fed me. Even so, so many others hungered
he needed a hundred more human hands.
That was when I said here take mine.","Once Christ took the bread apart                with his human hands that he used for such tasks, once with fish and once with wine. Even so, so many others hungered                he needed a hundred more human hands. That was when I said here take mine."

Hoof,"—after Psalm 89, lines 26–35
Is it that I have had a richness 
of choices, have I gazelled 
sideways from one riverstone to the next?
         Or has this been a series 
         of false starts—
         the hoof withdrawn 
         at the slightest snow?

         into the night—marks 
their necessary kill. We all
need to eat

The Arid Land,"There will be willows plunging
Their bloodless roots in air
And the hard crooked flying
Of buzzards circled there.
About the treeless wastes
No sand may ever heap
With water, nothing will run
And nothing creep.

Under its iron band
Of sky, we yet may love
This so sunny land.","Arid, desolate, defiant, we yet may love. There will be willows plunging. Their bloodless roots in air. And the hard crooked flying                Of buzzards circled there."
Pinyan,"The plod of the trespassers
              on wet turf,
in the sinking dark,
              marked their path,
plan, toward the barn
              where it slept—
the stallion, resting
              from its thoroughbred
charge, hungry for oats,
              hay
-nested, silent
              save the hot breath
of its nostrils.
With night as protector,
              the men did steal
into the animal’s stall—
              craving its smell
and cozy parameter,

their shame and lustful

mythic tether to man,
              the centaur’s nobility

Perhaps, it was unbridled
              envy of nature
unbridled or the desire
              to be subdued raw
and primitively too,
              that led one—having
been broken
              early and practiced—
to seek consolation
              in this mating, of sorts:
the dumb and biological
              thrusts of the teased
phallus, the spewing
              and satisfaction,
all animal, really;
              the win-win grace
of it—the horse
              both horse and rider.","The stallion, resting from its thoroughbred charge, hungry for oats, is silent. The men did steal into the animal’s stall, craving its smell and cozy parameter, the better to bind their shame and lustful intention."
Offa’s Legacy,"Empire dwindled to tetrarchy, reliant, as an exotic concubine,

The sovereign silent and ceremonious, though powers rise
     at the choosing of the Garter, dazzles the opening

Muse,"So you’ve come back

to leave—walked me this far
through crowds to say that, here,

distance yourself,
throw this fiction of us on the pyre;
with a smirk on your face,
watch it burn—eyes in awe
as a patron of torture;
you, who would be most constant
when the caucuses of early hour
begin to bicker in the brain:
what word to hold you in place
beneath this captive’s power
or persuade a part of you
to concede itself to savior,
to haul this burden into some other life?","""You’ve come back to me, again, at last, to leave,"" he writes. ""You must turn a corner, distance yourself, and throw this fiction of us on the pyre,"" he adds."
Goliath,"When I asked Saul for a warrior, I had no idea it would be you.

as Ishbi-benob watched, my brother with his lack of judgment,
and all the others who haunt that space. I scorned you
after a week of battles, the steady beat of marching and shrill
ram’s horn in my ear. Since I could not chase, I scorned you.
Long has Orpah told tales of the sons of Israel, with flashing
eyes and a stealth no one can trace. I scorned you
because you made me weak in the presence of my troops,
reduced a great soldier to an old man’s pace. I scorned you
when you rattled me in the Valley of Elah. Even when the
stones began to fly, the enduring disgrace, I scorned you.","I underestimated your anger in the marketplace. I scorned you because you were beautiful and softer than the whores of Gath. When I asked Saul for a warrior, I had no idea it would be you. Even when you rattled me in the Valley of Elah."
Raising a Glass with an Arab Nationalist,"Translated from the Arabic by Robyn Creswell
The pianist was still droopy-eyed, her face as dark as the keys they left her to press for half a century, though she must have been white as an angel when they first strung her up in the heavy frame on the wall.
     Here amid the sighs of Umm Kalthum and the local wine of uncertain vintage, I thought my courage might come through that door next to the bar. While the garçon read his tabloid, and I slid among my options like drop of dew on a bunch of grapes, an Arab nationalist made an entrance, his hair all white as if he’d just been fighting off an invasion of the midan down the street.
     “The nation is on fire,” he said, instead of good evening, and I started coughing from the smoke that suddenly engulfed me.
    Intermittent barks from outside covered the sounds of sighing inside. The garçon would turn up the volume a notch for the Nightingale of the East, but the bitch’s howling won the battle. Soon she’d give birth to a couple of pups at least around the back of the building.
    The garçon should really stop the 1943 Rivoli record. Zakarriya Ahmad wouldn’t like this medley of oud, dog barks, and coughing under a colonial-era roof.
    I’d come back from a funeral that afternoon. A surgeon, just out of school, was waiting for me in a room he’d spent too much time tidying up.
     But my courage never came through the door—the sordid side door that separates the women’s room from the men’s urinal.","The pianist was still droopy-eyed, her face as dark as the keys they left her to press for half a century.

A Grave I’m about To Dig,"translated from the Arabic by Robyn Creswell

    As I return home with a dead bird in my hand, a little grave
I’m about to dig waits for us in the backyard. 
    No blood on the washed feathers, two outspread wings, 
and a dewdrop (some concentrate of spirit?) on its beak, as if 
it had flown for many days while actually dead. 
    Its fall was fated in the Lord’s eyes, heavy and diagonal in 
front of mine. 
    I’m the one who left my country back there to go for a walk 
in this forest, holding a dead bird whose absence the flock
never noticed, 
    returning home for a funeral that might have been a solemn 
one were it not for the sneakers on my feet. ","The bird's fall was fated in the Lord's eyes, heavy and diagonal in front of mine. No blood on the washed feathers, two outspread wings,  and a dewdrop (some concentrate of spirit?) on its beak."

Sippokni Sia,"I am old, Sippokni sia.
Before my eyes run many years,
Like panting runners in a race.
Like a weary runner, the years lag;
Eyes grow dim, blind with wood smoke;
A handkerchief binds my head,
For I am old. Sippokni sia.
Hands, once quick to weave and spin;
Strong to fan the tanchi;
Fingers patient to shape dirt bowls;
Loving to sew hunting shirt;
Now, like oak twigs twisted.
I sit and rock my grandson.
I am old. Sippokni sia.
Feet swift as wind o’er young cane shoots;
Like stirring leaves in ta falla dance;
Slim like rabbits in leather shoes;
Now moves like winter snows,
Like melting snows on the Cavanaugh.
In the door I sit, my feet in spring water.
I am old. Sippokni sia.
Black like crow’s feather, my hair.
Long and straight like hanging rope;
My people proud and young.
Now like hickory ashes in my hair,
Like ashes of old camp fire in rain.
Much civilization bow my people;
Sorrow, grief and trouble sit like blackbirds on fence.

Cold War,"If you can remember the cold war, you’re too old for me.

Thirteen Ways of Looking,"after David Hammons’s Close Your Eyes and See Black
1. Smear your forearms with something like shea butter or sunscreen and lean over a bright piece of paperboard, facedown. Hover there, then print your body onto to the paper below. See how your forearms, printed there, make the top half of a diamond?

2. There is no clear narrative. What is clear, scanning the artwork from top to bottom, are details of a naked, muscular torso: two nipples, a hairy chest in the shape of a heart, the elastic band and wrinkled beginnings of a pair of trousers—and strikingly, within the torso, the portrait of a face—cupped by two hands.

3. Close your eyes and see black.

4. What is the texture and mood of your blackness? What seeking, sweetness, or sorrows does it hold?

5. Then the bottom edge of the frame.

6. In Close Your Eyes and See Black, the white space is not white. It is golden, a deep royal hue. Everywhere the body print isn’t is the color of a peeled Georgia peach.

7. Place your hands over your head and make the shape of a diamond.

8. Back to the portrait of a face. It appears like a ghost: centered in the torso, centered in the lower half of the frame. It appears beneath the nipples and above the elastic of wrinkled pants. It appears to be a photographic image of a Black man. It appears this man is closing his eyes, is seeing black.

9. What blacknesses do you see? What blacknesses have printed themselves onto you?

10. To make this body print, David Hammons coated his hair, skin, and clothes with grease and pressed his body onto the paperboard. Then the artist dusted a dark pigment on top, which adhered to the grease’s stickiness.

11. There is no face in the top half of the art work. Instead, a negative space, a rich, golden hue breathes into the space of the diamond.

12. The color of a lucky, double-yolk egg.

13. What must it feel like to shine in shadow; to glow darkly in the sun?","David Hammons’s Close Your Eyes and See Black is a work of art. Hammons coated his hair, skin, and clothes with grease and pressed his body onto the paperboard. Then the artist dusted a dark pigment on top, which adhered to the grease's stickiness."
If They Come in the Morning,"after Kerry James Marshall’s Black Painting and after Fred Hampton

In the after of the painting’s scene 
sun slices, shoots through 
the room—but the now-painting
remains dark. In the days after, 
hundreds will tour the bloodshot 
house, I mean it was like 
what Mamie Till said: Leave 
the casket open, I need you to see 
what they did to my son. I can barely 
make out the painting’s two figures—remember
there are three: Akua is nine months pregnant 
next to Fred. I mean the police came 
so early morning resembled night, 
they shot through the mattress and killed 
and killed—Fred died and died.
The bed heavy with two bodies—one 
body heavy with a third, I’m asking you 
to remember. Three asleep at 4:30am. 
In the now-painting Fred’s body is hard 
to make out and alive. Soon he will be 
murdered. My eyes can barely decipher 
the two—remember three—draped 
in brushes of black paint. I am close now
to the painting, as close as catastrophe,
as close as mourning barreling into night.","Kerry James Marshall’s Black Painting depicts the murder of Fred Hampton. In the after of the painting, the now-painting remains dark. The painting is as close as catastrophe as it is as mourning."
Trans Study: Untitled 4 (Facial Expression),"Upon first glance, it is difficult to decipher a figure, much less a facial expression. Upon first glance, it is difficult, the figure. Upon first glance, there is no face. Upon first, undecipherable, the glance. It is difficult. It depends on who is looking. We might say: Upon first glance, we are in a dark room. We are behind our eyelids in the room. We are looking, in the dark. The figure before us is also behind the eyelids, their eyelids. It is as if neither we nor they are present to the other, though we are, looking, together, in and from the dark. We look to work out the other’s intentions. We cannot. We look. We breathe together inside the room inside. The figure, having been exposed, overexposed, to light has become like a shadow or a barely lit shape on the midnight lake. For the sake of simplicity, we could call the figure a man, but I will not. We are in the room that precedes all that. The cleavage of this from that. It goes: first darkness, then form. Remember that. Try. If we look too long at the lake what surfaces is the old thought—when I was a child, when I was a child—we are thrown back to before, not shame, but shame of shame. We become furious and wild-limbed and kind. We pass the clause between us, a rope tethering, tethering, taut. A poem, we’ve been taught, though we can’t say where, should leave this part out. We should rush from room to bright room so that we can be surprised by what we find. But the figure is still in the dark. They require our stillness. Our black breath. I am afraid, I say to no one, to be like this image. Upon first glance, unreachable. Exposed. When I was a child, there was a figure in the dark. A man. Let’s call him that. A man. I was a question. I was a question he answered. I was a question he held and demanded my stillness. Part of me lives in that room, still, though I left it with a new, wretched name. But—and I can say this now—he saw me, the man in the dark, when no one else could see me. When I was, in manner of speaking, difficult to decipher. A darkness before form. He held me. Stilled me. He brought me into the frame. We were two black men there, in the black, the close black, the black from which life, relentlessly, comes. The breath between us was cruel. But I could see him. Him. I could see the sorrow, the rage, the calm water, the father raising his fist, the unnamable quiet of his face.","When I was a child, there was a figure in the dark. A man. Let’s call him that. Part of me lives in that room, still, though I left it with a new, wretched name. He held me. He brought me into the frame."
Galleria Ode,"Something there is that doesn’t love the mall
where we used to chainsmoke on the mezzanine
 
and watch the escalator’s endless crawl
up from Häagen-Dazs to Chuck E. Cheese—
 
something so embarrassed by it all, it shatters glass 
and scatters yellow lading slips among the weeds,

and strips whole runs of copper from the walls
of what was once a Limited, a County Seat—

their slender mannequins spray-painted now
with cartoon boobs and cocks, unseen
 
until the new kids come to flash their phones
inside the ancient ruins of the Regal 6—

where webless, clueless, on our own,
we used to hold hands in the dark and kiss.","Inside the ancient ruins of the Regal 6, where webless, clueless, on our own, we used to hold hands in the dark and kiss. Their slender mannequins spray-painted now with cartoon boobs and cocks."

"Saturday, April 17, 2010 12:49 am","translated by Ilana Luna and Cheyla Samuelson
Water on water: the tone and the timbre. Impossible to describe the deep empty longing in the voice of birds. This childhood happened elsewhere. The light, as thin as a thread through the eye of the astral needle. Lyme Regis is a town on the coast. The howling of the wind. The taste of salt on the lips, on the neck, right on the tip of the nose. There’s a green that can only be perceived in dreams. There’s no echo without a wall, in effect. Then the girl turned to look at me: you still don’t remember this moment? she asked. Or said. In time I grew expert in wrapping myself up in a black cloak. Someone would sing on the other side of the world; someone else would raise their hand or their voice or their gaze. As far as I know Meryl Streep was never a redhead. Turning corners: the body that departs. Tolling bells: the body that will never return. But how white the foam on the crest of the waves looks! I’ll forget it, I had to admit. The accent marks the longest separation. Skimming: two words that fly over bodies of water, the ocean. What? she asked again. Stupefied is a spectacular adjective. Nobody abandoned you, I had to yell each word for her to hear me. The echo: the wall: the effect. Understanding is just as likely as misunderstanding. A body huddled between clouds. A corner. The voices travel over extremely long distances. The childhood that’s watching me. This sky.

  Agua contra agua: el tono y el timbre. Imposible describir la honda vacía añoranza en la voz de los pájaros. Esta infancia ocurrió en otro lugar. La luz, tan delgada como un hilo a través del ojo de la aguja estelar. Lyme Regis es un pueblo en una costa. El ulular del viento. El sabor a sal sobre los labios, en el cuello, justo en la punta de la nariz. Existe un verde que sólo es posible percibir en sueños. No hay eco sin pared, en efecto. Entonces la niña se volvió a verme: ¿todavía no recuerdas este momento?, preguntó. O dijo. Con el tiempo me hice experta en arroparme con una capa negra. Alguien cantaría en el otro extremo del mundo; alguien más elevaría la mano o la voz o la mirada. Que yo sepa Meryl Streep nunca fue pelirroja. Doblar las esquinas: el cuerpo que se va. Doblar las campanas: el cuerpo que no regresará. ¡Pero qué blanca luce la espuma en la cresta de las olas! Lo olvidaré, tuve que admitirlo. El acento sella la separación más larga. Al ras: dos palabras que sobrevuelan las aguas, el océano. ¿Qué?, volvió a preguntar. Atolondrado es un adjetivo espectacular. Nadie te abandonó, tuve que gritar cada palabra para que me oyera. El eco: la pared: el efecto. Entender es tan posible como malentender. Un cuerpo agazapado entre nube y nube. Una esquina. Las voces viajan distancias muy largas. La infancia que me ve. Este cielo."," Lyme Regis is a town on the coast. The howling of the wind. The taste of salt on the lips, on the neck, right on the tip of the nose. A green that can only be perceived in dreams."

In a Disused Graveyard,"The living come with grassy tread
To read the gravestones on the hill;
The graveyard draws the living still,
But never any more the dead.
The verses in it say and say:
“The ones who living come today
To read the stones and go away
Tomorrow dead will come to stay.”
So sure of death the marbles rhyme,
Yet can’t help marking all the time
How no one dead will seem to come.
What is it men are shrinking from?
It would be easy to be clever
And tell the stones: Men hate to die
And have stopped dying now forever.

goldenrod or blueberry or some other rambling growth

a passage. Quiet. Sometimes bright, sometimes dim, so, foreign.

Ant as a glass of water,"They ask and I say no because I figure they are unlikely to accept my answer anyway but they insist on an answer so I say fine, I’ll tell you.

You must continue to be human. But why. Because you are one now. All the more in my old age I would like to be a glass of water, I’d make such a nice glass of water, don’t you think? So useful, so desired. No no you cannot be a glass of water. Fine then I’ll be an ant. No you cannot be an ant. For the same reasons, I imagine. Yes. Please. Do continue to be human. But why won’t you even give me a chance. In fact, screw that—I’ll be an ant, and that ant will be a glass of water. I do not understand what you mean. Here’s what you can do with my old age. Swirl it first, to release the aroma. I am a well-tempered ant, a nicely adjusted glass of water. Breathe it in, my molecules of ant scent. Tip it to the left, to the right, watch the contents swish to the head, to the tail, and back again to the head.

Then there are many layers of something else, everything else, the world, for example, or more likely simply a space of time or geography or perhaps a curtain or a collared shirt or a person or several, various degrees of people and objects.
The last layer is the something beautiful, which lays itself down quietly on top of all these layers, none of which were waiting for this to happen, except that only by the happenstance of the arrival of this layer are the other layers actualized as such; a distance, a thickness, a slightly twitching texture is created between the first and last layers, a measurable distance that surfaces out of nowhere but an internal and external longing for a presence or good word.","Is layered as such, the first layer of it being thick, of substance, but of being matter and matterful.

until I unhooked 
from the saline drip
and danced until I pissed
myself, urine streaming pink
down my legs. Consider 
the wedding band
my husband removed
before I crushed
his hand at ten centimeters,
bit his knuckle as if excavating
myself from a wreck;
excrement and buckets of ice, 
the mirror someone placed 
between my legs until I understood 
I didn’t need it, closed my eyes
and orchestrated my own
resurrection, cupping the dark
oil of my daughter’s hair
as she emerged. Yes, I would have 
pulled my husband into the abyss with me,
tearing open in every direction 
like a star. I would have cracked 
his carpals like a piano’s brittle keys
like snapping the neck of a dove.
I would have burned the whole place down
to get where I needed to go.","Consider the perineum that stretched like cheap nylons each night. Consider the bloody asterisk of mucus plug,amniotic sac that refused to break. Consider  the wedding band that my husband removed before I crushed his hand."
I Pump Milk Like a Boss,"I pump milk on the side of the road where the grass is biblical green
as if first cousin to the cow, her pink and swollen tits immaculate
as the plumbing of a church organ sending up calls to god, brassy mesh                                
of notes, fermented and dank as kush. I pump milk with my bare hands
into a bar’s bathroom sink, above which is a mirror where someone’s scrawled
I Love Cricket Pussy and below that, Everyone Deserves to be Loved.
I look at myself under the fingered smudge, the bodily fluids spattered
like haikus and I pump as if my milk is propaganda,
fingers bowing across my chest like a pawnshop violin,
milky graffiti tagging the spit-clogged drain.
I pump like I’m writing my name in blood
which turns to the milk my child sucks dry, which she turns into blood.
I pump like I have a tattoo on my pudenda
that says Aerosmith backwards, I pump
as if my hands have teeth, one combat boot hitched up on the toilet seat,
each hiss of milk chanting like a choir yes bitch yes,
my tits bitten and salt-veined, as when my baby
took her first gulp of air, humming   
from the engorged crevasse of me
like a herd of wildebeest, as if the hive of me could have burst,
the infrared honey, the glop glop
of afterbirth dripping down my left leg,
spittle and amen, amniotic residue   
fluorescent with prayer—
Do men lactate is a popular google search and I wonder
what would happen if they could, our presidents
lifting their offspring to their breasts in the deep pockets
of night, listening to the dribble of milk
sipped from the pulpit of their bodies. Tonight my breasts
became so engorged I said I’d pay someone to suck my tits
half-joking. But a woman who heard followed me to the bathroom, read me
a sex poem while I pumped my milk, leaning away from the need in her voice
and the milk came slow and I pumped and waited for her to finish
and a streetlight scribbled in the parking lot
and I know there is a price we pay for loneliness
and a price we pay to forget it and I dedicate my libido
to my younger self and this is how I want to live, milk-stained, a little bit emptied,
a little bit in love with the abundance of my body,

which I will save long after it’s turned, praising its curdled glow

as if it’s enough to make me invincible.",The author pumps milk with her bare hands into a sink in a bar's bathroom sink. She says she is in love with the abundance of her body and wants to live with it.

Dunes,"When I finally reached them, a young father 
was trying to teach his daughter how to cast. 
She flicked her wrist, overshot, found the motion 
the second time around. I’d run four miles 
to get here & didn’t think I’d make it, then sat 
awhile attempting to be still, to regard the teenagers 
stripping down to their suits with recognition, 
kindness, & not my usual judgment aimed inward. 
Yesterday, an ecologist was explaining how 
so much in nature forms from loss—take beaches, 
he’d said, damage the desired state for a certain 
kind of growth. On the walk home my feet hurt, 
I came across a turtle in the road, flies attaching 
to its split shell, & waited for someone else 
to move it. Like how she’d told me I needed 
to open, but how? I mean it literally: I can’t figure 
out the mechanics. Online another poet vows 
not to collude anymore with modes of despair. 
But what about the opposite, what it would mean 
to shelter despair like a child or childhood pet? 
This is me trying to make an opening. For some-
thing unformed to enter. A new kind of noticing. 
The willingness to risk failure for the possibility
of love. On the dunes, a dark-haired woman walking 
barefoot along the shoreline smiled as she passed. 
I smiled back. Farther out now, the teenagers 
splashed in the waves, & as I listened to the pitch 
of their voices could tell they weren’t teenagers 
at all but somewhere in the middle of their lives.",The poet is trying to make an opening for some-                thing unformed to enter. The willingness to risk failure for the possibility of love is a new kind of noticing.
No One’s Looking,"Lately waking at an indeterminate hour, 
I know no one’s looking for me. 

I could walk across a bridge & back
or burrow in, king of my oscillating 

fan. Minutes sag like low branches 
in snow. I’m taking my adulthood slow, 

like medicine. Arranging flowers in a vase 
is something nice to do for yourself, 

that color rush, serotonin spike, even if 
they won’t survive the week. The cut stems 

stripped of function, the smaller griefs
in that. Like how my niece at night stands 
in her crib refusing sleep, eyelids fluttering
open, closed. Soon, all the world’s 

nieces will be old enough to want another 
earth, a second chance, as we warm 

by degrees. We’re at a boil now, over-
flowing with want. These are trying times. 

But time’s trying, asking us to stay awhile
longer inside the length of this moment.","I’m taking my adulthood slow,  grotesquely like medicine. Arranging flowers in a vase is something nice to do for yourself, even if they won’t survive the week."
Once I Was in Love,"with all my friends     & sometimes still am

This Is My Heart For You,"1.
First: Rain on the mountain, marching over the mountain
like straight-down ghosts made real once they pinprick
the surface of the water. A distant thunder
that could be mistaken for the blasting
they are doing over yonder where another
mountain is being hauled out one piece at a time.
            You can see an entire entity passing beneath
            your feet if you pause on the bridge above the tracks.
But here, on this bridge, Troublesome churns underneath
us, brown and foamy. All the other little
creeks have ganged up and poured off the cliffs and hillsides
to their great way out, good old Troublesome
O Troublesome O Troublesome O good old creek.
2.
Turn on the faucet next morning and out comes
the water orange, the color of earth
that gets trapped way way down in the metallic
rocky canals that hide within the clefts
of mountains. O secret secret O holy
holy these places are, little hidden
spaces only known by God. We are a people
used to our water being tainted for don’t we
live in just such a world every determined
day of our lives when our mothers are telling
us we are not like them and our fathers
are yelling and waving pistols and all the world
says no, you are wrong wrong wrong very wrong.
But here, on Troublesome, we are of one mind,
of one family and perhaps the creek
is our mother, maybe the mountain is
our mother. The black gum and sycamores
they comfort us, the red fox who comes out during
the sermon is our kin. Lord Lord Lord
what lurks among the gloaming’s cedars,
watching us as we go about our busyness?
The wise old woodlanders sit back and they are pleased,
amused by our honesty that knows
no bounds here yet is tucked away in a little
box made of leaves when we are in the places
we call our homes but are not, really.
Otherwise we would not love this haunted place so much.
3.
Do Lord O Do Lord O Do remember me
the woman sings and we do we do we remember
remember remember. We are all memory
and remembering. This is my heart for you.
We are holding on with white knuckles and we mourn
for what we have not been able to clutch, we mourn
it and preserve it and make it into poems
and songs and books and jars of pickled corn
we can sit on the window sill to catch the light.
You cannot put back a mountain but you can
carry its stories strapped to your back like medicine
bundles, you can make a tattoo of them
on the underside of your arm. You can sew them
onto the unseen parts of your mouth This is my
hand for you, outstretched, unfolded, unclenched—
everything but uncertain. Read them
the way the wise old-timers read the leaves
and the skies and wooly-worms. Read them and tell me
what you see in our past, in our creek,
on the side of our mountain. There is language
in the kudzu and it is all ours and belongs
to no one else. This is my tongue for you,
whispering our history: words words words.
4.
All week long the rain came and went, as did the stories.
Sometimes all would be as still as the voices
of sleeping birds, the leaves breathing against
the wooden shingles of the chapel, the graves
all wet and mossy. Not many mornings
were the spiders able to build their webs
in the corners of the bridge for the rains washed
them away. But always there were the words
and the songs and a thousand different kinds
of joys and griefs. All the while the people were singing
and the creek was running and the mountains
were breathing their last breaths and the kudzu was growing,
just waiting for the moment when it would overtake
every little bit of it, but the people
there cherished it anyway for it was their symbol,
the kudzu. Kudzu, kudzu, a word they sang
and claimed like their own although it came across the sea,
just like them, just like the vine itself. All
things that take up residence must first travel
and find their own secret places in the waiting world.","The poem is called ""Troublesome O Troublesome"" and is written in the language of the kudzu. The author says the creek is the mother of the family and the mountain is their mother."
Cumberland Falls,"O, let them be…
Gerard Manley Hopkins
In high school the biggest dare was to slink 
over the slick rocks flanking Cumberland Falls, 
where the wide but shallow river dives 
seventy feet into a deep pool of froth.
There, people say, catfish big as men twist 
and slither, awaiting suppers sped
their way. You can see a rainbow at night, 
shimmering on the mist during a full
moon and a clear sky. This is true. I snuck
behind the green curtain once with my best
friend, whose name I won’t say because he
never came out. Just as we reached the veil
of water where we would disappear
into another world, I slipped. My right
leg slid down the cold boulder and before
I could plunge into the churning chaos
where torrent met river, he grabbed hold
of my hand. I was so electrified
by his touch I didn’t think of how close
I was to being swept away.
Instead I thought how a small moment
of ecstasy is akin to drowning.
He held on for a beat longer
than necessary. The roar behind
the falls was a deafening symphony heard
only by those brave enough
to penetrate this darksome cavern
carved by centuries. Fern-laden, alive
with the smell of moss. A secret cathedral
made of wildness and wet. We were mesmerized,
and stood watching the cascade as if frozen
yet, as if we might see through to the other side.","Gerard Manley Hopkins is the author of the novel ‘The Secret Cathedral’. The book is based on a trip to Cumberland Falls, where Hopkins and a friend took a dare to sneak behind a green curtain to watch a waterfall. Hopkins: ‘I was so electrified by his touch I didn’t think of how close I was to being swept away’"
Ohio Listening,"It’s autumn in Ohio
Things to be done
Visit the doctor 
Before leaves fall. 
Autumn in Ohio
Black birds southward bound
Darkening the sky
North winds congregate
In fields of dry stalks
A loose shingle rattling 
On the roof. 
Autumn in Ohio
Repairs to be made
Firewood to gather 
Loved ones to hold 
Before the leaves turn gold
And the hawk descends 
Formidable cold. ","It’s autumn in Ohio. Things to be done: visit the doctor, repair the roof, gather firewood. Black birds bound southward bound. North winds congregate."
Calvin Hernton Seeks to Build and Preserve a House,"To Mildred
  I
Where shall the monument begin
Upon what foundation 
How shall the True House be erected? 

Now you are going away 
I will miss you, I will be lonely, 
I will worry and know sleepless nights
So terrible 
I shall walk dark streets 
Sit in darker places 
And drink     and brood. 

After having pressed my mouth to yours
Lived each breath of your breathing 
After having been told that I am loved 
After having loved, 
In so short a space within confines so desolate, 
Now that you are leaving
I shall walk quietly into a church 
Kneel there before the alter
And pray. 

II

How shall love’s monument begin? 
Upon what foundation shall it be erected? 
Christ died but on the third day he rose. 

The True House is the Temple of God
It is built upon the foundation of the Rock. 
The True Temple is the family. 
Love is the rock. 

The first and last, the indivisible, the
Ever prevailing, undisputable 
Rock! 

III

Once erected
How shall the Temple be preserved? 
I have seen men curse God      in God’s name. 
I see a world filled with haters. 
I see people dancing a dance who have forgotten the meaning, or twisted it 
Beyond its Truth. 
I hear confused, hopeless tongues uttering hopeful words. 

How shall the Truth be preserved? 
Now that you are leaving
I shall be alone. 

IV

Tell them the Temple is based upon
A solid foundation
Tell them the True House of God is created out of love and marriage! 
Conceived by Children
Through the placing-on lips in nights soft as the fur of freshly born kittens
Tell them the True Temple is not an organization for the purpose of self-aggrandizement
Or national expediancy—
The family is a religious institution. 

And when you depart from me, my love, 
Remember, 
                 take this monument with Thee 
                 forget not the altar, where the candle of 
Resurrection flickers about the profile of my 
                 tearful face. 

V

And remember! 
Once erected, even then the True House
Is not so easily preserved. For 
There are those, envious, begrudging, 
Of the house, 
                unbelievers, who stand without, that 
Will strive, will strike out boldly
                  or cowardly
Against the True Temple.
Those who for various and often unscrutinized motives, 
Those who, while standing upon the Rock, will oppose 
                and offend, 
Those who will strive to arrest and destroy

The one Truth
The only House. 

VI

Shall I grieve? 
You know grief will be mine. 
You know I love you committedly and will 
                 suffer during your absence 
Remember! 
The True House is the True Temple
I love you 
              and want to marry. 

The True Temple
The Rock 
The Cathedral 
Must be built from within 
It will prevail against those who oppose
               from without 
               against those who offend. 
It must be built on Love. 

This is the way it must be erected
This is the way it begins
This is the way the family will survive 

This is the monument. 
                    

 ","The True House is the Temple of God, built upon the foundation of the Rock. Love is the rock, the first and last, the indivisible, the undisputable, undisputable Rock!"
"Crossing Brooklyn Bridge at 4 O’Clock in the Morning, August 4th, 1979","Oh, love spat upon and made mockery of! 

The night’s sorrow
This heart of moon tears in the darkest before sunrise 
This aloneness after betrayal
Dust blown grit of yesterday rot 
This suffocating thirst
This ache to plunge into oblivion!

I, shoulder hunched, hands balled into my pockets, shivering in the cold
Stand at this time morning facing the Bridge of Brooklyn leading across into Manhattan, 
My bridegroom feet covered in running shoes torn by nails of jilt, 
My legs of lactic acid, my knees weakening upon the grates of the bridge, 
My gin eyes, drooped as the lowering of curtains around the one who is dying, 
Peer down into the waters of absolution and scream your name, 
Walt Whitman! Walt Whitman! Walt Whitman! 

Poet of ferry boats and of poets ages hence to come, 
Wound dresser, washer of the slave’s feet, 
Dream keeper who sleeps with prisoners in slumber, 
Oh, nurse of eternal compassion! 
Ferry me across these waters of deceit. 
Bear me safely over this bridge of steel and concrete
That I may live to shed this grief. ",Walt Whitman’s poem ‘The Bridge of Brooklyn’ was written in the late 1800s. The poem is about the pain of losing a loved one. It is set against the backdrop of the Brooklyn Bridge.

I Believe I Remember Love,"My mother was transforming
another tough pot roast into meat loaf,
grinding up chunks of gristly beef, bovine scraps
she’d boned off a shoulder blade.
As she bore down on the stiff
crank handle & fed the iron gullet
of the meat grinder, the auger hole, I stood
beside her, a shadow, not yet two,
held onto the counter & cutting board, listened to
the squish & roar of meat pushing through
spaghetti sized holes. I was mesmerized
by those oozing red hamburger strings.
In a flash I reached up & plugged a hole
with my finger to stop the flow, didn’t know about
the slashing, windmilling knives
turning industriously, cleaving all meat.
My mother & I screamed, cried hysterically,
held hands & a dish towel full of blood
while my dad drove the thirty miles of curvy
road, a two lane along the river, cussing,
full throttle. They hustled me through the lobby
of the clinic, brick & glass. I saw wheel chairs,
white gowns running about, watched
an overhead light fade. Finally, at home
I remember sitting on the floor in overalls,
a lemon sucker in one hand & plaster
cast on the other, people laughing, smiling at me:
the fabled ""Little Dutch Boy"" who survived
the flood. I was the talk of the neighborhood,
the focus of the family. My first memory,
that trauma, was perfect drama. An audience brings
us joy. Our greatest happiness is
the belief we are loved. It’s what we live for,
what we desire most. We learn to tolerate
any pain, risk blood or breath, anything, if
we believe we are loved, right now, forever.",My mother was transforming another tough pot roast into meat loaf. I was mesmerized by those oozing red hamburger strings. An audience brings us joy. Our greatest happiness is the belief we are loved.

Credo,"Fractal: a cascade of never-ending, self-similar, repeated
elements that change in scale but retain similar shape.
A
cascade 
of 
infinite 
is why
I believe in 
loops 
and spirals, 
subtle shifts, cycles.
My son, preschooler stunned 
by
the science museum, 
sticks his hand 
into a glacier, 
the chunk 
a broken testimony, 
the history 
of
a world dissolving. Cold!
It’s cold! And
it’s melting. Look right here, he says.
Similarities 
of self
astonish. I see them in 
architecture,
geometry a welcome language, 
shapes
a new alphabet for
prayer and song.
I study Peter Eisenman’s
House 11a
lapping up patterns, interlocking Ls, 
squares and 
replicated rectangles—
the syntax of
ideas. For Frank Gehry’s Guggenheim 
in
Bilbao, syntax looks like
titanium scales rhyming across curves. Glass 
and limestone 
patterns, similarities of 
visual texture,
are creations of weight, depth; order breaks 
tension
where the lines turn. A cascade 
of repeating elements grounds my belief in 
humanity
as mystery. Signs appear: a sound, 
song,
and syllable mean things.
Armadillo! Armadillo! sings my son, 
the youngest,
using his Louis Armstrong
voice; grit gives way to twang and twang turns into hard-rock screams.
He’s an oracle
at four years old, an armor-clad mammal 
his muse.
My oldest son speaks in code, 
echolalia a symptom of a seizure-
besieged brain. When
he utters, No, and No, and No, and 
No,
then I don’t know I don’t know I don’t know, I listen for 
a divine voice revealed.
Cascades changing in scale, not shape, is why I 
trust weight, depth, height-materials and thingness:
Saturn’s rings, the Pacific coastline, bolts of lightning, 
a Romanesco 
cauliflower, angelica flower-
heads, veins
of sycamore leaves, seashells, snowflakes, blood vessels, DNA.
A range and scope of fractals 
inspire awe, a cascade of never-ending 
wonder at both 
connections and aberrations as 
well
as places of perfect order and broken patterns. When 
I consider what we
may be reduced-sized copies of, I grapple 
with insight;
it hovers in physics and biology, the shapes of letters, 
the magic of new languages,
the mystery of cells and synapses, the music 
of my sons’ voices,
the geometries of buildings and trees.
Sometimes
I glimpse an answer, something like seeing starlight years after 
the star dies, supernovas.
Four hours before my youngest son’s birth, I dreamed 
my sister, dead
31 years, placed him in my arms: Take care of him, she said. He has 
her eyes, ice-blue and illumined by 
God.","Fractal is a cascade of never-ending, self-similar, repeated elements that change in scale but retain similar shape. A cascade of repeating elements grounds my belief in humanity as mystery."
When my OB/GYN Said He Didn't Understand Poetry,"I worried because my body 
is a more complex text.
When he feels the shape 
of my uterus, he may not 
think pear-shaped yet 
an apricot in size, hollow 
butternut squash, lightbulb.
He may not consider it a bowl 
for a daughter developing inside 
with eggs for her daughters, 
a set like Grandma’s Tupperware 
poised to seal away meals, 
or nested like Russian dolls, 
copies waiting to be twisted off, 
revealed. My doctor speaks 
the body’s language: uterus 
tilted toward spine could 
mean incarceration—womb 
snagged on the pelvic bone.
Almond-shaped ovaries pocked 
like plum pits—if swollen 
with movable lumps— 
could be dermoid, endometrioma, 
or chocolate cysts. Or nothing 
to worry about. He questions
structure, unpuzzles chromosomes, 
scrutinizes tensions between 
biopsies and blood work, and reads 
all this alongside testimony 
and history because my flesh, 
like a poem, carries mystery: 
it produced one child complete
But jettisoned the next four.
My doctor’s glossing of my uterine
purse—whether it will fill and stay full
or remain empty—eludes his science.
But when I build a nest of words,
paradox and ambiguity kiss each time,
offspring running down the page.","I worried because my body                 is a more complex text. My doctor speaks the body’s language: uterus tilted toward spine could mean incarceration. I build a nest of words,paradox and ambiguity kiss each time."

A building’s a building…. I mean, it’s all structure.

I need villanelles of you pulling 
my breath like lines moving down
the page and the promise of rhyme 
bending my ear. I need a sestina
of touch, patterns of palm, stroke,
skim, brush, and rub returning—
a cycle of sound and pressure I
apprehend in my bones. I need
the triolet’s refrain rolling off 
your tongue like a sample, new
and nuanced here and here and here.
It’s all structure is why I need angles
of play, the love our bodies build.

than a dropped foot, a forced rhyme.

what will you jettison first? Meter?
Lines? Come home. Our sonnet’s

Cognitive Dissonance,"On 11th street, Saturday October 15th,
on a street with “Black Art Matters” color the pavement

lift up the highway that tears the city in two
& “Black lives matter” is embroidered in a local shop’s window,
I see no Black people. Unless it is MLK day,
or intentional congregations of underfunded Black events,
Black folk retreat to their far-away corners, speaking some
variation of English that sounds like squeaking
styrofoam to those who populate 11th street. My car glides
down a road where a venue, a member of the Chitlin circuit
still stands only cause of national designation,
everything around it fresh as a new gun,
down a road where a monument honors–
through force – Black people in Texas. Down a road
where homies learned how to play ball, tie
their new Christmas shoes, live big despite the meager
bounties put on their heads by this city a century prior,
& it’s nothing but white people. The internet says
In Austin, East 11th is the New SoCo
Homies say In Austin? Our lease is up in February
What is a city if not a slowly rotating thing
baking its Blackness at the speed of capital? Every street,
in every city eager for all the wrong reasons,

The Host of the Air,"O’Driscoll drove with a song,
The wild duck and the drake,
From the tall and the tufted weeds
Of the drear Hart Lake.
And he saw how the weeds grew dark
At the coming of night tide,
And he dreamed of the long dim hair
Of Bridget his bride.
He heard while he sang and dreamed
A piper piping away,
And never was piping so sad,
And never was piping so gay.
And he saw young men and young girls
Who danced on a level place
And Bridget his bride among them,
With a sad and a gay face.
The dancers crowded about him,
And many a sweet thing said,
And a young man brought him red wine
And a young girl white bread.
But Bridget drew him by the sleeve,
Away from the merry bands,
To old men playing at cards
With a twinkling of ancient hands.
The bread and the wine had a doom,
For these were the host of the air;
He sat and played in a dream
Of her long dim hair.
He played with the merry old men,
And thought not of evil chance,
Until one bore Bridget his bride
Away from the merry dance.
He bore her away in his arms,
The handsomest young man there,
And his neck and his breast and his arms
Were drowned in her long dim hair.
O’Driscoll scattered the cards
And out of his dream awoke:
Old men and young men and young girls
Were gone like drifting smoke;
But he heard high up in the air
A piper piping away,
And never was piping so sad,
And never was piping so gay.","O’Driscoll drove with a song, the wild duck and the drake,                From the tall and the tufted weeds                Of the drear Hart Lake.                And he saw how the weeds grew darkAt the coming of night tide,ipientAnd he dreamed of the long dim hair                Of Bridget his bride."

The footwork, the kickers
The works
The guy was one you’d think knew about ceremony
With his gauges and a ponytail
When the polkas played, when it came to the glide
There was so much at stake in adobe

Older men in SAS botas shined and worked the pearl

In little dresses, lisping through the town?
Great men on horses hunt you, and strong boys
Employ their arrows in the shallow air.
But I shall be heard whistling where I follow

In pendent rhythm, and all the wayside loud;

Under the Poplars,"Translated from the Spanish by Yvette Siegert
For José Eulogio Garrido
Like inscrutable imprisoned bards,
the blood poplars have gone to sleep.
Out on the hills, the Bethlehem sheep
mouth their grassy arias for the fallen sun.
An ancient shepherd, shaken
to see the light in these martyr throes,
has caught up in his paschal eyes
a batch of chaste and lambent stars.
Cast in orphanhood, he goes down
at word of burial to the praying grounds,
and his shears are autumned with shade.
What’s left of blue is woven dark
in iron lines, and a hound in him with drooping eyes
is chasing after it with his country bark.
    Bajo los álamos
  Para José Eulogio Garrido
Cual hieráticos bardos prisioneros,
los álamos de sangre se han dormido.
Rumian arias de yerba al sol caído,
las greyes de Belén en los oteros.
El anciano pastor, a los postreros
martirios de la luz, estremecido,
en sus pascuales ojos ha cogido
una casta manada de luceros.
Labrado en orfandad baja al instante
con rumores de entierro, al campo orante;
y se otoñan de sombra las esquilas.
Supervive el azul urdido en hierro,
y en él, amortajadas las pupilas,
traza su aullido pastoral un perro.","For José Eulogio Garrido, the blood poplars have gone to sleep. The Bethlehem sheepmouth their grassy arias for the fallen sun. An ancient shepherd is caught up in these martyr throes."

The color of old clothes. July in shadows
and August just cut down, and a hand
made of water that grafted its bad fruit
onto a pine of resin and languor.
Now you’ve dropped anchor, dark clothes—
you dampen with the sumptuous scents
of time, of brevities . . . and I have sung of
festive tendencies turned upside down.
But can’t you do something about death,
Lord, about limits, about all that ends?
Oh, this wound the color of old clothes,
it splits, it smells of scalded honey.
Oh, exalted unity—how one thing stands for all.
Love against space and love against time.
The singular beat of the heart,
it has but a single rhythm: God.
And as the boundaries shrug
in disdain both coarse and insurmountable,
a stream of serpents is scattering
upon the damsel abundance of 1.

tornas rociada de un suntuoso olor
a tiempo, a abreviación. . . Y he cantado
el proclive festín que se volcó.
Mas, no puedes, Señor, contra la muerte,
contra el límite, contra lo que acaba?
Ay! la llaga en color de ropa antigua,
cómo se entreabre y huele a miel quemada!

por todos!
Amor contra el espacio y contra el tiempo!

of the goblet, and ever westward,
with such a vanquished, aching stern?

its verses while wandering out in the blue.

Distant Footsteps,"translated from the Spanish by Yvette Siegert
My father is sleeping. His noble features
reflect a gentle heart.
How sweet he is;
if anything in him is bitter, it must be me.
There is solitude at home, and prayer,
and there isn’t any news of the children today.
My father wakes up. He considers
the flight into Egypt, the bitter goodbye.
How near he is;
if anything in him is distant, it must be me.
And my mother, who moves through
the orchard, tasting a taste grown tasteless:
how soft she is,
how very wing, how departure, how love.
There is solitude at home, no sound,
no news, no green, no childhood.
And if anything this afternoon is broken,
and is going down and creaking,
it’s two old lanes white and curving,
and my heart is walking along them now.
    Los pasos lejanos
  Mi padre duerme. Su semblante augusto
figura un apacible corazón;
está ahora tan dulce. . . 
si hay algo en él de amargo, seré yo.
Hay soledad en el hogar; se reza;
y no hay noticias de los hijos hoy.
Mi padre se despierta, ausculta
la huída a Egipto, el restañante adiós.
Está ahora tan cerca;
si hay algo en él de lejos, seré yo.
Y mi madre pasea allá en los huertos,
saboreando un sabor ya sin sabor.
Está ahora tan suave,
tan ala, tan salida, tan amor.
Hay soledad en el hogar sin bulla,
sin noticias, sin verde, sin niñez.
Y si hay algo quebrado en esta tarde,
y que baja y que cruje,
son dos viejos caminos blancos, curvos.
Por ellos va mi corazón a pie.","There is solitude at home, no sound, no news, no green, no childhood. My father considers the flight into Egypt, the bitter goodbye. My mother moves through the orchard tasting a taste grown tasteless."

In memoriam
Brother, today I’m sitting out on the bench of our house,
where we miss the world out of you.
I remember us playing at this hour, and how Mamá
would soothe us with her “There now, boys. . .”
First it’s my turn to hide,
the way I used to, from all the evening
prayers, and I hope you will not find me.
Through the parlour, the foyer, the corridors.
Now it’s your turn, and I can’t find you.
We’d make each other cry, brother,
whenever we played this game.
Miguel, you hid yourself
one night in August, it was almost morning,
but instead of laughing, you were down.
And here your twin heart, from those days
that are all extinct now, is tired of not finding you.
A shadow is lengthening over my soul.
Listen, brother, don’t be late
in turning up, all right? Mamá will start to worry.

nos acariciaba: “Pero, hijos. . .”

como antes, todas estas oraciones
vespertinas, y espero que tú no des conmigo.
Por la sala, el zaguán, los corredores.
Después, te ocultas tú, y yo no doy contigo.
Me acuerdo que nos hacíamos llorar,
hermano, en aquel juego.
Miguel, tú te escondiste
una noche de agosto, al alborear;
pero, en vez de ocultarte riendo, estabas triste.
Y tu gemelo corazón de esas tardes
extintas se ha aburrido de no encontrarte. Y ya
cae sombra en el alma.

en salir. Bueno? Puedo inquietarse mamá.","Miguel and his brother hid themselves from their mother in a game of hide-and-go-seek. Miguel's twin heart is tired of not finding him, and his shadow is lengthening."

he languishes, a sweet disdainful lover.
How his heart must ache.

this late day, when I am full of love and
turn to the rigged balance of a pair of breasts
to weigh and grieve this frail creation.

of such magnificent encircling breasts. . .

because you never smile, because of how
your heart must always hurt you.

that I’m evil, but they do not know

in my metaphysical state

why, in my verses, the scouring
winds unravel from the Sphinx,
busybody of the Desert,
to screech, off-key,
a casket’s dark displeasure.
They all know. . . but they do not know
that the Light is consumptive
while the Shadow is corpulent.
They do not know how Mystery can synthesize. . .

Friends with No Benefits,"I now replace desire

Instead of saying, I want you, I say, 
there is meaning between us.
Meaning can swim, has taken lessons from the river

I now replace intensity with meaning.
One is a black hole of boundless appetite, a false womb,
another is a sentence.

and a “mother” for everything else.
She doesn’t get that it’s all language. There is no else. 
Else is a fiction of life, and a fact of death.

We ruin nothing. 
We get bagels in the morning before you leave on a train, 
and I smoke a skinny cigarette and think 
I look glam, like an Italian diva.

but a way to say I know you. 
I don’t feed on you. Instead, I watch you 
like a faraway tree. 
Desire loves the what if, the if only, the maybe in another lifetime. 
She loves a parallel universe. Or seven. 
Meaning knows its minerals,
knows which volcanic magma belongs 
to which volcanic fleet.
Knows the earth has parents. That a person is raised. 
It’s the real flirtation, to say, you are not a meal.

I have given myself to the linear     to 
the straight line. 
No longer turning. 
No longer considering 
that which could 
have occurred. 
I’m a rocket blasting into 
the unknowable. 
No more pondering     forever 
heavy     forever sick with it. 
No longer booming fados. 
Or sitting in rooms with suicidal 
guitarists plucking sunrise. 
No more addiction among addicts. 
I’m confessing this to them. 
They are moaning. 
They are asking me to leave. 
I leave you here. ",I’m a rocket blasting into  the unknowable. You lead me to that place where addicts give themselves up. I have given myself to the linear    to  the straight line.

"You, Emblazoned","for Kelly Caldwell (1988–2020)
Yet your voice was here—
                         just there-here in our house, shining eyes
who dazzled twice, already timed,
a pulsing wind below the glass in spring,
and coaxed, intelligent, stoic, touching everything, you stirred
me to life, in spite of illness and damage
to the country, field laid waste, election blaze, illness
wasting a brain, a mind. Mars, and ocean, canceled.
Cream and streamers, canceled, 
                                                  censored. 
“I am,” you said, 
                         though your skin flickered
to hackberry bark, or as bullet 
pierced pineal gland, blinking out
your day-night clock. Your syllables
endure frail days, which blow
through equinox, dissipate, time out—
            you imagined the planet
            with you already gone:
a sad expression, no real loss, the earth still a wild salon,
yet the name you chose
is etched into air, a violent wind
parts my chest, tenderviolet, electric
nights in our sheets, no longer 
countable, unrecounted. You, here, again,
my is-are-were, have-been-is, in my 
arms, bed is-was our house-eyes, in my 
only thought only root only gone,
my big only gone still here voice
blazing, I mourn you-her, 
her-you, who were born-dreamed into the world’s thicket
yet reinvented through an inner radiance, 
the radiance of a name, 
the name that is yours,
the radiance that is-was yours 
                                    that is-was you—","Kelly Caldwell was a U.S. senator from New Hampshire from 1988 to 2020. She died of cancer in 2011. Caldwell wrote a book about her life, ""Kelly Caldwell: A Memoir"""

a desperate blue tunnel

a corner of sunlight

a violence, words that die
before meaning:
relentless shredded threads.
I remember myself;
sky chained to torture,
futurity chokes:
an ancient throat melts
in my posing.

a swipe in the dust

Let No Charitable Hope,"Now let no charitable hope
Confuse my mind with images
Of eagle and of antelope:
I am by nature none of these.

The little nourishment I get.
In masks outrageous and austere
The years go by in single file;
But none has merited my fear,
And none has quite escaped my smile.","""I am, being woman, hard beset;I live by squeezing from a stone,"" she writes. ""None has merited my fear, and none has quite escaped my smile"""

Every day, I come to watch you pass,
little steamer, magical and always distant. . . 
Your eyes are a pair of blondish captains,
your lip a slip of kerchief, red and
bidding its blood goodbyes.
I will come to watch you pass—
drunk on time, on cruelty, you magical
little steamer, always distant—until that day
when the evening star takes leave.
The rigging, the traitor winds, the currents
from a woman who just walked past—
Then your cold captains will issue orders,
And the one to take leave will be me.

embriagada de tiempo y de crueldad,

Plaster,"Translated from the Spanish by Yvette Siegert
Silence. Night has fallen here already.
The sun has gone down behind the tombs,
And now a thousand eyes are crying,
Do not come back. My heart is dead already. 
Silence. Where everything is fitted in
A stiff lament, and this passion is like
Mediocre kerosene that barely burns.
Spring will come. You will sing “Eve”
From a narrow ledge, from the furnace
Where Eros kindles his spikenards.
Forge a pardon there for the poet,
Though it is sure to hurt me,
Like the nail that seals the coffin. 
But . . . there will come a lyrical night when
Your fine breasts, your red sea
Will crash with the waves of your fifteen years,
Once you spy, far off and full of memory,
My corsair, my ingratitude.
Then your apple orchard, your lips, yielding
To be creased a final time, to die
With the blood of too much love,
Like a Jesus sketched profanely—
Oh, my love. And you will start singing—
The female part of my soul reverberating
Like a cathedral in its grief. 
    Yeso
  Silencio. Aquí se ha hecho ya de noche,
ya tras del cementerio se fué el sol;
aquí se está llorando a mil pupilas:
no vuelvas; y murió mi corazón.
Silencio. Aquí ya todo está vestido
de dolor riguroso; y arde apenas,
como un mal kerosene, esta pasión.
Primavera vendrá. Cantarás “Eva”
desde un minute horizontal, desde un
hornillo en que arderán los nardos de Eros.
¡Forja allí tu perdón para el poeta,
que ha de dolerme aún,
como clavo que Cierra un ataúd!
Mas . . . una noche de lirismo, tu
buen seno, tu mar rojo
se azotará con olas de quince años,
al ver lejos, aviado con recuerdos
mi corsario bajel, mi ingratitud.
Después, tu manzanar, tu labio dándose,
y que se aja por mí por la vez última,
y que muere sangriento de amar mucho,
como un croquis pagano de Jesús.
Amada! Y cantarás;
y ha de vibrar el femenino en mi alma,
como en una enlutada catedral.","The poem is written in Spanish and is titled ""Silencio"" It is about the poet and the poet's love for the poet, Eva."
Fresco,"Translated from the Spanish by Yvette Siegert
I came to confuse her with myself,
and how! Through all her spiritual
meanderings, I continued
to play in the strawberry fields,
in the sunrise of her Grecian hands.
After this, she’d come to adjust
my black, unruly tie, and I’d
go back to observing the stone
in its absorption, and the fallow benches,
and the clock that reeled us in
at every stroke of its eternal clockwork.
Good nights they were,
that make me laugh now,
for the strange manner of my dying,
for my brand of ruminations.
Golden confections,
sugary gems
that finally crumble
beneath the stony mortar of this world.
But if your tears are tears of love,
the morning stars are lovely silks,
in lilacs
and oranges
and greens,
soaking full of the heart.
And if their silken threads get choked with bile,
then another silk, all great and apocalyptic,
will reach down from a certain love,
one never born, and one that never dies
—blue, unedited, the hand of God.
    Fresco
  Llegué a confundirme con ella,
tanto. . . ! Por sus recodos
espirituales, yo me iba
jugando entre tiernos fresales,
entre sus griegas manos matinales.
Ella me acomodaba después los lazos negros
y bohemios de la corbata. Y yo
volvía a ver la piedra
absorta, desairados los bancos, y el reloj
que nos iba envolviendo en su carrete,
al dar su inacabable molinete.
Buenas noches aquellas,
que hoy la dan por reír
de mi extraño morir,
de mi modo de andar meditabundo.
Alfeñiques de oro,
joyas de azúcar
que al fin se quiebran en
el mortero de losa de este mundo.
Pero para las lágrimas de amor,
los luceros son lindos pañuelitos
lilas,
naranjas,
verdes,
que empapa el corazón.
Y si hay ya mucha hiel en esas sedas,
hay un cariño que no nace nunca,
que nunca muere,
vuela otro gran pañuelo apocalíptico,
la mano azul, inédita de Dios!","I came to confuse her with myself, and how! Through all her spiritual meanderings, I continued to play in the strawberry fields. Good nights they were, that make me laugh now, for the strange manner of my dying, for my brand of ruminations."
Summer,"Translated from the Spanish by Yvette Siegert
Summer, I am leaving. And how they pain me,
These meek hands of your afternoons. 
You arrive devout; you arrive old; and now
You will find my soul with no one in it. 

Oh, summer. You pass through my balconies
With your great rosary of amethyst and gold
Like a tragic bishop who travels far
To find and bless the broken 
Rings of two dead lovers. 

Summer, I am leaving. And there in September,
You will find a rose I’ve left especially in your care,
For you to tend to with holy water
On all the days of sin and tombs.

If, from all the sobbing, the mausoleum
Should spread its marble wings in the light of faith,
Lift up your voice and pray to God
The light stays dead forever.
Everything is late already.
You will find my soul with no one in it.

There now, summer, no more sobbing. The rose in
That furrow will die but bloom and bloom again. 
    Verano
  Verano, ya me voy. Y me dan pena
las manitas sumisas de tus tardes.
Llegas devotamente; llegas viejo;
y ya no encontrarás en mi alma a nadie.
Verano! y pasarás por mis balcones
con gran rosario de amatistas y oros,
como un obispo triste que llegara
de lejos a buscar y bendecir
los rotos aros de unos muertos novios.
Verano, ya me voy. Allá, en setiembre
tengo una rosa que te encargo mucho;
la regarás de agua bendita todos
los días de pecado y de sepulcro.
Si a fuerza de llorar el mausoleo,
con luz de fe su mármol aletea,
levanta en alto tu responso, y pide
a Dios que siga para siempre muerta.
Todo ha de ser ya tarde;
y tú no encontrarás en mi alma a nadie.
Ya no llores, Verano! En aquel surco
muere una rosa que renace mucho. . . ","Summer, I am leaving. And there in September, you will find a rose I’ve left especially in your care, for you to tend to with holy water. The rose in the furrow will die but bloom and bloom again."
The Black Heralds,"Translated from the Spanish by Yvette Siegert
Some blows in life, they’re so heavy . . . I don’t know.
Blows as if dealt by God’s own wrath, as if, ahead,
the rip of every single thing we’d ever suffered
had pooled inside our souls . . . I don’t know.
These are few, but there they are . . . They carve
dark trenches in the toughest faces, the fiercest backs.
Perhaps they’re the racks of barbarous Attilas,
or else the black heralds that Death has sent us.
They’re the steep fall of some Christ from the soul,
of the laudable faith that Fate can make foul of.
Those bloodied blows are the sounds of bread
crackling in oven doors, turning to charcoal.
As for man . . . woe is he . . .  woe. He turns his gaze,
as if answering the call of a slap on the shoulder:
his expression is wild and all that he’s lived through
is settled, like penitent pools, in his eyes.
Some blows in life, they’re so heavy . . . I don’t know.
    Los heraldos negros
  Hay golpes en la vida, tan fuertes . . . Yo no sé!
Golpes como del odio de Dios; como si ante ellos,
la resaca de todo lo sufrido
se empozara en el alma . . . Yo no sé!
Son pocos, pero son. . .  Abren zanjas oscuras
en el rostro más fiero y en el lomo más fuerte.
Serán tal vez los potros de bárbaros atilas;
o los heraldos negros que nos manda la Muerte.
Son las caídas honda de los Cristos del alma,
de alguna fe adorable que el Destino blasfema.
Esos golpes sangrientos son las crepitaciones
de algún pan que en la Puerta del horno se nos quema.
Y el hombre. . .  Pobre . . .  pobre! Vuelve los ojos, como
cuando por sobre el hombre nos llama una palmada;
vuelve los ojos locos, y todo lo vivido
se empoza, como un charco de culpa, en la mirada.
Hay golpes en la vida, tan fuertes . . . Yo no sé!","Some blows in life, they’re so heavy . . . I don’t know. They carve dark trenches in the toughest faces, the fiercest backs. They’s the steep fall of some Christ from the soul, of the laudable faith that Fate can make foul of."

The Man Whose Pharynx Was Bad,"The time of year has grown indifferent.
Mildew of summer and the deepening snow
Are both alike in the routine I know.

Stirring no poet in his sleep, and tolls
The grand ideas of the villages.
The malady of the quotidian . . .
Perhaps, if summer ever came to rest
And lengthened, deepened, comforted, caressed
Through days like oceans in obsidian
Horizons full of night’s midsummer blaze;
Perhaps, if winter once could penetrate
Through all its purples to the final slate,
Persisting bleakly in an icy haze;
One might in turn become less diffident—
Out of such mildew plucking neater mould
And spouting new orations of the cold.

a green & blue medium-sized spotted body

Stop! Don’t kill it!

& the others joined in on the stomping
& I yelled stop! 
but no one would listen
& they stomped & stomped
& killed the frog 
& and it bled red
out of its eyes
out of its head
& it made me sad

but now he’s dead
& now we’ll never know”","After another mass shooting, my daughter tells me a modern day fairytale: “Luke killed a frog today’s at the playground” “I was the only one who yelled stop!”"

rush still interrupts the body I didn’t make, but keep breathing somehow
& functioning until I can’t, & the night before she died, I felt the easing of her spirit,

cousin I’m here—an echo of her mother’s absence, & we are left

from “Everything Shimmers”,"translated from the Danish by Susanna Nied
Then suddenly beech woods, all green behind the dozing eyes
a deer leaps across the forest road
scents of acid and moss and cheek against bark, sunrain
between trunks, I’m home and hear the Baltic Sea
crash against big rocks far away and I rest like a
fairy or a witch in the sweet smells of the forest floor
we can so easily forget what we are who we are
that we are, but it takes only a little call
to waken the sleepers, as now, in the forest, for
LISTEN, isn’t that song and the chiming of goblets
sounding in the green chambers? YES by golly, a celebration
for the child in his seventeenth year, who never has
been happier and never will be happier; the world shimmers
everything unimaginably possible while a handspring
and a new but not disturbing sensitivity have settled
in the middle of his irresistibly marzipanescent
body.
    Alting Blinker
  Så pludselig bøgeskov, helt grønt bag de blundende øjne
en hind springer over den stampede jordvej
her lugter af syre og mos og kinden mod bark, solregn
mellem stammer, jeg er hjemme og hører Østersøen
slå mod store sten langt borte er jeg hvilende som en
fe eller en heks i skovbundens dufte
vi kan så let glemme at vi er dem vi er
at vi er, men der skal bare et lille signal til
at vække den slumrende, som nu, i skoven, for
HØR NU er det ikke sang og bægerklang
der lyder i de grønne sale? JO, et gilde sørme
for barnet i sit syttende år, der aldrig har
haft det bedre og aldrig får det bedre; verden blinker
alting ufatteligt muligt mens et kraftspring
og en ny men ikke forstyrrende følsomhed har slået sig ned
midt i den uimodståeligt marcipanemmende
krop.","""Alting Blinker"" is a Danish children's book. The book is written by Danish author Susanna Nied. It was published in 2007 and has been translated from Danish."
Autumn Leaves,"Mother gave birth to me in the fall 
in the midst of grieving trees and withering leaves. 
Winter came home right after 
accompanied by winds of solitude. 
My earliest memories revolved around cold weather 
yet I remember meeting with summer  
before ever blowing my first candle. 
I saw these same trees shimmer in full bloom. 
I saw their branches clothed in vivid green. 
Early on,  
I learned not to shed a tear when autumn leaves 
for I know that summer comes home through the shiver. ","Mother gave birth to me in the fall, in the midst of grieving trees and withering leaves. Winter came home right after,accompanied by winds of solitude."
Temporary Shelters,"I know of men with holes  
who carry wounds  
and place them within wombs. 
They roam about,  
searching for security  
within a woman’s body. 
Because the only place  
they’ve ever felt at home  
was in their mother’s body.  
In longing for that same feeling,  
they search and search and search. 

These men, carry wounds  
and place them within wombs. 
Addicted to the warmth,  
they hope to find shelter within a stranger, 
only to come out feeling colder and emptier.  

The void is not gone. 
The bleeding is still on.  
Temporary shelters  
do not keep you warm forever. ",I know of men with holes who carry wounds and place them within wombs. The only place they’ve ever felt at home   was in their mother’s body.
Dove,"When we sought God, when we asked Him to come, 
when we opened the door and allowed Him in, when we 
washed our masks, when we humbled ourselves, 
destroying the walls we had created–to keep us from 
loving, hoping, aching and breaking. When we
showed Him the truest parts of ourselves, He began to feel 
comfortable in the rooms we had on lock. He began to 
clean them up–taking out the dirt that covered us with
shame. He arranged our broken vases and reframed our 
self-portrays. He began to own our homes, we began to 
feel clean, we began to feel pure. Once we allowed Him in, 
we began to heal.

To Mars from Arizona,"Saturday mornings were science fiction—
That is, on that day anything was possible.
We didn’t have to go to the movies for that,
Though when we did, we were introduced to ourselves
More than anything. Ourselves in rockets,
Ourselves taking chances, ourselves speaking to the universe.
Outside of the movies, we were still in them—
Our bikes were our rockets, our submarines, our jets.
But mostly, and first, our bikes were our horses 
In this childhood West, a loyal, red Western Flyer
Taking me everywhere, up and down, fast and slow.
Only later did I understand it was my own legs
That did it all. My own legs and my arms to steer,
My own small, mighty lungs to shout—
A shout that would later become a song.
When they weren’t horses, when my legs were tired,
When the shouts calmed down into just talking,
We bike-riders would sit, and find in that talking 
The gold we had been looking for, though we didn’t know it.
The gold was made of plans for Saturdays still to come—
We each had different ideas, but we all had them,
Speaking them confidently as if we were lions,
Deep-voiced and sure even in that quietude.
What would happen next was far away,
But even as we rested, something in us knew
We would catch the future no matter how fast it ran.","On that day anything was possible. Our bikes were our rockets, our submarines, our jets. The gold was made of plans for Saturdays still to come. We would catch the future no matter how fast it ran."

Planet Dread,"Dreadnought, I. Dread from the sea I was drawn, I

Dread the constellation I was born under, dread I
slept under, dread the waves of history, blustering red.

nursed me, dread she named me. Dread my girlhood
under sugar cane. Dread the hurricane. I was a child

could speak there was dread, before I could stumble.
Dread roamed the shore a ghostly spume, dreadless thread

to sea rise, to abyss. Dread my dead tooth unmaking
the veil, dread the ointment I, dread the wound I, dread the wail I,
dread the johncrow’s eye, smoke of black clouds heralding
only dread. Skirmish of youth, my constant banner of dread.
Dread at home, dread to the bone, my father dangling his guillotine
of dread. Dread as daily bread. Nursed dark by decades of dread,
teachers recoiled at my knotted thorns of dread. How the white
girls blanched with dread. Scorned for the hair on my head.
Beware my Blackheart of dread, the reckless haunt of my dread,
girl born of nothing but salt-air and dread. Girl who bore nothing
but a vision of dread. Such a savage, dread. Thrum of the natty dread.
Congo Bongo dread. Martyred was the dread. Brother still the dread.
Blood of my dread. Babylon maiming families of dread, pastors railing
against our dread, dread the crown of heavens I wear upon this head. Dread
at the root, dread of the fruit. Sister of dread. Daughter of the dread.

forbidden to rise,

Din of a dozen arcade games, but louder.

Last Judgment,"Terrified past panic, strict lines collapsed,
their shredded flesh more wound than flesh,
they play dead in a ditch, but won’t give up
their shrouds, which have grown on them.
Then the angels come, oiling eye sockets, joints,
and stuffing everyone’s armpits, left or right,
with an item they failed to desecrate in life.
This way, something saved remains warm,
and God’s hands don’t get cold, as He sorts
the good ones from the ones who’ve spoiled.","The angels come, oiling eye sockets, joints, and stuffing everyone’s armpits, left or right, with an item they failed to desecrate in life. Terrified past panic, strict lines collapsed, and shredded flesh more wound than flesh."
Electric Guitar,"for Patti Boyd
Hollow body, solid body, Archtop, Strat, or Flying V,
my shape’s a pitted avocado; a frying egg, yolk broken;
or nearly any Braque; my dark sounds utter hyperbole,
as in Eric’s bottleneck falsetto to his Layla—formerly
George’s something all too much—her gold ringlets
bloating Slowhand’s bell-bottom jeans with Blues.

Plenty other muses teased voltage from my pickups,
but the duende she awoke could play, until who knew
whether I fed back through her or she through me? ","Patti Boyd is an award-winning singer-songwriter. Boyd's music has been featured on CNN, PBS, and other networks. Boyd is also the author of the book, ""Patti Boyd: A Memoir"""
The Orchids,"translated from the Spanish by Alice Stone Blackwell
Freaks of bright crystal, airy beauties fair,
Whose enigmatic forms amaze the eye—
Crowns fit to deck Apollo’s brows on high,
Adornments meet for halls of splendor rare!
They spring from knots in tree-trunks, rising there
In sweet gradation; winding wondrously,
They twist their serpent stems, and far and nigh
Hang overhead like wingless birds in air.
Lonely, like pensive heads, all fetterless.
Lofty and free they bloom; by no dull chain
Their flowers to any tyrant root are bound;
Because they too, at war with pettiness,
Desire to live, like souls that know no stain,
Without one touch of contact with the ground.
    Las Orquídeas
     Caprichos de cristal, airosas galas
de enigmáticas formas sorprendentes,
diademas propias de apolíneas frentes,
adornos dignos de fastuosas salas.
   En los nudos de un tronco hacen escalas;
y ensortijan sus tallos de serpientes,
hasta quedar en la altitud pendientes,
á manera de pájaros sin alas.
   Tristes como cabezas pensativas,
brotan ellas, sin torpes ligaduras
de tirana raíz, libres y altivas;
   porque también, con lo mezquino en guerra,
quieren vivir, como las almas puras,
sin un solo contacto con la tierra . . .",The poem was written in Spanish and published in the early 1900s. It was translated from the Spanish by Alice Stone Blackwell. The poem is called “Las Orquídeas’’.
Oakland in Rain,"Years before ever seeing California, I wrote a story titled “Oakland in Rain.” 
Rain served as an easy metaphor for the unexpected in a place 
known for abundance, and it provided a texture of melancholy. 
The nameless protagonist—an exiled drunk who was, 
of course, a thinly veiled version of myself— 
had lost her mind and believed the weather communicated with her: 
rain meant soberness, that she had been absolved of some sort of punishment. 
Plagued by her wild inner life, I imagined her wandering the city, 
intent on getting lost in the Catholic cemeteries, where she took note  
of lemons in the wet grass (an offering?), the sky, a hawk on a tree. 
But no matter where she went, nothing was ever quiet enough. 
Despite my best efforts, the narrative was bleak; 
it lacked tension and a convincing resolution. 
Now, why am I telling you all this? Well, one day I woke up 
and it had been raining in the Oakland of my actual life. 
Outside my window, the cottonwood trees looked like the day before, 
but drops of water covered the few dead leaves that hadn’t fallen 
all the way down and were caught between branches. 
It felt foolish to consider my fate, the idea of premonition. 
Still, I put on my red coat and walked up the hill to the cemetery. 
As if I had invented it, there were lemons in the grass, palm trees 
with browned leaves. Walking there, between the gravestones of strangers, 
a runner passed me, and a family who had come to bring flowers, 
their faces animated, ruddy from the cold. And my life, I understood,  
was just like their lives—marked by ordinary rituals, exercise,  
and theories about the body. Nothing was as opulent as I had imagined it 
back then, but just as I had needed it—the meaning of it all cold  
and very still, like a marble pedestal engraved with an ancient, simple fact.",The author wrote a story titled “Oakland in Rain.” The protagonist was an exiled drunk who believed the weather communicated with her. The story was bleak and lacked tension and a convincing resolution.
Fugal,"A shriek, dawn-like, birdless—an ordained
stratum—pulsing canticle of the numen. 
The chant coarsely flung at the bosky ridges 
of shattered clavicle—skull doused in lacquer. 
Hear into the negative of bone the annals of a hut,
lamina of guttural gowk. 
                                        Fluted brinks of obsidian 
cloaked dimly in canon—clamor, mist, shaping the glum 
worship. The rite of splay—to utter a corpse to dazzle—
entombing the nebulous flesh in funerary hum, a syllabic urn.",The chant coarsely flung at the bosky ridges of shattered clavicle. The rite of splay—to utter a corpse to dazzle. The nebulous flesh in funerary hum.

Balmy breezes softly sighing,
     Kiss the light waves as they curl;
And the sun, albeit dying

And the willow never misses

In the dark corner of the drawing-room,
     Forgotten by its mistress long ago,
Silent, cover’d with dust there in the gloom

How many notes slept in those strings half-dead
     And waited for her fingers, white as snow.
To wake them into throbbing life, that fled
          Away in sighs!
Ah me! thought I, how oft sleeps genius thus
     Deep in the soul, hoping eternally
A voice will say, as He to Lazarus,
          “Arise and walk.”—Ah me!","In the dark corner of the drawing-room, a harp lies. Forgotten by its mistress long ago, the harp waits for her fingers to wake it up."

Flying arrow that darts astray,
   Shot at misfortune unforeseen,
   Without divining where its keen
Quivering edge will find its way;
Leaf that from the sapless tree
   Is ravished by the wild south wind,
   With none to know or care to find
The furrow where its end will be;
Gigantic wave,—which the tempest hurls
   And fiercely tosses upon the sea—
   That rolling and raging wantonly
Knows not the shore towards which it whirls;
Light that shines though death be nigh
   And burns in flickering circles small,
   Not knowing which among them all
Will flicker the last and trembling die;
Such am I. By chance I flow
   Into this troubled world unsought;
   I ebb away without a thought
Of whence I come or where I go.",The poem was written in Spanish by Mason Carnes. It is about an arrow that is shot at misfortune unforeseen. The author does not know where the arrow will end up.

Over you at dead of night,

Throbbing in a sweet unrest

And the reflex of a smile
Darts, illumining your lips;
Then to read upon your brow
Silent thoughts, that pass like clouds
O’er a glass, I’d give, my soul,
All I wish—fame, genius, gold!
When words die upon your lips,
And your breath comes quick and warm,
And your cheeks are all aglow
And your black eyes look in mine;
Then to see in them a spark,
Flashing with a humid fire,
As it gushes from the heart,
I would give, soul of my soul,
All that is and all to come!","The song was written in Spanish and has been translated from the Spanish by Mason Carnes. The lyrics include the words: ""O’er a glass, I’d give, my soul, all I wish—fame, genius, gold!"""

Two blood-red tongues of fire
That, circling the same log,
Approach and as they kiss
Form but a single flame;
Two notes, plucked cunningly
Together from the lute,
That meet in space in sweet
Harmonious embrace;
Two waves that come to die
Together on the beach
And, as they’re breaking, crown
Themselves with silver crest;
Two sinuous curls of smoke
That rise from out the lake
And, as they meet there in
The sky, form one white cloud;
Two thoughts that equally
Gush out; two kisses blent;
Two echoes mingling e’er,—
Like these are our two souls!","Two blood-red tongues of fire                Form but a single flame;                Two notes, plucked cunningly                Together from the lute,                That meet in space in sweet                Harmonious embrace.                Two waves that come to die                Together on the beach                And, as they’re breaking, crown                Themselves with silver crest;                 Two sinuous curls of smoke                That rise from out the lake                As they meet there in                The sky, form one white cloud;    Two thoughts that equally"

If, when the bell-flow’rs on your balcony
              All trembling line,
You think it is the sighing, murmuring wind
              That passes by,
Know that, hidden among the green leaves there,
              For you I sigh.
If, when behind you echoing on your ear

You think some far-off voice has called you, know

Of evening shadows that surround you, love,

When the sleepless fever comes
And the hours creep slowly by,
On the border of my bed
      Who will sit beside me?
When my thin and trembling hand
I stretch out—about to die—
Longing for a friendly hand,
      Who will grasp it tightly?
When my eyes are glazed by death
Eyes that ne’er again will see—
Should my eyelids open stay,
      Who will close them kindly? 
When they sound the funeral bell
(If a knell be tolled for me),
Hearing it, a gentle prayer
      Who will murmur softly?
When my body lies at rest
In the bosom of the earth,
O’er the soon-forgotten grave
      Who will come to mourn me?
When the sun returns to shine
On the morrow, in their mirth
That I passed once through this world

To Leonora,"translated from the Spanish by Alice Stone Blackwell
Black as the wing of Mystery thine hair,
Dark as a “Never” where deep sorrow lies,
As a farewell, or as the words “Who knows?”
Yet is there something darker still—thine eyes!
Two musing wizards are those eyes of thine;
Sphinxes asleep in shadow in the South;
Two beautiful enigmas, wondrous fair;
Yet is there something fairer still—thy mouth!
Thy mouth! Ah, yes! Thy mouth, divinely formed
For love’s expression and to be love’s goal,
Shaped for love’s warm communion—thy young mouth! 
Yet is there something better still—thy soul.
Thy soul, retiring, silent, brimming o’er 
With pity and with tenderness, I deem
Deep as the ocean, the unsounded sea; 
Yet is there something deeper still—thy dream!

Wave of light and kiss of breeze,—

Is it true that from its prison

Mounts into the spaceless ether,

    With no earthly fetters fraught,
For a while goes freely roaming

Juggler,"Translated from the Filipino by Kristine Ong Muslim
Swapping seven balls with his palm,
and with air. Precision inhabits the gap
between the ball’s trajectory and its anticipated
pace at the brink of hesitation—
the arc of descent. How does one grasp making
sense of timing when to hurl and when to catch?
Is it when one rehearses alone or when one rehearses
being alone? Which one holds
when there is no break from motion,
and from emotion? They thought, he makes gravity.
Then in a blink of an eye, oh! the balls are dropped.
They have yet to stop holding their breath.

Early Instance,"Once, the violin maker bent
so close and for so long to beauty
he almost saw the saw as it ravished his hand.
But now, his three fingers light up her face
—here-, here-here-here—
amid the forest of primitive instruments
—horn and crumhorn, lute and three-holed flute—
branching from hooks along the walls
of his one room.
This maker makes her sad.
Or good. Or safe. Or steady.
Or briefly steadfast in his birdfoot hand.
And after, since she asks, 
he plays one of his fiddles for her,
tucking it under his right ear,
bowing with what is left of his left hand,
letting the joyful spider the right fingers make
loose to spell and spell the thing she still can feel…
But not till decades later will she sense herself as music.
And what will bring her to it will be a need for solace 
beyond the human kind.","Once, the violin maker bent so close and for so long to beauty that she almost saw the saw as it ravished his hand. But now, his three fingers light up her face as he plays one of his fiddles."

I Have No Answer But Stones,"Who will walk / Between me and the crying of the frogs?
—Edna St. Vincent Millay

Either you believe, or you don’t, my friend says. Which is it?
We’re parked on the dirt road in darkness, beer bottles balanced

on the hood of her truck. It’s Passover, and I’m speaking in stories again,
counting them out like drops of wine on a white serving plate:

one for blood, two for frogs. In the bog below the hill the peepers
weave a net of their shrieking; they cinch the night’s throat taut.

How to say I believe most in the power of what I do not know,
secondly in the power of that which I can hold in a closed fist?

We collect stones from the road by headlamp. My friend likes
purple ones best. This is how I learned to carry stories, to tuck them

into my pocket, familiar weight chafing my thigh—
what my ancestors must have carried, shuffling toward exile.

A story pressed onto a child’s tongue is not the same as bread,
but it will suffice for a time. Before me a woman bends under her bundle.

From the bundle a thin string of rice keeps pouring over the street…
I think of nothing, wrote fourteen-year-old Yitzchak Rudashevski in his diary

the day the Jews were herded from Vilna. What does one haul with
a body that doesn’t know its own ghosts? If the stories clink like stones

at the bottom of my empty sack, they give me a rhythm to walk by.
If they rattle bones or doorknobs on nights as dark as this one,

I know I’ll let them in. Listen, I tell my friend, then stop.
I have no answer. I drink more beer. I load my pockets with more

and larger stones. Each year the frogs shrill a tower of glass
to the top of the sky. Each year they scream until it shatters us.","Edna St. Vincent Millay is a best-selling author. She is best known for her work on the Holocaust. In a new book, she shares some of her stories."
What Will You Do at the End of the World?,"When I watch the video where the violinist plays
as surgeons cut the cancer from her brain,
my first impulse is to descend into metaphor—
to imagine the plaintive cry of her violin as a singular
silvery thread that leads the surgeons—sublimely,
tremulously—through the Minotaur’s maze,
so they can extract the tumor abutting the lobe
that controls her left hand, so they can navigate
the fleshy labyrinthine folds and electric shocks
that make a human mind. When I watch her bow
graze the ventilator tube again and again,
I want to recall the old story of Nero playing
as Rome burned, which is supposed to be a story
about callous cruelty and ineffectual leadership,
but which fails to hold up under historic scrutiny
for many reasons, including that the violin
was not invented until the 11th century.
Still, the fable lends him more humanity than not—
the notion that there was music inside him,
even if it took six days of burning to fan it out,
a music so powerful it forced itself to escape
his tyrant’s mouth. If art is only pleasure,
Nero’s act is selfish, loathsome, but if art is survival—
a violin’s siren might morph to beacon
against the smoky air. I keep asking my poems
what the world needs from me in these days
of quickening dread, of burgeoning conflagration,
what they want me to do. In the comments section
below the hospital video, no one can agree
on what they’re seeing: Creepy, incredible,
horrifying, beautiful. Afterward, the violinist recalls,
I kept thinking, Get out of my way. I need to play louder.","The violinist plays as surgeons cut the cancer from her brain. When I watch her bowgraze the ventilator tube again and again, I want to recall the old story of Nero playing music as Rome burned. If art is only pleasure, Nero’s act is selfish, loathsome, but if art is survival, a violin’'s siren might morph to beacon against the smoky air."
Elegy for My Grandmother in the Form of a Cactus,"The way each linked lobe of your cactus swallows all
the green from the one before it, reminds me of that movie
about the human centipede and how appalled you’d have been
to know such a film exists, though you were no stranger
to the macabre, you who used to warn me not to drink tea
too much or my stomach would swell red, you said,
citing the story of that man with the shotgun wound
in his abdomen, how he became a medical curiosity
for the dark deep hole in him through which the world
could suddenly view the innermost sanctum of a human body,
which was a long way you had of saying it matters what we put
inside ourselves. I have put so many things inside myself I should
not have: smoke of all sorts, whiskey, sorrow, pennies, bottomless
guilt, river stones, a crusty work glove pulled off with my teeth.
I even licked a Burmese python once. I list the contraband
of my body to myself as I eat nachos or frozen French fries
off your blue dinner plates, counting the indulgences
I imagine you would not have approved. And here I am now,
inserting a gross horror movie reference into a poem
about your absence, a poem I began writing only because
I wanted you to know: your cactus is flowering again,
as it has four years now, fuchsia flames licking out
from the maw of each final green—I don’t know what to call it,
not a leaf, but a section of stem pressed flat—until yes,
it erupts into firework, a tongue or tail of brightness uncurling
into this winter room. I wanted you to know: it flowered
the night you died. It flowered because I told it to,
you in your hospital bed and me not there. And now
I force it unconsciously each year, forget to water
for months then soak it with the thawed remains
of yesterday’s chicken pail. It’s an Easter cactus really,
I wanted you to know. I looked it up on a diagram today—
the three shapes of lobe—but yours is willful, peculiar, blooms
only in late January, blooms only for you. Which is fitting,
since we don’t believe in resurrection, you or I. Just another
flattened green segment each year, another stubborn
explosion of beauty at the end of our grief.","""I wanted you to know: your cactus is flowering again,"" writes poet. ""I force it unconsciously each year, forget to water it for months then soak it with the thawed remains of yesterday's chicken pail"""

South Side (V),"To those who come after, this is the law of the town—
the South Side is not a place, but a state of being,
a song, the candy lady circling around
the blocks with walking tacos, Kool-Aid unfreezing
in Styrofoam cups. Happiness costs so little
for those who are willing to buy. And everyone
has a name; the man who drives the ice-cream truck, the nickel-
and-dime bag boys with Frootie Rolls lining one
side of their jackets’ insides—Mr. Bradley,
Joshua ’nem, their presence steady as statues.
How much of this city is flavor? The thick and sappy
taste of too sweet, too quick to melt, the cashew
crunch of Garrett popcorn mix? It’s sensory;
the act of remembering, of making memory.","The South Side is not a place, but a state of being. The candy lady circling around the blocks with walking tacos, Kool-Aid unfurled in Styrofoam cups."
Tender-Headed,"I resume my Saturday night post
between stretchmarks,
shoulders caught between chestnut
thighs as Grandma greases my scalp.
She carmines the nape of my neck
with her rattail comb, the one
with gaps where my naps
wrestled and won.
The coffee table muddles with jars
of gel and rubber bands that welted
her thumbs when they snapped,
my backside numb on the living room
carpet, dahlia fibers honeycombing
my skin through my oversized tee.
Be still now, and I strain
against her grip on my roots,
chawing tongue to check my
mewls, focusing on the click
of her short nails colliding
as she plaits piece over piece.
She hums “For Your Glory,”
parts my hair into sections,
gridding out old city streets
and rows of cotton;
I wonder if she braids my hair
for the pastor’s approval
or God’s—they’d never say.","Grandma greases my scalp with her rattail comb. She hums “For Your Glory,” and plaits my hair into sections. I wonder if she braids my hair for the pastor’s approval."

Tropical Town,"For Miss Eugenia L. V. Geisenheimer
Blue, pink, and yellow houses, and, afar,
The cemetery, where the green trees are.
Sometimes you see a hungry dog pass by,
And there are always buzzards in the sky.
Sometimes you hear the big cathedral bell,
A blindman rings it; and sometimes you hear
A rumbling ox-cart that brings wood to sell.
Else nothing ever breaks the ancient spell
That holds the town asleep, save, once a year,
The Easter festival . . .
                                                I come from there,
And when I tire of hoping, and despair
Is heavy over me, my thoughts go far,
Beyond that length of lazy street, to where 
The lonely green trees and the white graves are.","The cemetery, where the green trees are. The lonely green trees and the white graves are. A blindman rings the cathedral bell; and sometimes you hear a rumbling ox-cart that brings wood to sell."
Home,"I awaken to the sound of a rooster crowing,
the smell of fresh-brewed coffee.
I flash
back to my childhood. I am in the same
house. The same feelings flood
over me, take me back sixty years.
The Last Supper on the wall
Grandkids smile from the refrigerator door.
The house is still the same house.
At this table, the same table, in this kitchen,
I cut my quinceañera cake.
At this table in this house, the same house,
we sat talking after my father’s death,
after Bueli’s death,
after Tino’s death, and
before
important events—
weddings, births, trips.
The legs of the table sustain us still.
Furniture is necessary context
for life in and out of doors.
Pat the windowsill.
Cry a tear of joy or sadness
in this house. The same house.
The very same house.
Our home.","The house is still the same house. I awaken to the sound of a rooster crowing, the smell of fresh-brewed coffee. At this table, the same table, in this kitchen, I cut my quinceañera cake."
Bullfight,"I am the bull dragged
across a sandy bullring in Cancún,
a carcass, spent and bled to death.
The tourists—Japanese, German, Chicano, and even gringos—
don’t know they just witnessed a travesty, they cheer
a gutted ritual. No honor. No glory.
I gave my life for this?
When I was poked and raced into the ring,
I moved just so,
escaped the ribbon marker.
“Saltillero” me nombraron,
a worthy name, an honorable name.
Puny men tease me,
poke and try to anger me.
They fail.
The banderillero, big as a bull,
rides a horse, poor beast of burden;
pokes and fails.
The sharp knife enters swiftly,
and I know what’s coming. Feel it
as sure as I breathe,
with nostrils wide, huffing.
I see dark pink—the matador’s cape,
      shiny sequins in black and white.
I am color-blind, you say.
So I’ve heard, but I assure you I hear the color,
smell the red of blood and the brown of sun-bronzed skin.
Movement I must follow;
perplexed and tired, I sniff the earth,
following my scent
to the source of death.
He bends, and I hear, “Olé.”
I flick an ear,
the right, then the left;
I flick my tail.
I stand calmly,
appear not interested,
then I follow through
to my imminent end.
The crowd roars and stands;
I lie and die
on a Wednesday afternoon
en Cancún.
Red with beer and sun,
the tourists cheer
amid the stench of blood and sweat.
It’s five o’clock
on a Wednesday in Cancún.
I die.","I am the bull dragged across a sandy bullring in Cancún, spent and bled to death. The tourists don’t know they just witnessed a travesty, they cheer a gutted ritual. I gave my life for this?"
Cunning,"Translated from the Spanish by the author
To Santa Elena
Cunningly you embroiled me
in your tangled life.
Your legend follows me from Spain.
The Jews and the Gypsies,
those of good and evil.
You follow me to Laredo and the matachines
dancing to a cross bedecked with flowers,
la cruz verdadera que tú
encontraste a tu manera.
No te dejaste engañar.
¡Tú sabias la verdad!
Ay Elena, such cleverness!
You arrived at this my town
of sunny afternoons with unexpected rain showers
on the Day of the Holy Cross
in Laredo al barrio de la Ladrillera.
The drum me llama
y el corazón responde.
    Astucia
  A Santa Elena
Con que astucia
me enredaste in your enmarañada vida
y tu leyenda me sigue desde España
y los judíos, los gitanos,
las gentes de bien y de mal,
hasta Laredo y matachines
danzando a la cruz vestida de flores,

found. You wouldn’t let anyone
fool you.

What I Am In My Kitchen,"Yeast rises from nonna’s breadboard
under palm heels coaxing dough. I think mince and mash,
sauté and stew, sift and fold, spatulas and spoons. 
Knives, dependable as good clocks, 
ease through fish and eggs, chop onions
into dice, peppers into rings, meat into slices.

With metal-laced whips, I coax
snowy mounds, foam and froth;
butter and cream evolve into peaks.
Sprinkle and dash, tad and cup, a smidgen, 
I grate and grind, zing zest in air, flip and sift, 
know roux from glaze or simmer.
Ribbons of basil and thyme, snips of rosemary 
slip into sauces with solid support from parsley 
unleashed into the marriage of oil and garlic, 
marination of tarragon and vinegar.  I know
food’s language, the way dill tucks itself
so well into humus, sour cream, or salad,
the ménage of rosemary, sage and savory; cinnamon, 
clove and nutmeg; how hands find their way,
unafraid of cardamom and coriander, fennel and bay. 
I remember mother’s sauces, meringues, melt 
of her teacakes; nonna and her pots, heavy 
and true, her dice of avocado and artichoke 
in salads, her palm measuring salt,  
its immutable truth, its briny clip 
in the mouth, its promise to preserve.  ","With metal-laced whips, I coaxssnowy mounds, foam and froth. I grate and grind, zing zest in air, flip and sift. I know roux from glaze or simmer. I remember mother’s sauces, meringues and teacakes."
Doppelgänger,"Translated from the Spanish by Roque Raquel Salas Rivera
I did not come to solitude
she packed my suitcase and said go.
She put an egg in my suitcase
she put leavening in my suitcase
she put salt in my suitcase
flour, sugar, and warm water.
I came to my mother’s house to sleep for days.
I closed all the doors.
I took off my clothes, my watches.
I left the suitcase on the floor unopened.
Now hungry,
with my eyes I rummage through the things I brought.
They have taken everything.
All that’s left is the egg, there, intact
beside the bed
and, when facing the mirror,
I feel strangely committed to its care.
    Doppelgänger
  No vine a la soledad
ella empacó mi maleta y dijo vete.
Puso un huevo en mi maleta
puso levadura en mi maleta
puso sal en mi maleta
harina, azúcar y agua tibia.
Vine a casa de mi madre a dormir días.
Cerré todas las puertas.
Me quité la ropa y los relojes.
Dejé la maleta sobre el suelo sin abrirla.
Ahora hambriento
rebusco con los ojos lo que traje.
Se han llevado todo.
Queda sólo el huevo, ahí, intacto
a un lado de la cama
y siento ante el espejo
el compromiso raro de cuidarlo.","Roque Raquel Salas Rivera writes that she packed her suitcase and went to her mother's house to sleep for days. When facing the mirror, she says she feels strangely committed to its care."
In a Season of Absence,"We plowed under the familiar
with the blackened basil leaves.
Now abandoned recipes wait
on the counter. Here is the absence
of cinnamon and sage, biscotti
and wine. Shadows settle
into empty chairs around this table
where no candlesticks soften
the room. Plants sent to hold us up
crowd this space. In the peace plant,
a cobra arches its hooded head.
The single gardenia lifts its odor
to everything unanswered. Night
is silent, except the echo of a seed
in its hollow pod. We stare
through the window, trolling
an empty sky, black as the earth
our feet tamped back into place.
Stars do not feed the masses.
The wilderness has found us out.
Darkness widens our pupils.","The wilderness has found us out. We plowed under the familiar with the blackened basil leaves. The single gardenia lifts its odor to everything unanswered. Night is silent, except the echo of a seed in its hollow pod."
Owls,"—after Charles Baudelaire, “Les Hiboux”
In black yew shelters,
Owls tuck themselves away,
Strange gods
With red meditating shifty eyes,
Otherwise roost unstirring
Till the melancholy hour
When darkness shovels
The sun offstage.

Thus, they teach the sage
She need fear in this world
Only tumult and action.

Passing, drunk on shadows,
My punishment for desiring change
Is desiring more change.",Charles Baudelaire’s ‘Les Hiboux’ is one of the most famous works of French literature. The book is about a young woman who wants to change the world. It is written in French.
Hands,"Of a thousand hands
I’d know my father’s,
long fingers shaped like oars,
the index scar,
the flat, grooved nails,
hands that fixed the doll’s arm,
mended Whisker’s ear, checked homework.
Those hands grated romano over Sunday pasta,
curled around glasses of wine
he toasted with at dinner,
or opened to offer the sweetest mulberries,
the ripest figs from his trees.

Once he kept a parsley caterpillar
so I could watch it emerge from its cocoon.
The jar was too small, though;
the wings dried with a crease.
It walked the long ramp of my father’s hand,
off balance at takeoff.
It fanned and fanned,
but the crease would not unfold,
the wings could not lift.
My father set it in the grass,
and we watched it walk
the short runway of its life,
a tiny lopsided glider without wind.
My father’s hands, like long anchors,
dangled at his sides.","Of a thousand hands                I’d know my father’s,                long fingers shaped like oars,                the index scar.                Those hands grated romano over Sunday pasta,                curled around glasses of wine                he toasted with at dinner, or opened to offer the sweetest mulberries.                Once he kept a parsley caterpillar                so I could watch it emerge from its cocoon."
Lost in the Snow,"We have circled the area for hours, unsure
where we are on the map, and when we are sure,
not sure how to get where we’re going to view
cathedrals and broken marbles in alcoves, and it’s
snowing, flakes laying a little carpet around us as we
search for a way out, a way back into a clearing while
one of us keeps looking at a map as we single-file
down narrow streets leaving a snow trail and see
a train station where we can board as soon as we
figure out where it will take us while the snow
falls and keeps falling and icing the tracks, engines
struggling and wheezing, a distant whistle, wind
swirling snow, and snow covering benches, and sky
is paper, a few birds scratching marks, one leaving
hieroglyphs on the ground beside us as we look
at the map and see nothing we know but know
that some time before long we’ll be somewhere
we want to go as the snow keeps falling and falling.","The snow keeps falling and falling. We have circled the area for hours, unsure where we are on the map. We are not sure how to get where we’re going, and it’s snowing."
Transit,"(for Emily)
At the museum of old trains,
the ever-rusting graveyard bound
by a living stream and a heavy
humid drapery of weeds hung from pines,
you in slim black mourning dress and boots
pick your way among the rubble
of metal bones and tracks, then stop to pose
on the fourth step of a wooden stairs
disjoined from what it belonged to,
and turn your head this way and that,
spilling sunlit hair down one shoulder
then the other.","At the museum of old trains, the ever-rusting graveyard bound by a living stream and a heavy humid drapery of weeds hung from pines. (for Emily)"

of napkins wedged
between the ices,

dresses dancing
up the street, leaving
her at the curb
in flipflops and sweatshorts
looking through the car window

Kissinger at the Louvre (Three Drafts),"             1
Kissinger in black-tie shuffles to the town car
idling at the museum complex edge
between where the glum Pei pyramid rises
and the gardens begin. “Is that—” I say,
and “Yes,” says Jim, baby in his arms,
me shoving the empty stroller to get home
by naptime. Nobody notices, clicking
at each other through camera phones, Kissinger
looking matchlessly neat, clean, ugly and
dressed by servants. His driver’s at the door,
arms stretched wide as in a fish-this-big tall tale
in welcome. The ear-wired bodyguard,
hand on Kissinger’s gray-fur head so it won’t
scrape the door-frame, bends him into the car.
If I were a different kind of poet, I’d put
Kissinger in front of The Raft of the Medusa
blinking at the father weeping for his son
lying dead over his lap as the sails
of the ship that will rescue them are
sighted on the horizon and the top man
in the spout of survivors waves his ragged
undershirt. Or I’d put him gazing reflectively
at The Death of Sardanapalus, a Potentate
presiding amid an exorbitance of fabrics
over his imminent suicide by fire,
slaves bringing in, in order of importance,
horses, gems, plate and favored concubines
for slaughter. I’m not that kind of poet.
             2
Kissinger totters befuddled by culpability,
luncheon champagne and dotage. The car
eats him. I won’t pretend the bodyguard’s
Vietnamese or Cambodian, though that’s
the obvious truth-in-lies move—he’s French,
that ratface-handsome, smoked-out look—
and doesn’t care merde for history. He makes
the old man bow, same move with which
the beat cop, our public servant, submits
the petty criminal to the patrol car,
same move the anguished teenager got—
half-protective, half-corrective or coercive,
half-kind—after the arraignment for leaving
her newborn to die in a rest stop dumpster.
Anybody can understand the girl, and even
the purse-snatcher. Bodyguard bends Kissinger
gently in, portly little Kissinger, gloves his head—
anything hurt will be the hand of the servant.
Ecru upholstery with oxblood accents, minibar
something like a safe, CNN muted to newscrawl
and the anchor’s frozen-flesh face. The latest assistant,
gender irrelevant, busy with a BlackBerry across from him,
root beer-colored eyes and preternaturally neat hair
of La belle ferronière, keeps the lap desk, emergency
Magic Wand Stain Remover Stick, eyebrow brush
and dossier of Opinions in what looks like
“the football”—the nuclear war plan suitcase
Presidential aides carry at all times—but isn’t.
             3
The one camera flash as he got in
gave Kissinger a headache. As they start
for his Avenue du President Wilson hotel,
the Rue de Rivoli sliding by in a haze,
he falls uncomfortably asleep to the anodyne
glow and murmur (“tournez à gauche”) of the driver’s
GPS device. The relieved assistant
opens an Imagist anthology. In Osaka, Oslo or Wasilla,
Alaska some weeks later, a woman at her kitchen table
uploads Paris vacation photos to her laptop.
“Who’s that behind me?” A dark figure. “He looks familiar.”
“How should I know,” says her husband.
“I’m trying to get Baby to eat more potato.”
“Oh well. I look fat in it,” she says. And deletes.","The author recalls a visit to Paris with President George W. Henry Kissinger and his bodyguard were taken to the town car by a photographer. The photographer snapped Kissinger looking matchlessly neat, clean, ugly and dressed by servants."
Banding,"The nets of God hang in every wild place
to catch the unwary migrant, one with the skull
still soft, the journey barely started,
another to fall from the sky on the ten thousandth mile,

but when he holds one of those small, terrified
bodies like a jewel between his thumb and forefinger
and unfans the wing to measure it, secretly admiring
the bars he conceived to catch his own hungry eye,
and the little claw foot he rings with a coded band
that numbers the feathers and weds him forever
to the pulse in his palm that recalls his own heaving heart
the day he flew into a net and hung there thirsting
in the woods where only a wasp moved, flicking cobalt wings—

when he lets go, when he flings what he has marked
into emptiness, he follows the speck with his eye
to South America and farther, to white unmapped fields
known intimately in the mind of one who flies.","The nets of God hang in every wild place                to catch the unwary migrant, one with the skull still soft, the journey barely started, and another to fall from the sky on the ten thousandth mile."
My Brother is Getting Arrested Again,"My brother is getting arrested again.
What does he want? What does he know?
We can’t talk politics. He doesn’t have politics.
I’m helpless with him.

My brother is getting arrested again.
He is not weeding community gardens.
He is not climbing on roofs to bang
with hammer on shingles, admire
his arm-hairs going gold in the sun.

My brother is getting arrested again.

My mother makes sarcastic remarks
and bails him out.
They can’t talk politics.
She’s helpless with him.

He pushes hard at a sawhorse barricade,
black bandana up over his nose.
He shouts this is what democracy looks like.

My brother is getting arrested again.

He’s not lending a hand at needle exchanges.
Not fishing from pier’s end with his best buddy, Dad.
He might be facing the incoming clouds.

He’s not wearing pinstripes, seersucker, wingtips,
not dressing down for casual Friday. He doesn’t care
about the future of Krispy Kreme stock.

My father clears his throat. He says “being pro-Palestinian
is anti-Semitic.” They can’t talk politics.
My father is helpless with him.
The barricade breaks,
the yellow do-not-cross crossbeam
smacks to the ground.
My little sister says, snippily, “I agree with him—
in principle.” They don’t talk politics.
She’s helpless with him.

My brother is getting arrested again.

A sudden melee, my brother disappearing.
He sucks in others like a star imploding.

He’s down, he’s lifted away,
wrists latched behind his back.

Now he stinks from the heat on the prison bus.
Now he’s stuffed in a holding cell with eight other protesters.
Now they take apart the sandwiches they get in jail.
They eat the bread—they toss
the orange limp cheese square at the wall.
It sticks. Collaborative chem-processed
chance-operation artwork. It’s a whale!
It’s the mayor! It’s the moon!
No sleep for three days and three nights,

Ode to People Who Hate Me,"I hate being hated even though I 
provoke it, not by committing major wrongs 
like murder, more like a regular 
pattern of being selfish or forgetful, 
which is another word for selfish. 
If you hate me, trust me I know—
in fact, I have a ledger of people, like you, 
who hate me, and I rifle through it every 
morning obsessing over the names more 
than they think about mine—a passing 
thought, a microsecond of dislike or worse, 
indifference like the Godzilla rays of fire 
I feel buzz out of your eyes when 
you scroll past my pictures on Instagram. 
I should focus on the people who love me,
every therapist I ever had has told me so, 
but I don’t need them to love me more, 
so that’s pointless. If we hate each other, 
I assure you my hate has a trace of love 
with a dash of hope. It’s the throbbing 
contradiction of hate’s dark thrall. ","I hate being hated even though I provoke it, not by committing major wrongs  like murder, more like a regular pattern of being selfish or forgetful.

Inner,"“Our psyches resemble the bordertowns [. . .]. Nothing happens in the ‘real’ world unless it first happens in the images in our heads.”
            —Gloria Anzaldúa, “Towards a New Consciousness,” Borderlands/La Frontera
You wrote of communal ground, prepare  
beyond culture to unite us. All to hold us, in 
bind, Gloria. Awareness of situation before inner  
change. Inner change before societal change. I do  
not mistake this for an equation. To develop  
unencumbered, we must understand our own 
split: from history, from language, from each of our faces— 
the situation: intentionality behind the dominant
white culture’s thoughts & actions to cull us. Realness  
of our fabrication of real. Pock holes in the real to remake
the real. If we ask the llama to explain their relationship  
to the heard. Silence. Someone thinks sumpter animal. 
Someone thinks beast of burden. In the high alpines 
of the Andes, the cousin vicuña moves at night among 
steep slopes & festuca, continues to resist domestication. 
Ask the vicuña, Who do you serve? Silence. Someone 
mistakes the lack of sound for acquiescence. Someone  
labels a wild thing sacred. Someone labels a wild thing 
dangerous. Someone doesn’t like the use of animal 
or thing associated with their personhood. Someone
wants more animality, less human. Collapse the word 
human into its embodied history of colonized with-
holding meant to deteriorate a body not white. I label 
myself animal. Reach knuckles & wrists inside my throat 
to pull & gather all the gutturals within my tissues. I wonder who 
labels me dangerous now. A word is a bordertown. Belief in 
vocabulary means we carve ourselves out of plurality. Town  
before the town. & the outer terrains sculpt from the inner  
terrains & a mouth held shut still resides in a cerebrum firing— 
thinking & voluntary muscles controlled by the same organ. ","Gloria Anzaldúa’s “Towards a New Consciousness” is published by Borderlands/La Frontera. To develop, we must understand our own “split: from history, from language, from each of our faces”"

The Palace-Burner,"A picture in a newspaper
She has been burning palaces. “To see
     The sparks look pretty in the wind?” Well, yes—
And something more. But women brave as she
     Leave much for cowards, such as I, to guess.
But this is old, so old that everything
     Is ashes here—the woman and the rest.
Two years are—oh! so long. Now you may bring
     Some newer pictures. You like this one best?
You wish that you had lived in Paris then?
     You would have loved to burn a palace, too?
But they had guns in France, and Christian men
     Shot wicked little Communists like you.
You would have burned the palace?—Just because
     You did not live in it yourself! Oh! why
Have I not taught you to respect the laws?
     You would have burned the palace—would not I?
Would I? Go to your play. Would I, indeed?
     I? Does the boy not know my soul to be
Languid and worldly, with a dainty need
     For light and music? Yet he questions me.
Can he have seen my soul more near than I?
     Ah! in the dusk and distance sweet she seems,
With lips to kiss away a baby’s cry,
     Hands fit for flowers, and eyes for tears and dreams.
Can he have seen my soul? And could she wear
     Such utter life upon a dying face:
Such unappealing, beautiful despair:
     Such garments— soon to be a shroud—with grace?
Has she a charm so calm that it could breathe
     In damp, low places till some frightened hour;
Then start, like a fair, subtle snake, and wreathe
     A stinging poison with shadowy power?
Would I burn palaces? The child has seen
     In this fierce creature of the Commune here,
So bright with bitterness and so serene,
     A being finer than my soul, I fear.","A picture in a newspaper shows a woman who has been burning palaces. “To see the sparks look pretty in the wind?” “And something more.” But women brave as she is, “leave much for cowards, such as I, to guess”"
Long Week Talking,"I am ashamed to keep thinking of death

Home,"It takes a heap o’ livin’ in a house t’ make it home,

Afore ye really ’preciate the things ye lef’ behind,
An’ hunger fer ’em somehow, with ’em allus on yer mind.

How much yer chairs an’ tables cost, how great yer luxury;
It ain’t home t’ ye, though it be the palace of a king,
Until somehow yer soul is sort o’ wrapped round everything.
Home ain’t a place that gold can buy or get up in a minute;
Afore it’s home there’s got t’ be a heap o’ livin’ in it;
Within the walls there’s got t’ be some babies born, and then
Right there ye’ve got t’ bring ‘em up t’ women good, an’ men;
And gradjerly, as time goes on, ye find ye wouldn’t part
With anything they ever used—they’ve grown into yer heart:
The old high chairs, the playthings, too, the little shoes they wore
Ye hoard; an’ if ye could ye’d keep the thumbmarks on the door.
Ye’ve got t’ weep t’ make it home, ye’ve got t’ sit an’ sigh
An’ watch beside a loved one’s bed, an’ know that Death is nigh;
An’ in the stillness o’ the night t’ see Death’s angel come,
An’ close the eyes o’ her that smiled, an’ leave her sweet voice dumb.
Fer these are scenes that grip the heart, an’ when yer tears are dried,
Ye find the home is dearer than it was, an’ sanctified;
An’ tuggin’ at ye always are the pleasant memories
O’ her that was an’ is no more—ye can’t escape from these.
Ye’ve got t’ sing an’ dance fer years, ye’ve got t’ romp an’ play,
An’ learn t’ love the things ye have by usin’ ’em each day;
Even the roses ’round the porch must blossom year by year
Afore they ’come a part o’ ye, suggestin’ someone dear
Who used t’ love ’em long ago, an’ trained ’em jes’ t’ run
The way they do, so’s they would get the early mornin’ sun;
Ye’ve got t’ love each brick an’ stone from cellar up t’ dome:

Lateral Violence,"For Valorie
First a flabby belittlement by some well-meaning
white folks when they cross me because they weren’t meaning
to, they say. It was only that I had become wholly invisible 
and they enjoy their heaping, entitled vocalizations
that enforce their platforms of corporeal speech. 
But through this I learned that I had no real power to wield, 
and this crown I wore, glittering in green fermentation,
put my head into a state of chronic query. 
My desire is lost in a fomenting chrome. 
But then I noticed my solidarity sisters sniff out my lack, too, 
and the vascular trauma of hurt in my blood became 
a wound in my particles. 
Distinctions around difference and assimilation fester
and hurt feelings erupt from lateral power. 
It pains much worse because they seem to be playing
out a supremacy of whiteness, of wielding power
from which an outspread lack peels away to a nothingness 
marked with the pinkest cardinal feelings. 
I don’t believe we outright demean each other,
we might just be trying to fit ourselves in, 
hating all the spirals inside of the shape
trying to let them fizz or spark, but a wrongness
emerges replacing the earned principled feeling. 
I say all this because I look back on how power systems
at play in microaggressions still impart feelings 
of terror because they annihilate, desecrating
the inner self-protection one might seed or learned behind 
some favored sanguine curtains.
I recall myself there hiding a judgment going back colonial centuries: 
how it sticks in fenced edges. How I knew trying to make friends
would undo my best intentions and thwart so much 
of what had been a fernery of deep and culminating sympathies. 
My heart, my mind, my head hoped we’d have real intimacy—
bonded connections based on our chunky hardships,  
not the hard bitten loss in the over-harvested field of 
scarcity knocking several of us down with full force.  
And now do we sit in this field, doing the scholarly work
of facing the empire, but wounded from those 
whom we bitterly wanted on our side, not on our back.","For Valorie: I learned that I had no real power to wield. I don’t believe we outright demean each other. We might just be trying to fit ourselves in, but a wrongness replaces the earned principled feeling."

Swim,"          for Rosalba 
Underwater, my lungs burn at the thought of breaking the surface. 
I am reminded of when I learned to hold my breath. During your first trimester, 
you would breathe in double the amount of oxygen and pump 
ninety percent of it to me. My lungs learning to hold air 
without the possibility of drowning. I break the surface, 
force myself to stay afloat. The weight of my body 
distributed across the water. I think back to lessons 
regarding buoyancy. How I learned to float on my back 
during your second trimester, when our heartbeat was one 
shared song. My body turns in the fetal position. I hold my breath 
              and push off the walls of your stomach– 
my legs kicking and squirming. I think back to when I learned 
how to swim. When your body signaled to me that it was time to leave 
at the end of your third trimester. I could no longer use your umbilical cord 
like a floatie. Into the world I swam. Into a world that warns 
you of the dangers of water without teaching you how to swim. 
I think about how you spend your one day off from work 
at Yosemite Pool. Where you taught yourself how to kick and 
pull and push the water around you to stay alive. Then,

threw me in the water and taught me the same.

Old Age,"In me is a little painted square
Bordered by old shops, with gaudy awnings.
And before the shops sit smoking, open-bloused old men,
Drinking sunlight.
The old men are my thoughts:
And I come to them each evening, in a creaking cart,
And quietly unload supplies.
We fill slim pipes and chat,
And inhale scents from pale flowers in the center of the square . . .
Strong men, tinkling women, and dripping, squealing children
Stroll past us, or into the shops.
They greet the shopkeepers, and touch their hats or foreheads to me . . .
Some evening I shall not return to my people.","In me is a little painted square                Bordered by old shops, with gaudy awnings.

From “Information Desk: An Epic” [Sometimes on my break],"    Sometimes on my break
I’d take my name tag off so no one’d know to
    ask anything of me—such as on the longest days 
of winter break in a slowly chilling
    voice reserved for
when she’d had enough my mother’d
    say, “I’m not your mother”—
and I’d sprawl as she did in our living room

in the Museum not
    cordoned off with red arousing rope like
enormous nipple tassels of
    grief and lust and read Balzac’s Lily of the Valley

    portrait of Princesse de Broglie,
an aged descendant of whom, staunch
    with flirtatious guilt, asked
me at the Information Desk soon

she’d been told she so resembled
    but whom she said she’d only
ever seen in books
    framed above a defunct
mantel regal in a long, cold gown
    the infinite blue
of sorrow and wealth. She is so noble as to have
    four necks: start with the most conspicuous
around which gold shows
    her jugular how to throb,
then take that staircase one flight down
    to the throat of her wrist encircled 
in a helix of a necklace of so many
    pearls a mere bracelet is of
insufficient breadth to bed the many
    oysters from whose recurring
nightmares out they rolled, down with which we go
    one further lucent turning to ground-level
viewing of the naked
    body who stood
for the Princesse that the artist could,
    with the trademark accuracy of ice,
drape over a true female anatomy
    that killer silk
to gaze into is to want to
    drown yourself. That’s three—! then
rush all the way back up the staircase to recall

    Your early death, your blue dress everyone
wants to taste, and the restrained sadness

having just been to the opera, are slung
    over the arm of the chair you’re leaning
on to reveal how your elongated

lock with each

While the Dog Sleeps,"It’s the birthday of Stephen Crane.
On this date, Michelangelo said yes
to the pope and gathered his brushes.
At the church next door, the choir
is rehearsing. There is nothing
I want to rehearse. Recently I’ve
been realizing, “If that didn’t exist, I 
would never miss it.” I say it a lot.
But not about you. We put isinglass
over the screens on the porch so we
could sit there in sweaters, take the time
to see what was in front of us. Now
“tomorrow” is a strange word, “now”
even stranger. “Yesterday” makes sense,
but not much of it is true. Our dog still
keeps sleep. I imagine him dreaming
la dolce far niente. When asked
if I miss what I did for forty years
I like to say, “That never existed.”
Now here on the porch I take in the light
crossing the last leaves doing their slow
dance in the breeze, watch the chickadees
at the feeder, once in a while glance at
the sundial we set in the shade of the redbud. ","It’s the birthday of Stephen Crane. On this date, Michelangelo said yes to the pope and gathered his brushes. “If that didn’t exist, I                 would never miss it,” Crane says."
Three of Cups,"for Brian D.
That night the vindaloo ruined my mouth
for anything but drink. Not the puckerings
of your gasoline, martinis, you called them,
slow and steel . . . I only had those once,
a December night you prepared to press
your luck. Who else would wait to order
on Christmas Eve just to see if it would 
all arrive? A tsunami of rounds, a carnival 
ride in the rain. It was V’s birthday,
so that started us off, bars accumulating
like compound interest: Botanica, blurred
light, Mexican Radio, wet salt, and me
getting broke like a plate. Remember our
first dinner with the soup thick as my waist
and the turkey splintered sweet off the neck?
Before Lori, the bold bartender from 1st &
A, wraps her boyfriend tight with her knees,
he shows us pilot-style how JFK Jr. went down,
how he had to be recovered . . . Must I squeeze 
a drop of blood into this the size of a pimento? 
Or is it enough to bring up this grave spiral of 
hands, my pockets turned out to tiny ghosts, 
and Lori paying twenty bucks in Three of Cups

Letter to al-Mutanabbi,"You were right
Your words are still wings of light
always carrying you to us
sometimes carrying us to you
Your name is a green tattoo
on Baghdad’s tired face
Your street the forehead
of a body beheaded every morning
Just another chapter
in the saga of blood and ink
you knew so well
I cannot lie to you
I’m quite pessimistic
we are still etching
the walls of this cave
thousands of years long
with signs we keep reinterpreting
and myths about a future world
where we don’t devour one another
where the sun is friendly
and the seas cannot inherit our fever
Some are digging
a deeper grave
about to embrace us all
they, too, have their engravings,
maps, philosophers, and books
We can only keep dreaming
of a shore for the wind
and dig wells
in the dark
with fingernails of silence and solitude
we will weave an ocean out of ink
for our myths
and out of words a sail
or a shroud
vast enough for all.
Every book is a well
around which we sit
drinking to your health
trying to live
as you did
with death and after it
Al-Mutanabbi (10th century) was one of the greatest classical Arab poets.

One searched for a new face,
the other for a lip that would listen to its complaints.

away.
The right leg appeared frightened and hesitant,

The Humming-Bird,"The sundial makes no sign
At the point of the August noon.
The sky is of ancient tin,
And the ring of the mountains diffused and unmade
(One always remembers them).
On the twisted dark of the hemlock hedge
Rain, like a line of shivering violin-bows
Hissing together, poised on the last turgescent swell,
Batters the flowers.
Under the trumpet-vine arbor,
Clear, precise as an Audubon print,
           The air is of melted glass,
           Solid, filling interstices
Of leaves that are spaced on the spines
           Like a pattern ground into glass;
           Dead, as though dull red glass were poured into the mouth,
Choking the breath, molding itself into the creases of soft red tissues.
And a humming-bird darts head first,
Splitting the air, keen as a spurt of fire shot from the blow-pipe,
Cracking a star of rays; dives like a flash of fire,
Forked tail lancing the air, into the immobile trumpet;
Stands on the air, wings like a triple shadow
Whizzing around him.
Shadows thrown on the midnight streets by a snow-flecked arc-light,
Shadows like sword-play,
Splinters and spines from a thousand dreams
Whizz from his wings!",The author has written a book about his time in France. The book is called 'The Summer of Love' and is published by Piatkus.
Theodore the Poet,"As a boy, Theodore, you sat for long hours
On the shore of the turbid Spoon
With deep-set eye staring at the door of the crawfish’s burrow,
Waiting for him to appear, pushing ahead,
First his waving antennae, like straws of hay,
And soon his body, colored like soap-stone,
Gemmed with eyes of jet.
And you wondered in a trance of thought
What he knew, what he desired, and why he lived at all.
But later your vision watched for men and women
Hiding in burrows of fate amid great cities,
Looking for the souls of them to come out,
So that you could see
How they lived, and for what,
And why they kept crawling so busily
Along the sandy way where water fails
As the summer wanes.","Theodore Roosevelt was born in 1858. He is the son of Theodore Roosevelt, the first president of the United States. Theodore was born into a poor family. His father, Theodore, was a poor man, too."

a veiny tract meant
for an alfalfa pasture,
clover, sundry grasses

Sunday Morning,"The weather turned bad and I got happy.
That’s wrong—I mean the morning sky
was ash blue, birds on the ground. I mean
not happy but good, not good
but fastened, steady, like every train in the city
was running late, but no one minded.
On 12th Street, tarpaulin swelled
and bowed in wind. Rain drove straight
through a woman’s dress. And again
on Hollis, that slowness: damp black
trees, the line of streetlights
paced like breath. I pulled over. Leaves
dripped like rinsed hands.

I took Green Road to Hubbardsville
and saw October in August, booted men hosing grit
off the park pool’s bottom, crisp leaves lifted
like the remnants of summer’s collective memory.
I drove out or into it listening to the Liverpool Choir’s
mournful version of the national anthem, the tuning forks
of eastern townships bringing a Stravinsky more film score
then symphony. I wanted the blaze of the unmuffled
trumpet, the spin song of the laundromat, a little of the hurricane’s
Guernican remedy in the streeted leaves, in the blooms
of glass from kids breaking fluorescent
light tubes in the spent vocabulary
of an asphalt parking lot. I wanted
October: lace trim of a black dress slumped
on the floor of my birthday, cold skin
and laughter. Little burn on the leaves, little love
declaration; little dull light in the white sky.","The author drove to Hubbardsville, Alabama, to see October in August. She wanted the blaze of the unmuffled trumpet, the spin song of the laundromat, a little of the hurricane’s Guernican remedy."
Explaining the Resurrection in Simple Words,"A blessing can be the act
of invoking divine
protection,
or a favor or gift
bestowed by god,
and I don’t know
how to define mercy,
but the field
is lit like the heart
of the night, gnats flitting
above the crosshatched grass,
huge shadows of the ballplayers in stadium light
whistling in signals
from the outfield.
The wind lifts and settles
our shirts against our skin,
and you ask after my day:
there’d been pinwheels
spinning on a rain-soaked lawn, pigeons
cooing and nesting in the gutters.

damp wood of the trunk.

the rumors of the world.
That they are just heartbeats, almost imperceptible
that become from one moment to the next
like a desperate pounding.

and that it sometimes suffocates,
like the measured sadness
that comes from the impossibility
of seeing one’s own face
in the mirror.","It is possible to hear all the rumors of the world underground. Confinement is part of confinement. humidity sometimes suffocates, like the impossibility of seeing one's own face in the mirror."
Garden Variety with Lesbians,"You rake the soil of our verge, preparing our plot for summer.
Between us, walking—neighbors and dogs, questions: what are we doing here, to the earth
of our verge—unhinged rhizomes heap, clumped grief of an old barrow sways drunk on its wheel.
We agree: the barren of potential; we agree, bulbs—their dormancy, a poem—
and tubers—like language, for their incubation of eyes. I emerge, eyes
on you, nuclear to the sun—beside you, lowering; beside you, that glow-eyed beast
of emptiness arranging.

I tell you about this morning’s dream. You tear the ground with a pickaxe; I manicure
weeds from the loamy apron of a young tree. I admit: I stared at our newborn with regret.
True, you laugh light into our longing. A mother tells me: Early morning dreams are premonitions.
What premonition is it to long to see (the Earth); what regret is it to birth another into this longing?
Impossible resources.

to the earth of our verge—any keen beast knows what, there, next opens: Our raked plot effluvial.
But we know soil is all foreshadow. Fingers subtext glove-fingers, floral print—
syntax is the bacteria of desire.
Our hose froze broken—leaks, screeching—so we bear the water in cans.
*
We bare the water in cans and unload bagged soil from the bed. Our verge leans luxury. We’ll feast
on the effulgence of dinnerplate dahlias. But it’s early spring and I’m already
anxious about regretting labor.
We could fail the future, babe—do you, too, feel our potential
is a meaning leaning too much, too toward, swaying with unhinged grief—Why
do we labor the rearrangement of this plot?
Twist earthful effluvium. Difficult to tell your pants from mine.
We stare back the setting sun: love, a premonition of night foreshadowed
in light’s velvet ash.

Pathetic Fallacy,"When it became impossible to speak to you

or to merge with that darkness.

in the invisible scrim of air
that delineates our separate worlds,

all silvery from the afterlife, woven in wind,
to whisper a caution. Or your hand on my back
shoves me into my life.","When it became impossible to speak to you                due to your having died and been incinerated, I sometimes held the uncradled phone as if embedded in it were some code I could punch in. You bequeathed me this morbid bent, Mother."

Ode to Donor Gametes,"I was not thinking of Russia

It was more complicated than that.

and the third failed IVF, I didn’t care 
about SAT scores or eye color;
I wanted any embryo that latched
to my uterine wall and grew.

the filmmaker from California, even 
the one whose favorite food was pork. 
What did genes matter? I already knew 
I’d name my second child for dead relatives 
from the old country, the ones
who made it out before the camps.

kiddush cup after the seder. 
That was the only time I really prayed.

with ovarian abundance and kind eyes

died and rotted and were crushed into carbon
then coal, then oil in the earth
whose deep core held bigger burning.
My daddy labored here, at The Gulf,
Which meant oil refinery, but also
a distance he drowned in,
caged inside this high hurricane fence.
In steel-toed boots for forty-two years, he walked.
The gold hatpin he got at retirement
had four diamond chips
for a smile and two rubies like eyes,
and he passed it to me
because it was a holy relic
of suffering and sacrifice,
so I wanted it most.
He breathed in this chemical stink
some sixteen hours or days on end
in a storm, and it perfumed his overalls.
The catalyst he pumped on the cracking unit
burst through with enormous pressure to break down
the black crude’s chemical bonds
into layers, into products,
and many ignorant men did twist the spigots
and unplug the clogs and keep it all
rivering so the buried pipes
could carry out so many flammables north—
North! Where books are written and read.
The sunset down here glows green and hard-washed
denim blue and the scalded pink of flesh.

It’ll be all right, my gurgush
There’s a clusterfuck waiting at work,
things that really aren’t personal
but slice you up anyway
You’ll be all right, my malai ka doona
It’ll all get done, my chhunmunita
You think of your mother
whose love birthed all these names
How often she hurt you
and it dawns on you, like a flash
of lightning on an airplane: 
love is a bagad billa
At the pantry, you feed yourself
a boxed lunch of baingan and channa
and remember how she once
stood at the door, hours 
after she locked you up in a room 
a plate of aloo parathas in her hand
and a look that said you were ok now,
the anger under your relief
You swallow the last morsel, feeling
it graze your heart.
Back at work, hungry again.","The author's mother once locked him up in a room and left him with a plate of aloo parathas in her hand. ""Love is a bagad billa,"" he writes. ""You swallow the last morsel"""
To Baudelaire,"The head is the body’s lair.
It may be slightly in front.
Milking these separations,
Words answer the immortal need
For intoxicating monotony. The body
Is the mind’s sieve.
Beloved grief, water drips
From a block of red ice
Onto a perfumed paradise
Lost in the obsessive embrace
Of reader and writer. Superb haloes
Hang from the heads
Of naked slaves whipping themselves.
A new world is required
To stomach the images
Floating on the headless
Torso of the old.
“I was surprised to find myself
Staring at an empty hole.
I ordered flowers.”","The head is the body’s lair. It may be slightly in front. The body is the mind's sieve. Beloved grief, water drips from a block of red ice into a perfumed paradise."
Skull Song,"A sea-god, whose father had been a mortal, becomes a skeleton.
The skin of the sea was thick, to-night,
And the tone of the sea was dull;
When I found by the edge of the sullen sea
The half of a sea-god’s skull.
Half of a sea-god’s skull was there,
Half of a sea-god’s tail.
When I dug them out of the clutch of the sand
The peering moon went pale.
The peering moon went pale, because
Her other eye had seen
The other half of the sea-god’s bones
Ten thousand fathom green . . .
Ten thousand fathom green with sea,
The sea-god’s other bones
Swayed in a dead sea-goddess’s arms
On a pile of sea-washed stones.
The skin of the sea was thick, to-night,
And the tone of the sea was dull,
While I buried away from the sinister sea
All the mortal part of a skull.","A sea-god, whose father had been a mortal, becomes a skeleton. The skin of the sea was thick, to-night, and the tone of the water was dull. Half of a sea-goddess’s skull was there."
Trainee,"The language has us by the throat,
Scorched utensils in a grid. Trained
Tracks, right of way, light
Of day. Enraged bodies whistle by
Cold soot, skipping space entirely.
Letters are so dense it’s convenient
To stop listening. Religious
Seduction scenarios replace
The melancholy human voice,
Its perfected products, trick photos.
Say I say sky, say the city
Of San Francisco sits beneath that.
Have you ever seen a school fence?
A sun set? Fields of speech
The anatomizing phonemes bark at.
A machine shop? In the light
Of the correct time, steel beams
Lift a low stone fog. Tires sing
On freeways that guard the views
From distressed housing.
Convinced condensed devices are at home
In our words. Not to be confused
With us or use. Remove
The caressed blossom, the rug’s still
Brand new, a vacuum.
 ","Letters are so dense it’s convenient to stop listening. The language has us by the throat,Scorched utensils in a grid. Enraged bodies whistle by cold soot."
My One Voice,"At the sound of my voice
I spoke and, egged on
By the discrepancy, wrote
The rest out as poetry.
Read the books, duets
From nowhere say they speak;
Why not let them. Inhabited stares
Leave trees in rearview mirrors.
I came from a neutral point
In space, far from the inside
Of any one head. O say can I
Still see the tabula rasa outshining
That rosy dawn on the near side
Of the genetic code. Doubt,
Thy name is certainty. Generations
Of recordings of the sunrise
Picture the light until the page
Is white and I predict
The present, hearing a future
In the syllables’ erasing day.","At the sound of my voice                I spoke and, egged on                By the discrepancy, wrote                The rest out as poetry.                Read the books, duets                From nowhere say they speak;                Why not let them."
"Senlin: A Biography (Part I, Section II)","It is morning, Senlin says, and in the morning
When the light drips through the shutters like the dew,
I arise, I face the sunrise,
And do the things my fathers learned to do.
Stars in the purple dusk above the rooftops
Pale in a saffron mist and seem to die,
And I myself on a swiftly tilting planet
Stand before a glass and tie my tie.
Vine leaves tap my window,
Dew-drops sing to the garden stones,
The robin chirps in the chinaberry tree
Repeating three clear tones.
It is morning. I stand by the mirror
And tie my tie once more.
While waves far off in a pale rose twilight
Crash on a white sand shore.
I stand by a mirror and comb my hair:
How small and white my face!—
The green earth tilts through a sphere of air
And bathes in a flame of space.
There are houses hanging above the stars
And stars hung under a sea . . .
And a sun far off in a shell of silence
Dapples my walls for me . . .
It is morning, Senlin says, and in the morning
Should I not pause in the light to remember god?
Upright and firm I stand on a star unstable,
He is immense and lonely as a cloud.
I will dedicate this moment before my mirror
To him alone, for him I will comb my hair.
Accept these humble offerings, cloud of silence!
I will think of you as I descend the stair.
Vine leaves tap my window,
The snail-track shines on the stones,
Dew-drops flash from the chinaberry tree
Repeating two clear tones.
It is morning, I awake from a bed of silence,
Shining I rise from the starless waters of sleep.
The walls are about me still as in the evening,
I am the same, and the same name still I keep.
The earth revolves with me, yet makes no motion,
The stars pale silently in a coral sky.
In a whistling void I stand before my mirror,
Unconcerned, and tie my tie. 
There are horses neighing on far-off hills
Tossing their long white manes,
And mountains flash in the rose-white dusk,
Their shoulders black with rains . . .
It is morning. I stand by the mirror
And surprise my soul once more;
The blue air rushes above my ceiling,
There are suns beneath my floor . . .
. . . It is morning, Senlin says, I ascend from darkness
And depart on the winds of space for I know not where,
My watch is wound, a key is in my pocket,
And the sky is darkened as I descend the stair.
There are shadows across the windows, clouds in heaven,
And a god among the stars; and I will go
Thinking of him as I might think of daybreak
And humming a tune I know . . .
Vine-leaves tap at the window,
Dew-drops sing to the garden stones,
The robin chirps in the chinaberry tree
Repeating three clear tones.","It is morning, Senlin says, and in the morning when the light drips through the shutters like the dew,                I arise, I face the sunrise,                And do the things my fathers learned to do."

Letter to Lucy (1803–1808),"Pennsylvanian earth resembles us—
red flesh veiny with water, perfused
with motion & stirred by all the quirky Energies
of life, ours
or a windy marsh with bitterns and ducks—that’s
a business fit for a man like myself, strong & quick
as you can find, Lucy, and not to be found much longer
in the pestilent port of New York
as apprentice-clerk in a commercial house.
I did not realize how dearly I would detest it,
seventy-five thousand persons calling one place
home! & me a merchant! My life has not subdued itself
to Indigo & wine. Thoughts of thee
were like the silver thread I tied last spring
around the phoebe’s leg, knotted loose
to cause no injury but to hold
forever. & soon I will return from a year
of scribbling bad english in a dim room
to show your father my worth. My sum would be
no greater for any more of that. One year given him,
Love, I offer you the rest.

Forest Starships,"(while wandering in the forest at Indian Point, Ellsworth, Maine)
Bats watched them fall, cupped like tiny palms, 
toward earthen forests. 
They land, eager ears up, 
on twigs and felled branches. 
They nestle between lichen, 
  fungi, 
  figure out hyphae, 
  the deep composting web. 
Once homed, aliens echolocate via sonar chirps, 
mimic
Blue Jay, 
Hairy Woodpecker, 
Song Sparrow, 
Black-Capped Chickadee, 
Northern Parula, 
the Black-Throated Green Warbler. 
Thin sound beams traverse the woods, establish generations, 
the milky way’s travelers in their new division. 
The trill of me, me, me, a tiny army of green shells, 
parsing old and new ocean kinships. 
And then they wait. 
Wood fibers decay, 
car tires feed carbon black into morning breezes, 
a hint of rock dust, 
rush hour exhaust fumes. 
They stir the pot, assemble new fuel,
toward the day that conflagration will send them,         
spores and all, 
  toward, 
  toward the orbit, 
  beyond it, 
  into nebulae, 
  closer, so much closer 
  into the dark.","Bats watched them fall, cupped like tiny palms, toward earthen forests. They land, eager ears up,  on twigs and felled branches. They nestle between lichen, fungi, hyphae, the deep composting web."
All Souls’ Day in a German Town,"The leaves fall softly: a wind of sighs
Whispers the world’s infirmities,
Whispers the tale of the waning years,
While slow mists gather in shrouding tears
On All Souls’ Day; and the bells are slow
In steeple and tower. Sad folk go
Away from the township, past the mill,
And mount the slope of a grassy hill
Carved into terraces broad and steep,
To the inn where wearied travellers sleep,
Where the sleepers lie in ordered rows,
And no man stirs in his long repose.
They wend their way past the haunts of life,
Father and daughter, grandmother, wife,
To deck with candle and deathless cross,
The house which holds their dearest loss.
I, who stand on the crest of the hill,
Watch how beneath me, busied still,
The sad folk wreathe each grave with flowers.
Awhile the veil of the twilight hours
Falls softly, softly, over the hill,
Shadows the cross:—creeps on until
Swiftly upon us is flung the dark.
Then, as if lit by a sudden spark,
Each grave is vivid with points of light,
Earth is as Heaven’s mirror to-night;
The air is still as a spirit’s breath,
The lights burn bright in the realm of Death.
Then silent the mourners mourning go,
Wending their way to the church below;
While the bells toll out to bid them speed,
With eager Pater and prayerful bead,
The souls of the dead, whose bodies still
Lie in the churchyard under the hill;
While they wait and wonder in Paradise,
And gaze on the dawning mysteries,
Praying for us in our hours of need;
For us, who with Pater and prayerful bead
Have bidden those waiting spirits speed.","On All Souls’ Day sad folk go away from the township, past the mill, and mount the slope of a grassy hill. The leaves fall softly: a wind of sighs whispers the world’s infirmities. The lights burn bright in the realm of Death."
Gala Noise,"                                        I
All morning the off-tune brimful singing
rruh-khee, scre-chee, cruk-ah, uh-hoo, zurrah
clangs a ruckus over the dream of a collective tempo
and for a fraction of a second, we hear the affections
of a world aligned.

You’d think the sounds were from another century,
knowledge so clearly carried through them.

They resemble the embodied voices of mycelium
sending instructions about, morse code for roots
distributing seminal beliefs
as if they were explaining the strictures of priesthood
or the water table for static-screech cicadas
waiting for their stage appearance every twelve years.

If only we, like all creatures,
were untroubled by catastrophe,
and allowed the soil
to extract, from our marrow-bone bodies,
words that disappoint and words that rhyme.
                                       II
Every day at noon, the crystal mist burns off
high up by the campanile.
Lackadaisical days, sensational ways to feel
in greens and deeper greens.

But the warbling hoot and hiss and serenades we hear
convulse with something sinister we share,
that inner wrangling
shrieking on the sunglow slopes.

What spirit-noise this time permits.
What ordinary pain and ordinary tenderness
after all, remain
memory and memorial by singing and by sound.","Every day at noon, the crystal mist burns off high up by the campanile. The warbling hoot and hiss and serenades we hearconvulse with something sinister we share."
Walking to Athena,"Rome rattlejacks in vernacular,
wishing in Latin, marching arm in arm
with ladybug faces and groomed suitcases.

Someone is playing Liszt from an upper floor
as if it’s 1840, when Hungary was a jigsaw of another place
but Liszt, arriving here, said Mendelssohn couldn’t play his rhapsody
competently, and trashed him as propaganda
before composing the loveliest lieder to his enemy.

Water blows over my skin.
Wind has picked up impressions of splashing
from sparkling drinks or the river I’m crossing.

What a ruckus I find on my stone-walking
visit to the marble Athena at the villa.
A sphinx has elicited Medusa
to petrify a centaur, who as usual is causing havoc
and even the Harpies have taken sides now.
They hang from rooftops, flapping with the laundry.
An old man looks up and drags his finger across his throat with a laugh.

Botanical fever sweeps in from the east,
explaining with the scent of pollen and magnolia
where the garden terrace begins.
A cook smoking on the corner invites me in.
He serves me the most delectable veal that falls off the bone
the way we all fall off the bone.
I put my feet in the cascading waterfall at the Spanish embassy
where a party festivalizes with blue drinks.

Last night, in the giant bed at the hotel,
I dreamed of end-times
and wished I were dreaming in the dream.

I hope Athena recognizes me.
We’re been talking on the phone for years.
Maybe she will say truth is in the psalms.
We always talk about the form of epics, their sing-song
revenge, and she likes to rave about Odysseus
who she loved most, and how he got his revenge.
But Dante got the last word, I argue,
by drowning Odysseus for advising his men to sail
beyond the knowable world, knowing they would end.

When we meet, I hope I have the courage to say
epics are the sea voyage of imagination
but all the songs are here.

I meet my Athena from the dawn of the first century.
She is larger than I expect and smaller
than the gold and ivory Athena
made in the fifth century BC for the Parthenon
that she was carved to resemble.

The sea voyage lieder Liszt arranged for Mendelssohn
feels so cleaved open as if it had forgotten
what to make of itself in the middle of composing.","Liszt said Mendelssohn couldn't play his rhapsodyCompetently, and trashed him as propaganda before composing the loveliest lieder to his enemy."
Plum Cake,"I’d make a plum cake when she died,
a lamentation grief-bake, Kaddish through blood-recipe,
all of its colors shrieking at me; a sweet take on her love.
I gaze at the street. Tree branches out front are tangled,
my floor is slanted, my house-cage is so small and dark
for all the summits, slopes, and swamps of feeling.
I am not to be purple-plum-decided in any still-life of grief
or reminiscence, no waferlike religious feeling, never—
she will never be human again. I knew I wouldn’t make it.
Italian plums are sweetest. I should find them in a market
when days are longer; fruit-of-aging, gift-of-goodness.
A friend who lost a friend and made the cake said plum
six times in one paragraph, so full of yearning are our phrases.
Snow-bright is her hair on the bed, knobby knuckle-skin
folded on her chest. She’d be delighted to celebrate her death.
I love that, she’d say happily about the plum-cake wake.
Plums pooled around the cake-slab in the photograph,
bloody and marvellous. Skylight took her in. I couldn’t make it.","Italian plums are sweetest. I should find them in a market when days are longer. I’d make a plum cake when she died, Kaddish through blood-recipe."
"Ode to Patrick Kearns, Funeral Director of the Leo F. Kearns Funeral Home, in Queens","By blood we go into the fabric of what once felt hymnal at worst;
we are tuned to higher pitches now, in languages invented,
not imagined rites of spring but last rites in strange establishments.
Trucks collect the dead and roll uptown to bury in a potter’s field
corpses we knew, and loved, their long solemn graves
together, better here than bodies shelved or stacks of flesh
shipped out of state to cremate or left to rot. We formalized obituaries
(she was first to graduate, he escaped, she was a composer, he,
though deaf, was a composer, too; we pray alone to keep their souls
alive) until this month. We lived in adverbs, dressed for rainshine
half the time and not according to the daily toll, not this running
tally, at scale in every borough. Our minds are lost to gravity
again. By gravity we live. We move from cell to fingers, toes,
our footprint handprint fingerprint alone identifies us as one
person in this widening morgue; you men and women of generations,
ever upward, we say now; if Whitman could, he’d hold us dear,
our arms, our feet, our hands, our fingerprinted fingers wrapped in his—
“myself disintegrated, every one disintegrated yet part of the scheme”—
and renew us with varied meanings, rebellious curiosities;
I will miss him in my future, if it is me, and in twenty or a hundred years,
history will ask: How did we wear on with so much
weeping? It was never so beautiful as this April
in the park with yellow oaks deliriously blooming
despite the trill of siren after siren to the east; we ignored it,
walking west or north, southeast, any which way
someone else wasn’t. Sunlight far-flung itself
sideways across the arms-up oaks and Olmsted’s slopes;
oh I was rapt, convinced this surreal afternoon was magic-cast
in lavender and grass-green thickening itself, cardinals flying
straight up into that vanishing we are all doing now,
minding our eternities—transcendent limbo, this,
but cherish the eclipse, our orbit moving over
our polyphonic voices in fugue-walking choices, prelude
to nothing, yes, nothing, because when the wind is all C major
unravelling in D minor, we are in the neuro-beat of wondering
who will stay today and who departs tomorrow, but here
are my children, my coffin, my love, it doesn’t matter what color
the coffin is or that we swooned too long in idioms; we broke
on counterpoint and this is where it leads. I swear
this is not my story. On our tombstones, what do we see?
What we love most is always free and far irrational,
fine with me. What is true today
if not my teeth, my bones, my nothingness? Is it near?
I must endear myself. I’ll think, oh, it wasn’t me, I was
just a sentence after all. But my sentence: Was it wrong?
I am young to be this old, too old to be that young.
When we are all accounted for, someone will surely say:
Unevenly I conclude we count facts because we cannot lose our minds
in facts; we lose them in the vivid air, thousands elsewhere.","By blood we go into the fabric of what once felt hymnal at worst. We are tuned to higher pitches now, in languages invented, not imagined rites of spring but last rites in strange establishments. If Whitman could, he’d hold us dear."
Landscape with Double Bow,"Rondeau is what you really want, solo and refrain,
we and each the musical improvisation of the operatic day,
sonic scavenging and comedic jigging inside some Beckett
of one another; oh, wouldn’t it be grand to be a whole note
dragged across the bridge of your singular, sound-expanding
double bow, to be orchestral, to be drunk, to drink the velvet sun
from the arbor trellis; fruit-of-purple grapes we plucked—
bunches of dolce to color our throats and that improvised
word-spun truth I, terrified, say I can’t derive on cue: death,
light, blueprints that fit the choral codes of what music thinks
writing is about. We twisted grape notes so easily off their stems,
screw of death in cupped hands. We follow seductions of light—
You move above and underneath the strings in sea strokes.
One bow was not enough to match the warmth two bows create,
so you invented ways to get more harmony, upper bow and under bow
independent but close, staccato and legato, legato and staccato,
to choose a way to hear the world and harvest sound in it—
curve of bow, curve of earth, curves your eyes interpret as ultraviolet—
Still you want more color, more sound to harvest, more distortion.
Pale-blue resonators you sculpted in local clay, land-in-sky
blue above the land, distort the sound you widened already.
You are looking for a vibration lower than what the lowest string
is tuned to, pitched so low your ear can’t find it—
imagination, lore, solo of magma, baritone of fantasia.
I cannot rogue my syllables and improvise around
temptation ears like yours but love the glut, the secret, the grand
distortions of your polyphonic heart, which believes in ghost tones.
What is true? Grapes chandelier from the arbor
and ripen on the tongue. We jammed the grapes inside a bowl,
so plentiful, and ate their tiny hearts at lunch.","The piece was written in response to a question about the nature of music. The piece is about the musical improvisation of the operatic day, says the composer."
Van Gogh’s Violin,"GOOD

Hurry before all the firmament
Starts to fall apart again
Right now it’s all singing
“Good morning, Vincent!”
  YES YET
This remarkable day
Goes between
Because I paint it
With me in it
  PERFECTLY GREAT
It would be great
To eat an apple
But there in the tree
It is perfect
Flesh covers face
Wheat covers field
  PARTICLE BREAD
Flesh covers face
Wheat covers field
  CLOSE-UP
My nose sticks out
      A doorknob
As my poor ear grows
Like a worm back to my head
A crack, that is my brow
And yesterday is my lips
And my teeth are rocks
      I walk on
  MISANTHROPE, OR . . .
Shy of people
Friend to star in sky
Where am I?
In a park watching children
Play without thinking
  PAINT TOUNGE
I cannot stop
To think
  DETAIL
Black bites deeper
Spitting red beside my bed
Struggling through deep forest
Limb line limn time
It’s all detail! Everything!
  HEIGHTENED WITH WHITE CHALK
Running chalk over my lips
Ecstasy directly transmitted
To grass blade after blade
  INTERRUPT DREAM
All joy of LIFE flashes
Blinding revelation green
Simply morning, all the
Racket, all the LANGUAGE
Broken dream pours in
Nothing holds blue
Corners of REALITY
As I reach out, brush
One more tree in the garden
Under the masterful Sun
  IT’S IMPORTANT
To put up with everything
As you get it down on paper
  LAST PASS
Plow down the sun
Second wind, Old Bay
Last pass on this acre
Go home, go home
Wait—gold. More gold!
  POTATO IN SKY
The back of the shed
Needs painting
What next!
  PLYING MY TRADE
If I sit here long enough
Maybe I’ll figure out what it is
  SHEAVES OF WHEAT
There is no stopping now
What I want is everything
And everything is arriving
At once to me
  LIFE
Blend foreground
      in background
Temperance in the midst
      of ecstasy
Ha. Lalala. Fill up
Holes with death
  VIOLIN
Write everything down
Throw everything away
  SUNSET
This morning I raised my eye
And saw the stars
Had not moved
Sweet Death, my Love,
I will never lose you again","Vincent van Gogh painted a portrait of himself in early May, 1889. The painting is called Wheat Field with Rising Sun. Van Gogh’s work is considered to be one of the most beautiful paintings of the 20th century."

The Poem","The Poem is a collection of poems written by William Blake. The Poem was published by Penguin Random House, Inc. in 1881."
The Earth,"What can I tell her over breakfast when she says
her son suffers from madness, and because there
is no mental health, he has ended up in jail,
and she is relieved, because at least he might
be safe there or he might get to see the doctor.
We are eating egg-white omelets; we are counting
carbs. We are buttoning ourselves in our clean dresses
and high-heeled shoes in order to bring home the bacon,
doing what we need to do and “It is what it is.”
Her granddaughter and daughter are living with her
in the one bedroom. Nights, the daughter lounges by
the pool, looking at her phone, while she teaches the child
to plant seeds in a flower bed she feels bad she does not own.
She tells she cried in the car coming here; she did not know
me then. She thought we would be talking to each other
the whole time about what we are selling, what
the other might buy, but somehow we left that behind
over the toast with the tiny pots of strawberry jam.
Who can explain all this luxury, all this despair?
Or how we all hold our secret shames so close
and gloss our lips with “Cinnamon Fire” as if that were
some legitimate form of protection. Cinnamon Fire!
She just turned fifty. I tell her wait ten years—you
won’t know more, but you will get closer to forgiving,
because it is all happening on a wheel that spins
so fast. Why not stop to look at the pink flowers
you’ve planted with your granddaughter? Why not feel
your bare toes in the good wet earth? We play with the crusts
on our plates. The waitress takes the coffee away. We
are strangers again, each carrying our lonely fear
our children won’t find their way, wishing for them
some inner logic—sacred trust of earth and self, that exists
for each of us so far within, so far under the skin, we
can’t even begin to say what it is made of; it merely is,
poised between love and grief: the blue space we call wonder,
which is merely the dew on the grass, the shadow the sun
makes as it rolls over the vast skin of the Earth.","The author's granddaughter and daughter are living with her in a one-bedroom apartment. The daughter lounges by the pool, looking at her phone, while she teaches the child to plant seeds in a flower bed."
Louise,"Dedamet. I saw you, after the first flush of blooms.
I was picking through the ruins for my roots but you weren’t there.
Must I make an agreement with the living?
I cut the spike.
I surrendered to your dormancy.
Later, I cooed at the new growing from the old.
I kissed each bud as they swelled and broke, one at a time, to reveal the private ledger of your birth.
Without documentation. Without the truckloads of gravel between us, pinning our bodies in place.
When white flowers unfurled again, I stayed on the threshold of memory.
I didn’t have to give up anything. Not my pursuit of facts. Not my wildness.
I let the unexpected take shape: a mirror-image symmetry betraying your face.
What can I learn from your living? Your vagaries and blossoms?
I reach for you, madare madar bozorgam. Toward a past swallowed by stone. Unmapped yet in the earth. The orchid, my promise to care for that which animates us both. 
I promise to wrest you from the hands of those who would rewrite your life. No. No. I promise:
I promise touch. I promise my voice. I promise a willingness to dream.
I promise your face hewn into lost history.",The orchid was born in a field of gravel. The author cut the spike off the flower and kissed each bud to reveal its private ledger of its birth.
The Bearing Edge,"For DJ
My son starts every conversation  
with the statement “I love you, Dad.”  
“I love you, Dad. What’s for dinner tonight?”  
“I love you, Dad. Is it supposed to rain?”  
“I love you, Dad. Can we go for a walk?”  
“I love you, Dad, but you really have to chill.”  
He’s like the guy who wears a bow tie  
to the bar and to the beach.  
He’s a dandy of affection, at once  
rolling up his pennies and spending them  
on ice cream. He’ll wear this phrase  
to heaven (he’s already been to hell—  
what he calls fostercareless). If  
Orpheus had a lyre, then he has a bearing  
edge. He will not drum without it:  
“I love you, Dad.” 
He moves forward by glancing back, 
and no one is ever lost. 
The sky sells cotton candy;  
the trees, shade. 
Love—it’s a kind of leash, invisible,  
expanding, and I’m his big, happy dog.","DJ's son starts every conversation with the statement “I love you, Dad.” He’s like the guy who wears a bow tie                  to the bar and to the beach."

"My Friend, Her Grandson","Brigantine Beach
I.
The wind is blue.
Blue, the boy tells me.
It dusts the reed-filled dunes,
then scuds across sand to water’s edge.
II.
We lie on the beach. Gray waves
advance, retreat. The blue wind, salt scrub,
scours my skin. Sharks troll for toddlers.
Patrol planes hum below the cloudy scrim.
III.
I climb the jetty’s ragged point.
From the churning reef,
I find the boy, a speck on the shore,
asleep on a blue cot. 
IV.      
His grandmother’s hand
soothes his damp head. She sings,
songs that lilt on the blue wind.
The jets drone on in steel-eyed formation.
           
V.
A black-headed gull arrows toward the buoy.","Brigantine Beach is one of the most popular beaches in the world. The beach is popular with holidaymakers from all over the world, including the UK."
The Author’s Picture,"While in my matchless graces wrapt I stand,
And touch each feature with a trembling hand;
Deign, lovely self! with art and nature’s pride,
To mix the colours, and the pencil guide.
Self is the grand pursuit of half mankind;
How vast a crowd by self, like me, are blind!
By self, the fop, in magic colours shown,
Tho’, scorn’d by ev’ry eye, delights his own:
When age and wrinkles seize the conqu’ring maid,
Self, not the glass, reflects the flatt’ring shade.
Then, wonder-working self! begin the lay;
Thy charms to others, as to me, display.
Straight is my person, but of little size;
Lean are my cheeks, and hollow are my eyes;
My youthful down is, like my talents, rare;
Politely distant stands each single hair.
My voice, too rough to charm a lady’s ear;
So smooth, a child may listen without fear;
Not form’d in cadence soft and warbling lays,
To sooth the fair thro’ pleasure’s wanton ways.
My form so fine, so regular, so new;
My port so manly, and so fresh my hue;
Oft, as I meet the crowd, they laughing say,
“See, see Memento Mori cross the way.”
The ravished Proserpine at last, we know,
Grew fondly jealous of her sable beau;
But, thanks to nature! none from me need fly;
One heart the devil could wound—so cannot I.
Yet, tho’ my person fearless may be seen,
There is some danger in my graceful mien:
For, as some vessel toss’d by wind and tide,
Bounds o’er the waves, and rocks from side to side;
In just vibration thus I always move:
This who can view, and not be forc’d to love?
Hail! charming self! by whose propitious aid
My form in all its glory stands display’d:
Be present still; with inspiration kind,
Let the same faithful colours paint the mind.
Like all mankind, with vanity I’m bless’d;
Conscious of wit I never yet possess’d.
To strong desires my heart an easy prey,
Oft feels their force, but never owns their sway.
This hour, perhaps, as death I hate my foe;
The next I wonder why I should do so.
Tho’ poor, the rich I view with careless eye;
Scorn a vain oath, and hate a serious lie.
I ne’er, for satire, torture common sense;
Nor show my wit at God’s, nor man’s expence.
Harmless I live, unknowing and unknown;
Wish well to all, and yet do good to none.
Unmerited contempt I hate to bear;
Yet on my faults, like others, am severe.
Dishonest flames my bosom never fire;
The bad I pity, and the good admire;
Fond of the muse, to her devote my days,
And scribble—not for pudding, but for praise.
These careless lines, if any virgin hears,
Perhaps, in pity to my joyless years,
She may consent a gen’rous flame to own,
And I no longer sigh the nights alone.
But, should the fair, affected, vain, or nice,
Scream with the fears inspir’d by frogs or mice;
Cry, Save us, heav’n! a spectre, not a man!
Her hartshorn snatch, or interpose her fan:
If I my tender overture repeat;
O! may my vows her kind reception meet!
May she new graces on my form bestow,
And, with tall honours, dignify my brow!",The poem is written in the style of French poet Memento Mori. It is titled ‘The Fop’ and is written by the same author as the famous painting of the same name. ‘Self is the grand pursuit of half mankind; how vast a crowd by self are blind!’
On the Death of Sir Erasmus Philips,"Unfortunately drowned in the River Avon, near Bath, October 15, 1743
Why dash the floods! What cries my soul affright!
How steep the precipice! How dark the night!
Then Virtue sunk in Avon’s fatal wave,
No friend to succour, no kind hand to save; 
The circling waters hide his sinking head,
The treach’rous bottom forms his oozy bed. 
Behold the bloated corpse, the visage pale; 
See here what virtue, wealth, and birth avail.
What now remains beneath this load of pain?
To weep is nature, but to weep is vain.
What now remains? It yet remains to try 
What hope, what peace, religion can supply: 
It yet remains to catch the parting ray,
To note his worth ere mem’ry fade away,
To mark how various excellence combin’d, 
Recount his virtues, and transcribe his mind. 
It yet remains with holy rites to lay,
The breathless reliques in their kindred day.
Ye wise, ye good, the holy rites attend,
Here lies the wise man’s guide, the good man’s friend.
Awhile let faith exalt th’ adoring eye, 
And meditation deep suspend the sigh;
Then close the grave, and sound the fun’ral knell,
Each drop a tear, and take a last farewell; 
In peace retire, and wish to live as well.","Virtue sunk in Avon’s fatal wave, with no friend to succour, no kind hand to save. Unfortunately drowned in the River Avon, near Bath, October 15, 1743."
The Sluggard,"’Tis the voice of the Sluggard: I heard him complain,
“You have wak’d me too soon, I must slumber again;”
As the door on its hinges, so he on his bed,
Turns his sides, and his shoulders, and his heavy head.
“A little more sleep, a little more slumber,”
Thus he wastes half his days and his hours without number;
And when he gets up he sits folding his hands,
Or walks about saunt’ring, or trifling he stands.
I pass’d by his garden, and saw the wild brier,
The thorn and the thistle, grow broader and higher.
The clothes that hang on him are turning to rags:
And his money still wastes, till he starves or he begs.
I made him a visit still hoping to find
He had took better care for improving his mind:
He told me his dreams, talk’d of eating and drinking;
But he scarce reads his Bible, and never loves thinking.
Said I then to my heart, “Here’s lesson for me;
That man’s but a picture of what I might be:
But thanks to my friends for their care in my breeding,
Who taught me betimes to love working and reading.","The Sluggard is a man who wastes half his days and his hours without number. He has no time to read his Bible, and never loves thinking. His money still wastes, till he starves or he begs."
Wail,"for the young who ask, “How did you learn to like yourself?”
There are glaciers, imposing, yet shrinking.
There is the iris, violet sky cradling shards of sun.
The white Bengal tiger, snow and black ink.
Infinite reasons I could give for gladness,
though none may salve the wound from which
your question arises, how to be glad to be alive?
Stitch your heart’s fissure: recall family, friends,
a slap, cigarette burn, the rod, something smashed 
down, or welled up in your darkened pupil.
Turn outward: two A.M. streets, the creeps in cars,
the chaos of human folly delivered by calm,
coiffed news anchors. The wound is within you
and not. The answer within you and not.
Want, comfort, desire, love ought not be wounds.
We pine for them from our first wail,
what you must give and take, till no voice is left.","For the young who ask, “How did you learn to like yourself?’ The answer within you and not. The wound is within you, and not the answer is not."
The Genie Speaks,"I will start again tomorrow, after waking under
the fingernails of Scheherazade. Small things
will become large, and large things will become
themselves. It is an old story and familiar, despite
how much I hate being divided. Here I am, despite
how much I should not be. At this moment, I am
reaching far into a page that is oozing like honey-
comb. If you will pardon my hyperbole, there are
leaves of something that matters, I do not know
what, blowing in every direction. At the foretold
moment, our other earth opens a secret hand. If
there is a purpose, we will know it soon enough,
although not knowing feels satisfactory and good:
better than good, I am tempted to say to the bees.","The author is writing a book about his time in Afghanistan. He says he will start again tomorrow, after waking under the fingernails of Scheherazade."
The Caseworker Speaks of a Good Fit,"Morning laps at its bowl of water.
The lake eagerly greets the shore.
A man in his bathrobe does the daily puzzle,
the smell of coffee—six across.
A boy upstairs lingers in bed.
The warmth of the sheets envelops him.
“How many letters?” “Does it fit?”
The promise of pancakes—four across.
He had dreamt forever of a scene like this:
family, food, a true-green home.
(Violence: that’s a cross word puzzle.
The way he’d cry—eleven down.)
Late afternoon. The wind picks up.
A single blank remains.
“I think I’ve got it. Everything fits!”
His heart billows like a sail.",A man in his bathrobe does the daily puzzle. The smell of coffee is the promise of pancakes. The wind picks up. The lake eagerly greets the shore.
Parasitoid,"Her father said don’t stay out late,
his hand too long on her shoulder.  
I would have driven a mower into the side
of his blue Camaro but my feet couldn’t 
reach the pedals. I could have punched
high enough to graze the perfect arc
of his jaw, but I wasn’t strong yet. 
My mother promised me height,
a broad chest, and hands big enough 
to sing all the songs of war.
His smile swung its hook above us,
so we leapt gates, she and I.
Pretend you’re a scorpion
and I’ll be the peregrine, talons out.
You can’t hide!
Our paths tore grass,
crazed gnats in the fallow. 
Deer flies followed us back home 
and needled into dreams in which 
we shed skin like wool and writhed 
under pins and wires—because bugs have bugs
that bite ‘em. I dreamt of feeding pieces
of myself into the mouth of a beast 
until the beast outweighed my fear.  
When we woke starred with bites, her father 
flung her against the wall as if to slap dust
off a rug. His handprint on her faded slow 
as water off a handkerchief. The things 
we were taught had something to do 
with mosquitos hurtling themselves at us
like there was a law for it, with her mother
dozing in the window, and with what touch does
to make a girl a castaway bird, grieving 
from the boughs, an out-in-the-open orphan 
gentling toward a dying time.  
I couldn’t muster the courage to ask 
how she could still vault a rain barrel in sheer glee. 
Only allowed to finger the last knot of her hair, 
I kept chasing till my legs were a twist 
of nerves and brittle gears.
I am neither strong nor tall 
and my hands can’t grasp 
beyond the quiet in us, wary as deer 
in the clearing where she’d command me 
to undress. Lay down. Don’t move. 
I wanted to believe wasps could fumble 
painlessly against us like snow 
tumbled from the leaves’ miscellaneous hands. 
She wanted to be dangerous, the one 
giving orders, and so on ad infinitum . . .","The author's mother promised him height, a broad chest, and hands big enough to sing all the songs of war. His father said don’t stay out late, his hand too long on her shoulder, his smile swung its hook above us."
Ship/Plum,"the ears lie but claim
the eyes lie or perhaps the body
either way the world is a ship
I call it “vestibular unease”

motionsick in my stationary body

I live on a yellow submarine
not quite as glamorous as it sounds

your heels pleasurably into the floor

To a Bride,"Thou askest, O my friend, a song to-day;
But what soft note, what subtle melody
Can thy young heart’s delicious joy convey?
In Life’s enchanted lyre, one chord alone
Can thrill thee with a music all its own,
And fill thine heart with one most perfect tone.
What need, then, hast thou that I sing to thee?
June roses for thy bridal, fair to see,
Are sweeter music than my notes can be;
And song-birds flitting thro’ the fragrant air,
And stars that gleam, like living eyes, from where
Thine own turn softly in thy troth-plight prayer.
Then silence, sweeter than all varied sound,
Shall fold thee soft, like loving arms around,
For life’s most perfect gift thy heart hath found.","The song was written in the early 20th century. It is set to the tune of ""Ave Maria"" by Mozart. The song is about a young man and his love for music."
On Finding My Father’s First Essay,"It must have been hard for him on days 
when the sun hit the muddy delta, 
sending up what smelled like failure, 
rotten and man-made. Still, he drove 
his old, rusty car down Pacific to 
the college, where he sat by those 
half his age who knew little of how 
they would begin, how easily beginnings 
turn into a thousand dark miles of water.
But they knew school, much more about it
than he did-which words to use when, 
how to give nothing but the requirement, 
to hide between clauses and commas.
This was his mistake of the essay 
called “What Life Means to Me”:
         My shadow on the ocean’s face, the frayed 
         water behind a boat. Rainbows and valleys 
         and leis for my daughters, that they forgive 
         me for leaving and all that I couldn’t give.
Some nameless face read through it, asking 
for predicates, circling fragments, then went on, 
knowing our father’s tears, yet deeming them
unremarkable. I can see his hands thumbing 
the red-marked page, searching for a glimpse 
of understanding and finding none, his face 
burning with shame for not knowing how much 
it would take to begin again, to go back across 
the water. He must have left that day thinking 
he had to work even harder for our love, to be 
a real father, responsible and clean as grammar.","He wrote an essay called ‘What Life Means to Me’ It was written for his daughters, but he didn’t know how to use the words. He left thinking he had to work even harder for their love."
The Maze,"I saw the
dead bird on the sidewalk
his neck uncovered
and prehistoric
At seven in the morning
my hair was bound
against the fish in the air
who begged for the ocean
I longed for their place
Behind the
tall thin muslin of the curtain
we could see his shadow
knocking
and we waited
not stirring
crouched by the fireplace
where the ashes blew out
later we checked the harbor
to see if it was safe
rather hoping
one had gone astray
and flung itself upon the shore
for all to watch
If I should weep
they would never know
and so I walked
silently
shrugging off hands
in treacherous places
wanting to fall
In Williamsburg, Virginia
my uncle
pointed out the Maze
which grew
in the dead
governor’s garden
delighted
I went to it
and stood 
poised
inside the
precise
entrance
like a long hallway
the tightly trimmed
bushes
held themselves
pointing each
leaf
and twig
in an unquestioning manner
white gravel
caressed my feet
the sky disappeared
and I
could hear
the sound of water
rushing
I knew each corner
without pausing
Held captive in a cave
Ulysses
sobbed for his wife
who was singing high
melodies
from the center of a 
cobweb shawl
of their design 
three feathers
I picked
from a stone
in my path
and turning at last
I saw
the speckled bench
and halting fountain
which marked 
the end.
She
tortures
the curtains of the window
shreds them
like some
insane insect
creates a 
demented web
from the thin folds
her possessed fingers
clawing she
thrusts them away with
sharp jabs of long pins
to the walls.

Pō,"Before the land was tamed by industry, 
the oceanside resorts and pineapple plantations, 
before the cane knife's rust, the dark time of sickness, 
the coming of cannons, the bitter waters drunk, 
before the metallic salt of blood, the rain emptied 
into rivers, the winds carved valleys and mountains, 
before the earth spurted fire, birthed islands, 
her churning magma and her inner core of iron, 
before the stars dwarved, their coronas ignited, 
before the centripetal spin of galaxies, 
the unwinding gestures of time and space, 
before the light and heat-
There was darkness without breath and Pō, 
pressing the entirety of a universe into a shell 
the size of an atomic nucleus, waiting.","Before the oceanside resorts and pineapple plantations, the land was tamed by industry. Before the stars dwarved, their coronas ignited, and before the centripetal spin of galaxies, the unwinding gestures of time and space."

To Patrizia

In Chiasso, in an anonymous 
courtyard at the close 
of the ‘50s, kids 
play, scaling
fences and beating rugs 
in a puff of iron and grass.
The afternoon undying. Relentless 
sheep-shaped clouds in the sky.
Relentless games.
They climb the fence and hook 
their knees over the crossbeams 
heads down arms dangling 
and in their irrepressible 
small voices shout 
we’re monkeys
beautiful brown apes orango-tangos 
tiny monkeys doing the Petash 
and laugh in the late postwar period.
“Petacci!” they’re corrected 
by a mother with a long memory.
“Play all you want, don’t hurt yourselves, 
but it’s called ‘Do the Petacci.’ And remember, 
she wasn’t the only one 
to hang.”

Stellar Body,"translated from the Italian by Will Schutt.
You pursue me with a thought, are a thought 
that comes to me without thinking, like a shiver 
you slowly scorch my skin and lead my eyes 
toward a clear point of light. You’re a memory 
retrieved and glowing, you’re my dream 
beyond dreams and memories, the door that closes 
and opens onto a wild river. You’re something 
no word can express, and in every word you resonate 
like the echo of a slow exhale, you’re my wind 
rustling the spring foliage, the voice that calls 
from a place I do not know but recognize as mine.
You’re the howl of a wolf, the voice of the deer 
alive and mortally wounded. My stellar body.
    Corpo Stellare 
Mi segui con un pensiero, sei un pensiero 
che non devo nemmeno pensare, come un brivido 
mi strini piano la pelle, muove gli occhi 
verso un punto chiaro di luce. Sei un ricordo 
perduto e luminoso, sei il mio sogno 
senza sogno e senza ricordi, la porta che chiude 
e apre sulla corrente di un fiume impetuoso. Sei una cosa 
che nessuna parola può dire e che in ogni parola 
risuona come l’eco di un lento respiro, sei il mio vento 
di foglie e primavere, la voce che chiama 
da un posto che non so e riconosco e che è mio.
Sei l’ululato di un lupo, la voce del cervo 
vivo e ferito a morte. Il mio corpo stellare.","The poem was written in Italian and translated from the Italian by Will Schutt. ""You pursue me with a thought, are a thought  that comes to me without thinking, like a shiver"""
Brief Homage to Pluto,"translated from the Italian by Will Schutt.
1
Don’t go down again. Here, 
on this windy night,
somewhere on a night of never-ending 
headlights and roads, Pluto
is waiting down below for you to rise.
Down below—if he remains 
in his enclosure. This is how
it must be. Don’t go down again, go on.
Toward your days, yours alone and no one’s.
Toward sweeter nights to divvy up 
with others, like fruit. Don’t go down again, 
go on.
  2
Because rain, because wind and valleys 
at night, yellow grass, breath. That water 
raking the alleys and fields. Because 
there is no truce or tomorrow. Only 
these bars, the cage of an I.
Hell is not being others, 
watching them slip by and disappear:
a parking lot that slowly empties, 
the windblown worksite.
  3
Opening your hand, that’s the hard part. Releasing
something without sacrifice, without 
deceit. Being the face
that fades from you, the wing that flits away, the cry 
that does not cry for you.
    Breve omaggio a Plutone 
  1
Non ridiscendere. Qui 
nella notte del vento, 
da qualche parte nella notte, lunga 
di fari e strade, Plutone
aspetta che tu sali, più in basso.
Più in basso: se resta 
nel suo chiuso. Dev’essere 
così: non ridiscendere, vai.
Verso i tuoi giorni, solo tuoi e di nessuno.
Verso altre notti più dolci da spezzare 
come un frutto, con altri. Non ridiscendere, 
vai.
  2
Perché la pioggia, perché il vento e le pianure 
notturne, l’erba gialla, il respiro. Quell’acqua 
che scroscia nei vicoli, e i prati. Perché 
non c’è tregua, o domani. Soltanto 
le sbarre, la gabbia di un io.
L’inferno è non essere gli altri, 
guardarli passare e sparire nel niente:
un posteggio che piano si svuota, 
il cantiere del vento.
  3
Aprire la mano: questo è difficile. Lasciare 
qualcosa senza sacrificio, senza 
falsità. Essere il volto
che si allontana da te, l’ala che sfugge, il pianto 
che non piange per te.",The poem was written in Italian and translated from the Italian by Will Schutt. It is called Plutone and is written in the form of a refrain.
Diaspora Sonnet at the Feeders Before the Freeze,"I’m getting cold and the trees have darkened
into a tobacco-colored stain. Birds
cease calling each other—no more ears
in the branches. I haven’t slept for two nights
because their silence skewers everything.
My thoughts cannot be broken. The depths
of my thinking sink me. I hold firm
despite the rain, its dissolution.
There are no sparrows or chickadees, they
no longer fling back their heads, exalted.
Where have they gone? The birds and the finery
of their throats? Their gratitude for seed and suet?","There are no sparrows or chickadees, they they no longer fling back their heads, exalted. I haven’t slept for two nights because their silence skewers everything."
Diaspora Sonnet Imagining My Father’s Uncertainty and Nothing Else,"On condition of anonymity
we are conditioned by antonyms. There,
the thing made—villainous and ill-tempered.
Repulsive. We’re made beasts. Formed from many
scales. How does one love a thing that loves nothing?
Made from the wrack and wreck of you—image
of you, and sent by you to fight your fights,
thus we are all parts and parts. Hibernal
and truant, until your remembrances
have mislaid all the best of you into
us. Tilt our heads, turned this way and that, see
all our old stitching come undone. Our sons—
they see the made thing we have become, hurt
to flinching. The song of skin, soon unsung. ","We are made from the wrack and wreck of you, and sent by you to fight your fights. The song of skin, soon unsung. Tilt our heads, turned this way and that, see all our old stitching come undone."
You Must Lift Your Son’s Languid Body,"off the couch, tuck him into whatever
soft breach of the covers he can needle
into. You must lift your own tired self
beyond the threshold of the door
and snuff each candle till the smoke
writes the hours into the quiet house.
Must lift each pillow from the day
where new dangers thrust their heads
up from the anchoring grass. Each living
rage beyond the break of the horizon,
past your sight even on this cloudless day.
Because the future drives on new tires—
because the plateau piles everything
you love back into dust. We drive our pick
through the mineral of our apprehensions
and put our loves to bed without stopping
ourselves. Without pausing despite our worn
trunks. Without stopping our breath of song.",You must lift your own tired self beyond the threshold of the door. You must lift each pillow from the day where new dangers thrust their heads into the anchoring grass. Because the future drives on new tires.
Autism Screening Questionnaire: Social Interaction Difficulties,"1. Does your child have poor eye contact? Does he stare from unusual angles?
Yes. Like a dark bird from a high perch.
Yes. With acetylene torches lit somewhere in the distance.
With eyes wide as the Morpho’s iridescence.
Yes. Wild and hot like fixed stars.
2. Does your child not seem to listen when spoken to directly?
We call it dappled thoughts. He is constantly dappled—
here and not here. He is a thrush hidden in the sage.
3. Does your child have excessive fear of noises? Does he cover his ears frequently?
With wind there are moments—agonies. Like the time
we found him covering his ears in a cement sewer pipe
during a storm or when he fled into the street, shocked
by the vacuum. Often we hold him hard to keep the world
from flooding in. Often the world is sirens.
4. Does your child seem like he is in his own world?
We mourn him daily. And yet he guides me by the hand
through the threshold of his room as one guiding someone
just off a train, gently and lightly, avoiding the gap between
the platform and the track. The heat from his hand,
combustion-warm. Old stove in which we’ve heated this house.
5. Does he lack curiosity about his environment?
Because the color of the red door renders it mute.
Because the color of the die-cast car is an empty blue
and the sound of our voices could be any possible starling
we are not here. He is not here. And what of the place you reside
if you don't reside in it? Where then does your body blink?
6. Do his facial expressions not fit situations?
Nulled into a thick disquiet. Mouth agape.
Agate of the eye catches quick the inseam and
no blemish. No, no turning away and no smile.
The contraption shuts its winking gap.
7. Does he cry inappropriately? Does he laugh inappropriately?
A soothing so honed it does not surface
or salvage the daily losses. Which are also sharp
vibratos of hums along the jawbone—the music’s
arrowing shot into the thalamus. A strobe’s command
and call. A conspiratorial ache.
8. Does he have temper tantrums? Does he overreact when he doesn’t get his way?
He is a dark and stabled bull kicking at the chained gate.
9. Does he ignore pain? For example, when he bumps his head, does he react?
If it strikes you can’t rescind it. Juncture to
the brain. Sharp cortical hurt into which
leap charges—synapse to synapse, but then a what?
A question asks its question. A hurt insists and yet.
10. Does he dislike touch? Doesn’t want to be held?
There’s something about proximity. The dutiful
belonging of atoms and how we relate
the world through our skin. The exposed parts
of ourselves and how those pavilions are brushed by
a plum tree’s wicked thorns.
11. Does he hate crowds? Does he have difficulties in restaurants and supermarkets?
Everyday he’s praying through the meanwhiles.
The sequences of. Not just aflutter, but alone
he sits on the periphery. Ears beside his little body.
12. Is he inappropriately anxious? Scared?
To soothe, the sound of humming through teeth. And so
a symphony of fears. The ventricular outbursts pleat
the clouds. The sky is always exploding
and in that delirum, a curdled tone.
13. Does he speak the same to kids, adults, or objects?
Remind us of our asymmetries. Who is that again? And what
smile to let the darkness in? I see him speak to the man
in blue work clothes and the way his face yields to
the light. To the way moments like this explode.
14. Does he use language inappropriately? (Wrong words or phrases).
The world is a network of minds. Think
of the tongue and the fibers that make
its muscles. The branching capillary network
enmeshed. Alive and cooled with a song
that slides away. Tongue jammed in its stirrup
thinking of itself and the blood red
amanitas pushed out of the earth.","The book is based on a series of questions asked of parents of children with developmental disabilities. The questions ask whether their child has poor eye contact, excessive fear of noises, or a lack of curiosity about his environment."
Pantoum Beginning and Ending with Thorns,"After Reena Saini Kallat’s “Woven Chronicle”

The Lengths,"The chain link fence divorced two worlds           the dying St. Augustine under corpulent live oak                      the alley that paralleled Bonita Boulevard

Your Biome Has Found You,"And who will kiss open
the spine of the resurrection fern
hunched like a widow, like a shamed child?
How it locks and hides and browns
under the sun—a laborer’s hands
picking blistered tomatoes
or a pile of bones, perhaps
bird bones—small, dry, silent.

Here is the damp and thickest marsh
of your interior wetland. And here,
your tundra of moss, rock, and shrub.
Here is the thing you lost,
perhaps the saddest or loveliest thing
—remember? It was suddenly taken—
as a fish spine is plucked from
its open body on an open plate.

You are helpless and wild here,
a murmuration of starlings in your chest.
Cicadas scream petrified from treetops.
The feral sounds of wilderness
sharpen your teeth.

It is November. Goldfish scales crunch
under your soles, the autumnal scent
of a fire inhales you, the aerials come and go.
Adding up all the dead things you carry,
you realize there is so much dirt in you.
Still, your nautilus ears listen, waiting
to hear your native sea.","The poem was written in the autumnal months of November and December. It is set against the backdrop of a wetland, a tundra of moss, rock, and shrub, and a pile of bones."
Abuelo’s Garden,"Bendito, 
bendito, 
bendito sea Dios
los ángeles cantan y alaban a Dios

Memories of my grandfather’s garden come back to me 
differently than other child of the hood memories
Memories of my grandfather’s garden come back to me
in well water voices 
in deep chest hymns
that begin as a gurgle deep in the belly and rise to the throat
slowly
I remember little of the day my friends jumped me in
I remember fists flailing and afterwards 
those deep, fleshy embraces 
only Latinos know how to give
but grandfather’s garden comes back to me with aromas, with tastes
with corridos sung to the sun
and novenas sung to the moon
thanking both sides of life 
the light and the dark
for their bountiful harvests
Ay, Dios mio,
all those nights we knelt together in brown earth
it was always about harmony, about balance
He’d intone deeply thanking the life-giving soil for its gift
and I’d follow suit
carefully pulling up cilantro, manzanilla, yerba del manso
always making sure metal spade never touches fragile root
sweet, ancient Abuelito, 
how could I be anything but a poet after those moments we shared
Don’t you see,
In my grandfather’s garden 
chiles grew
In my grandfather’s garden 
children grew
In my grandfather’s garden 
poems rose from the earth
like the twisted arms of la llorona desperately reaching out 
for her missing children
In my grandfather’s garden all of these things grew
slowly
because beautiful things take time to bloom
In my grandfather’s garden all of these things would rise 
slowly
like well water voices 
like deep chest hymns 
that begin as a gurgle deep in the belly and rise to the throat 
slowly singing
always singing

Leaves Like Prayer,"This is what leaves like a prayer:

"Dear David,","When I write to you now I write
to one who has left the here for
the beyond. That’s the future, as you know
better than anyone. In the past, that rainbow
zigged across your face, your eyebrows absent
and so your eyes in their sockets went
unsheltered, direct and uncanny. I can remember
myself most clearly when I remember
how unnerving, how the gaze from behind the paint
loosened the strength of what I thought I knew.
All collapsed now, total blam blam.
Each new face effacing the last, a kind
of courage, I think now, an offering and
a refusal at the same time. And why would you
regret any of it? The trick was to give it away,
but not all of it, the unspent light drawing us
to you, to what you sang, with a gravitational pull.
Whatever that secret was, it keeps telling itself.

Ode,"The white horses by the lake lift their heads
to see whose feet make a plodding tattoo
on the road: mine, dear white horses:
I’m advancing a hypothesis that I can run,
even as my years advance, adding
evidence to the brief against
my ineluctable decline.
White horses, gleaming across the damp,
across riparian grasses and untidy trees—
dear pearl of the sky, with belled canopy
and sheen, I stop to take a photograph
of the horses, using the rule of thirds to frame it—
more a rule of quarters, to capture more sky—
I love you more even than white horses
in the rain, constant but not somehow
insistent, beading my hair and needling
my shirt. Birds in transit, if these were my waters,
I could name you; still, I watch you move
from ground to sky, the cloudy corridors
and vestibules for your traverse, and
watching you, for once the world feels
reasonable, knit of many skeins but
of similar weights, as you purl
the cumulonimbus, drawing the sky
nearer, though only when I half-say it,
turning an idea of the unreachable
familiar. Your gray bellies mirror the crowns
of the oaks and alder, and in your unseen
fingers combing the leaves, I see
that you too are stirred by something
invisible, the only evidence being that drift,
like the little breath of cold air that seeps in
around the edges of an old window:
the soft inhalation of a mover, I think,
for no reason except I like it, a name
for that breath other than equations
someone has devised to describe it,
dear space I hold open against all evidence:
the ones who have passed before me
are nowhere to be seen, I hear no trace
of their speech, no matter how I figure
what is above me: trees not yet aflame,
your blossom just finished, I won’t
be here in autumn when the cold
will set color in your leaves, fire
that burns but does not consume:
and thus I won’t hear draw not nigh hither,
put off thy shoes, though I am always
prepared for a thing to be holy.","I love you more even than white horses, I think. Birds in transit, if these were my waters, I could name you; still, I watch you move from ground to sky.

Sleep Hygiene,"A bed should be a tender slab, devoid of insects.
A tired woman should be able to lie across diagonally,
headache to hag feet.
A bed should exist in crystalline silence.
It should have a sleepy blue view.
A nearby window not close to voyeurs.
A bed should have a special pillow to shush the head,
to coddle and safety the amygdala.
If established on the ground, a bed should have
a bioluminescent quilt to redirect the gaze: the prey
is over there.
If established in a tree, the quilt may allow for free feet
or a tossback with luxuriant abandon.
Among other things, do not build your bed on dictionaries
or books of any kind.
A bed is best made from a wood frame, or metal, or dark matter.
A bed should be free of lye, lime, and liars.
One should be able to enter the bed and think
I could fly far away in this. I could die; I could just die.","A bed should have a special pillow to shush the head,                to coddle and safety the amygdala. A bed should be free of lye, lime, and liars."
Oregon State Hospital,"Roberto Cabrera performs his Protactile poem “Oregon State Hospital”
translated from the Protactile by John Lee Clark
Wandering in the museum
I came across a woman’s story.
Let us conjure her up
in the form of a fist.
First, they knocked her head
and they said, Tsk-tsk.
Next, they zapped her
and they said, Huh.
Next, they shone lights in her face
and they said, Phooey.
Finally, they bored a hole here
and another here.
Her head tilted gently to the side
and they said, Aha.",Roberto Cabrera performs his Protactile poem “Oregon State Hospital’s” “Aha.” The poem is about a woman who was taken to a hospital. The poem was translated by John Lee Clark.
Stability Is a Feeling,"a found poem: The Unabridged Journals of Sylvia Plath
I am doing nothing with my exile
of a life.
I go to the supermarket Saturday
on walks in the wilderness
of America on Sunday. I get thin.
I encourage the man I married
to work hard
at a career I don’t admire.
He is not sweet or funny.
He is as steady and strong as death.
I find myself horrified
of the future; the woman I want to be
is implausible. Voicing
my tender ideas is not possible.
The book of poems inside me
is desperate for morning.","The Unabridged Journals of Sylvia Plath is a collection of poems written by Plath. The book of poems inside her is desperate for morning, she writes."
Heretic,"When you sang your body invented us
     an alphabet. No one heard it
          but me.
The earth in your eyes
     is the ink in your words.
          Each look writes another line.
Everything I need to know grows wings
     and lands on my skin.
          A thousand tiny plovers
cover the skies, and shine
     like moonlight on us both,
          turning us into your verses.
Last night each dot and curve of the letters of our alphabet
     came to rest on my body while I slept,
          entwined around my hips,
pulled their fingers through my hair.
     I breathed them in. Became the song
          you sang me.
You spell the morning prayer
     uttered by my lips.
          Syntax of attention
at the back of your throat. Each rise in note
     is your hand on my ribs.
          You hold me and no one can see.
Our unholy wholeness hides.
          Your name in the nearness. Says listen.
                    Sentences of rebellion
in the starless night.","When you sang your body invented us, no one heard it but me. The earth in your eyes is the ink in your words. You spell the morning prayer uttered by my lips."
Winter of Tumult and Artifact,"Again I navigate to the throat of the ocean for audible 
guidance and to acquire primitive details from the fraught 
plummet and slender horizon: a chain link, a stained
Bible. I make peace with the innocent wielding. At the edge— 
a teaspoon, a sandal. A shearwater circles without anger
and lightens, its wide wings, imperial, spread over
the repetition of distance. The wind leaves its motion
in filigreed sand, while out at the midpoint, an elliptical 
brooding. The water is full of itself and going nowhere
every twelve hours, and I might be the only one
to believe it or to be frightened. It commingles its salt
with lost objects and spits out a metal button, the hook
of an earring. The holy knife of water slices
further. Not that this could be simplified to the in-
out of action, the efficient carving of portions. Not
that anything is all farewell and return. Or all hunger.
Every time I capture a hollow bleached bone, a yawning 
plastic bag, another token, who says there is focus?
The grim light splashes up on me daily as I find
the remnants of strangers—a small tin, a key
still almost magenta. So it is pure reason to tend the endless 
wealth given by a thousand angles of light as water
dances the riptide. Every day an epiphany of loosening 
tedium. Out of the ocean’s sleek windows,
every vulnerable object seems to surrender. What I clutch
is only a resemblance of yesterday’s losses claimed
by the ocean’s euphoria, now docked in the slack at the shore. 
The cold is still luminous and preening. In the end,
there is no end if you stand long enough beside it.","Every day I capture a hollow bleached bone, a yawning                 plastic bag, another token, who says there is focus? The grim light splashes up on me daily as I find remnants of strangers. So it is pure reason to tend the endless wealth given by a thousand angles of light."
From “Sister Tongue”,"Noosh-e joon. 
I tell the chef of the house how delicious her food is, and she says back, Noosh-e joon. A blessing that goes deep—a giving back of more than just the meal. 
Noosh-e joon. I say it now. Sometimes I just say it in my head, because I know the person eating my food doesn’t know what it means. But I mean it. It comes without me ever learning it literally. It comes from wanting to keep the gratitude in the open, not shy. 
I want to explain: 
It has little to do with, So kind of you to say. It’s close to, You’ve tasted my love and given it back to me. I give it back again. I deposit it deep inside you. I knew all that before I ever had to ask. I even knew it when I pronounced it wrong, said, moosh, a word for cute, because I could tell how sweet it sounded. I learned it before I learned it. When I say it now, I want to say it raw, I don’t want to stop myself, even though I often do. I am intimate. I want to sound like all my aunts who ever said it to me: Hear my love in your ears, swallow it.

Like the Wolf,"Deployment Day 220
Most days are rice and radish,
the roiling of bones in a slick broth.
They are matchsticked carrot,
picked cilantro, the clean
blade of new onion.
Those days are lamb,
and piglet, the sleeping 
nose of spring suckling 
in new green. They are days 
when I fall asleep 
warm in our bed,
as the season thunders
softly to itself.
Others are nothing
but hunger, and the world 
becomes a tufted ear, 
a sprouted fang,
a desire to devour
children, grandmothers,
a huntsman whole.
Without the bone, there is no
soup. Without the soup,
only the gnaw of you
one ocean, another continent
away, and not answering
the phone. It is the held
breath, the way I must not
huff it out, instead howl
solemnly in the empty
night. When the skin comes
crawling off me—in a dark
bar, on a back porch,
tucked deep in white down—
I don't know how to fill
what teethes inside.
To be made of something
as cold as stone.
It's okay. I'm beginning
to learn that what I cannot 
blow down
will still burn.","Most days are rice and radish, the roiling of bones in a slick broth. Others are lamb, piglet, the sleeping                 nose of spring suckling                 in new green."
Skins and Bones,"Deployment Day 150
Halfway through October and I have lost
hope of autumn, everything still the green
green green it was when you left. 
I wonder if this will be another year
of wind and banshee flame as I wait
for rain in the endless blue. I want to say
I can bear this, but I wear your absence
in my face, in the way my skin crawls off
in the night when you’re asleep in a cold
country, dreaming no doubt of something
warm. Here our cat stopped eating 
six days ago, her haunches peaked
and sharp on my lap, where she circles
herself to sleep. Each time I wonder
if she’ll wake. But she is as warm 
as this month, and soon she thrums
against my thigh. We are saying a sort
of goodbye each day, when she looks 
at me and I am all the heartbreak 
a body can hold. We say skin and bones
but nothing of how big the eyes become, 
how wonder and starvation are twin. 
I try to call you to say this. There is nothing 
but the trilling ring that calls out 
like a bird that forgot its season.","Halfway through October and I have lost hope of autumn, everything still green. Here our cat stopped eating days ago, her haunches peaked and sharp on my lap. We are saying a sort of goodbye each day, and I am all the heartbreak my body can hold."
I Buy My Monster Roses,"Though the people on the internet help too. 
They send money by pressing a small button 
on their screens. It would be disingenuous 
to claim all the credit—we can’t heal
or hurt alone. I sniff the tops of the rose heads 
like a newborn’s scalp—fresh skin and hair
only a few days picked. I try to arrange the flowers
on my bed, create a romantic scene 
like all the 90s rom-coms I still watch. I’m stuck
in the past, I know. I’m stuck in the present, 
I know that too. I thought the roses 
could be a cure, and maybe in a small way
they were, each petal I plucked so gently 
from the stems gave in to me. ","I thought the roses  could be a cure, and maybe in a small way they were, each petal I plucked so gently from the stems gave in to me.

We Never Stop Talking About Our Mothers,"Renee and I, hers—in the urn by her desk 
and mine—alive in an apartment forty minutes 
from here, probably watching a telenovela, frying 
plantains, texting me goodnight. Renee’s mother isn’t
really in the urn. She’s in the blue wall, 
the beach landscape painting, the dog 
barking at the unexpected, the jangle of silver bracelets. 
We are all carrying our mothers, and we are all better 
daughters with the dead. She tells me I am wise, 
and all I can think about are the moments of my unwiseness: driving 
and sipping margaritas from a water bottle, the bruise 
on my arm and taking him back. Her husband 
is away at the family cabin, and she is glad 
for the space. My husband doesn’t exist, and I am 
sad for the space I make my home in. I buy sunflowers 
and goat cheese, throw a dinner party for the ghosts. 
I don’t know Renee’s mother’s name to send a proper invitation.
I don’t know the names of the women in my family 
past my great grandmother. How will I call upon them
when it’s time? Will I call them Mary or Venus 
or Yemaya? I’ve yet to burn the palo santo, the sage. 
I want to leave behind a legacy of light. 
I want to leave someone better. ","Renee’s mother isn’t really in the urn. She is in the blue wall, the beach landscape painting, the dog. Her husband is away at the family cabin. I buy sunflowers and goat cheese, throw a dinner party for the ghosts."
Unspooled,"Sometimes I feel as if I’m undone, 
a big spool of yarn 
rolling down a steep hill and out into the street,
down the garbage-gathered drain. 
Other times, I’m standing in front of Ramon’s
apartment building in Mexico City. Remember
when I broke that bottle of Tequila Herradura.
It shattered in shards and slivers. 
¡Hijole, y fue uno de los Buenos! 
the doorman lamented, watching the smooth 
white liquid spill onto the sidewalk. Lost. 
I wonder what people would say about me 
as I fall and crash to smithereens. 
I want to laugh out loud when I see 
I’m as solid as a snow cone. 
As if I could be slurped up, tossed out or simply melt away.
As if I could be a sweetness craved, a crying child’s prize
on steaming summer days. 
Prescription: Wrap arms tightly 
around chest, imagine freshly baked challah, 
imagine a Friday night when you allow 
yourself to rest your shredded senses, 
and put on that white lace Brazilian dress. 
Do not think of shards, 
think instead of strong vigas, high 
ceilings, an unobstructed view 
of the Big Dipper, Leonard Cohen 
carrying your darkness in his secret chords. 
Sing Hallelujah. 
Sing Heneni 
I am here.","Sometimes I feel as if I’m undone,  a big spool of yarn rolling down a steep hill and out into the street, down the garbage-gathered drain.

Love Letter to a Burning World,"Southern California 2020
Praise the dark that covers us with ashes, 
this morning’s tears, reminding us why we cherish
the not-burning baby cry of awake, not heartbreak. 

Mom, I need a hug, please, 
I just can’t seem to do anything right. 
Raphael, the angel name, should we have birthed
a warrior instead, one who could fight the demons? 

I can’t say for sure I’m an addict but I’m doing too much.
He gets up, then decides he’d rather smoke, 
not feeling OK right now. 
I am twisted up, feel the same way. Not OK. 

No, son, what you are feeling are singed embers
after six months of shutdown. Broken glass. 
Murder after murder of men and women the color of your skin.
At traffic stops, in the dark, in bed, while jogging. Anywhere. 

Praise the path that brought you here today, a boomerang.
Mom, I can’t make it, I’m at the car repair, I need
to keep looking for someone who can fix this. 
The drop like we hear in music, I hear it in his soul. 

My face is wet as he leaves in a gust: 
I have to meet my friends at the demonstration, I’ll feel better.
More purpose. Do you kill a child by holding or letting go?
Ashes, ashes as he runs out the door. 

Doesn’t he know this is an emergency? 
Like the blare of fire warning, 
Pack your bags comes from the evacuation order.  

Today his voice searing into my chest. 
Praise his tears for crying with me. 
Praise the seat that holds me fast. ","Praise the dark that covers us with ashes. Praise this morning’s tears, reminding us why we cherish awake, not heartbreak."
Return of the Woolly Mammoth,"You rarely wore it,
though you yourself chose the color, midnight blue,
and knee-length cut. In derision you named it 
“the woolly mammoth,” pointing to its Pleistocene proportions.
Still at each sign of snow, I nagged you to wear it. 
The last time I saw you
you confessed you’d have to give it away.
“Not one more winter,” you swore.
Yet when you chose it once more,
were you thinking of me?
Last of its species, the mammoth was hunted 
to extinction.
In a different Ice Age, it took you down
under the cold waters
of the dam, and sure enough, kept you down,
sodden, for a month,
until you surfaced, found.
I like to think of you buttoned up,
and until the last
breaths, beats, 
its boxy bulk somehow
kept you unaware,
insulated from creeping cold discovery.","The last time I saw you                you confessed you’d have to give it away.

It Was Enough,"After the autopsy,

where you once played endless NBA games,
you chalking, me cheating 
the stations of Around the World.
Now you stay put. 
The winter light plays out 
under the driveway’s broken maple boughs
while I go over with the undertaker 
Mass card designs, casket models, prayer order.
Every time I stepped outside to say
hello and goodbye,
all I saw of the back seat
was your tautened feet
and thin legs, too thin, 
up to about your bony knees,
up to where the opaque windows hid you.
(Stretched straight, hardened like Christ’s
after the cross, I thought.)
All I would ever more see of you,
naked, swaddled 
in the plush magenta funeral blanket.","After the autopsy, the plan was a simple transfer from that table to the funeral parlor. But I wanted you home,  a place you couldn’t seem to reach. The station wagon fire-red hearse parked under the basketball court."

Half a savage, half a child.”

And smack their lips on storied sin.

Beloved diary!
Come, let us make enquiry,
Is that all these Philistines can know?
Then let the true and tragic tale begin,
Of that and this,
Right well I wis,
None ever heard
These say a word. 
Of this, the horror that I knew,
The serpent grief that coiled and threw
Its small, glittering eyes on me,
Green and snaky eyes that held
All my will, and me compelled
To the numbing misery
Of some fascinated bird—
Of all this,
Well I wis—
Never a word! 
Of this the hooded snake that drew
And watched me circle round and round,
Of how I fluttered, fell, and flew
Frantic spaces from the ground;
Of the singing in my ears,
Hideous clamour, mocking jeers,
Of the devastating fears,
Dear and familiar things unheard,
Of the awful hope deferred—
Oh, well I wis
Of all this—
Never a word! 
Of the hidden, dull despair,
Of the grievous lassitude,
Of the crowning horror where
Blossomed love and plenitude;
Of the odious, choking shame,
Dissimulation, anger, blame,
Embarrassment, I overcame,
Of ridicule, mistakes absurd,
Of all this,
Well I wis—
Not a word! 
Of all the anguish borne in secret,
Loss of trust in God and Man,
Of the great ambition shattered,
Budding hope and darling plan;
Of the soundless wind and rain
Beating on the window-pane;
Of the untruths told in vain;
Of the voiceless bird and beast,
Of the songless, laughless feast,
Of the mind to madness spurred,
Never a word! 
Of life’s last keen extremity,
Fear of laughter, fear of pity,
Of the death that would not smite,
Of my heart pierced—uncontrite,
Living, thrilling, mad-to-live,
Quick, ceremented, splenitive,
Broken heart!

arroyo, a big cottonwood that I once saw twitch
with an owl, voluptuous, who dawdled until I was directly under
pillar and leaf, then repeated its wings and was off 
with a vision of other fault planes,
pulses. When I come out here, I give up
all the fictions of the nation. I can taste evidence of silence

verdigris loneliness, which is maybe the comfort I’ve best lived with
as normal. Where the desert bakes its stones
to old oaths, it is easy to count all the conclusions
as seduction. Right-sized, half-forward. Coming here
means I can see if the tree is blue with raking shadow, star limbs
and leaf-taking today. Means landing. Dreaming. 
I don’t know if this is proof
of mortality. But I’m whistling. The end is always near but every future 
has been forgotten. I was a happy girl. I remember so little.","When I come out here, I give up all the fictions of the nation. I can taste evidence of silence and hold my thought. Just me and an unruffledverdigris loneliness, which is maybe the comfort I’ve best lived with."
Oak Skin,"Every wood I’ve stepped into

manage to bruise me, test the calluses I’ve grown
with each stride I’ve taken through these trees.
I’ve sung to her beneath the arms of the beeches
reaching towards the birches, though she never
listens to me. I imagine she laughs at the tune
I cannot keep, before moving on, gathering weeds
by the stars, mixing potions to use on people
like me, who would walk into her arms gladly,
wishing she were an old aunt I could visit to learn
everything about this world she keeps to herself.","Every wood I’ve stepped into has a watchful crone, a witch whose skin resembles the bark of an ancient oak.

Make No Apologies For Yourself,"Dear You,
Make no apologies for yourself
Because you are covered in a listening skin
Because every ache you feel is not your own
Because of the lynching tree
Because of how many rivers they crossed
Because of the bowl of sorrow your mother carries

Because when you enter bookstores
books fall off of shelves into your open palms
Because you ask questions of the universe
the world opens before you like a page
Because of those clouds, and that murder of crows
Because poets are your wounded idols
Because the truth even if it hurts, it is to be cherished and held
and just because people die
does not mean they don’t walk with you daily
Because the river has a mouth that speaks their names
Because the river flows with stories
Because you sit on the shore and listen
Because alone is more comforting than being together
Because your pen is oceanic
Because you are big-eyed and eyes wide
Because you suffer from what you see and hear
Because you have sinus arrhythmia
You know your heart is linked to your breath
and your breath is short,
Because asthma is one of the monkeys on your back
Because your heart is the vehicle you chose to ride this go round
Because it can go forward and backwards in time
Because bookstores have always been oracles
Because poetry is your greatest archeological tool
Because you dig and you dive
Because you plummet if you cannot swim
Because you trust the ride of journal and journey

The Music of Beauty,"To me thy lips are mute, but when I gaze
Upon thee in thy perfect loveliness,—
No trait that should not be—no lineament
To jar with the exquisite harmony
Of Beauty’s music, breathing to the eyes,
I pity those who think they pity me;
Who drink the tide that gushes from thy lips
Unconscious of its sweets, as if they were
E’en as I am—and turn their marble eyes
Upon thy loveliness, without the thrill
That maddens me with joy’s delirium.","I pity those who think they pity me; who drink the tide that gushes from thy lips. To me thy lips are mute, but when I gaze upon thee in thy perfect loveliness, I am dazzled."
Necromancy for the Bitter,"I planted a coast live oak seedling
in the front yard today,
not with my own vestigial hands, 
but through the sentinel, pallbearing palms
of an able-bodied surrogate.
I can see it now, six inches tall and
stolid against the gentle breeze—
a pittance of cupped, spiny-toothed
leaves dangling from a stem curved in
proud contrast to my corrected scoliosis.
Long after my ventilator is sent to palliate
another among the unfortunate dying
and my lungs are but dust
on a slagged pair of Harrington rods,
the little oak might be a three-foot whip,
battered but not broken by the ephemeral desert breath
that creeps over mountains named by the Spanish for
some saint that never kept their end of the deal.
If drought holds off for a year or three
and my oak escapes the quirks of fate,
one day it might spread and thrive

the bare feet of a child or passing Pomeranian

If Being a Man Allowed for Emotion,"...it would be like hearing the grass grow 
or the squirrel’s heartbeat, and we should die of that roar 
which is the other side of silence  —George Eliot
My mourning is quiet, stealthy like the pause 
before bad news. An inherited trait near as I can
tell. All the men in my line are instinctually stoic & 
hidden—brackish bodies, damned at the gates. 
My last uncle just passed away, also of cancer, 
and with my brother Tyrone I discuss this too as inheritance— 
annual X-rays to hunt what would prey on us.
Memories surface of fishing trips
and nickel poker, except my grief has substituted
his face for Tyrone’s and dad’s for mine. 
What am I if not mane,
if not king,
     if not crown & control
& grass-shadow-eyes hidden?
My son’s first time sinking a hook in ocean water 
was with him just a few months ago and we split 
a can of High Life and hovered over the entrails 
of a sausage sandwich and laughed
at everything and he was the last of his brothers 
and the closest thing to seeing dad again—I breathe 
deep and slow like a big cat when blood is in the air
or ground, drop the phone on the bathroom floor,
slide down the wall against the shower door
like an avalanche crashing down a glass mountain,
head cupped in open palms & become a prayer 
built on bad knees, become swinging
jaw—unhinged, become throttle & throat &
roar,
            remembering my pride.","George Eliot: My mourning is quiet, stealthy like the pause  before bad news.

Like Prophets of Baal,"We had gotten a whole hog
from Aulander, pink-fleshed

to cover sin, which is belief

we can eat.
I walk around the offering 
before the body is pulled.
The men maneuver flame
and smoke seems to follow me
no matter where I go. Dad is gone
to tend the fire.
My uncle motions the bag toward me,
peels it from the bottle’s mouth like 
a fast-moving rain cloud. It burns sweet
on my finger. I look around nervous [the way 
            I would years later when the homeless man 
            outside 7-Eleven returned with Mad Dog, OE,
            and something for himself].
That’s good stuff, my uncle says, and I nod
in belief, face contorting into an amen.
But it burns. It burns
like the split-open swine on cinder-block.
See! How the smoke follows our gods
like eyes of a portrait, an heirloom.
The men walk in their own ritual
of pretense, ignoring whole conflagrations.
My uncle ignores hole burns in his chest. 
Just like Dad. [One day I’d beg Uncle Skin

flesh, his lung is smoking in the pit,

A Prayer in Signs,"No uttered word is ours—no solemn tone

No eloquence of meaning, borne along
   Of voice and accent, meet the God on high.
But dare ye tell us that we do not pray—
   We who so truly “lift up hands of prayer,”
And by the speaking gesture mark the way,
   Our heart’s desire would take to reach Him there?
“Our Father!” that appealing gesture lifts.
   With force more potent than the spoken word,
Desire, petition for the precious gift
   Held in the hand of One All-Seeing Lord.
“In Heaven!” we picture in the circling sweep
   Of arm and hand, the glorious dome above;
“Holy Thy Name!” with reverent movement keep
   The sacred thought of purity and love.
“Thy Kingdom!” with imperial touch we show.
   The badge of royalty—the sceptre’s sway;
And that Thy glorious Will may work and grow
   Potent and perfect, this and every day.
Our opened hands with daily bread to fill
   The Lord we ask, “Forgive as we forgive”:
O hearing brothers! We are like you still—
   The hardest this to pray, and this to live.
From tempter’s touch, whene’er beside he stands—
   We pray Thee still our weakness to defend:
And by the symbol strong of broken bands
   We crave deliverance, succor, to the end.

“The Glory”: rays of brightness seem to shine
   And scintillate around us, sweet and long.

   Nor join us in our glad and grand “Amen”?","No uttered word is ours—no solemn tone. No eloquence of meaning, borne along along with voice and accent. But dare ye tell us that we do not pray?"

with unicorns that honk as they twine around each other with languorous etc.

What though she talk of Homer’s Faust,

Your singular, my love. Rehearses its absence.
You see light, hear noise, feel the warmth of the sun. Do you connect it into “day”?
You move through shards and splinters. Toward.

Because, my love. The night such a vast space. And you a bird in oblique flight.
I try to hold on. To moments still ours. Even as they slip away.
Each word of yours, each gesture, gently. Once upon no more.
Do not fall again. Not even like an apple in autumn.
3
Because we say: we. We are each hour and each minute. Not altogether alone.
I have looked deep in the eyes of men and women. And feared that lastly. We make no contact.
And yet. The space between.
Can fill with love.

About you. A hunger hallucinating outward. From the ruins of memory.
Because yes, you. Still make my heart beat.
Irregularly. Like yours.",The poem is written in the form of a series of letters. The letters are written over a period of a few weeks. The author writes that he and his wife are not alone in their love.
"[Backlit by the glitter-chopped horizon,]","Backlit by the glitter-chopped horizon, each of these 17 Marbled Godwits poking at the tideline must have a heartbeat; every living, perfect Whimbrel, its eyes. The surf is stacked, tilted, as if it were higher than the beach. There is an urgency to turn home, get this assignment of pleasure done, strike it off the list where vanish will be the last task, and then there is the thought of those 17 hearts. Less rain means more salt, anchovies, more whales—a ferment to savor against a distant cloud of Shearwaters above the incessant upwelling.","Each of these 17 Marbled Godwits poking at the tideline must have a heartbeat; every living, perfect Whimbrel, its eyes. The surf is stacked, tilted, as if it were higher than the beach."
The Dustbowl,"       The Harvey Girls invaded Kansas that spring of the famine
nudged by sweet memories of cornfields in the snow.
       Okie weeders. Stranded in the orchards. Huts. Silos.
         Ah, the times they had—huts—racing down avenues
of rattly stalks, droopy and sere, oooo-eeee! roughhousing
       in jeans and poke bonnets until the laundry basin
         announced supper (thwacked) beans and jello (thwacked)
followed by coupling in the sheds. Alas that winter of the famine
       there were no sheds, and still they stayed, sullen
         girls of the south, squinting at yellow skies
out of verboten shacks. Alas that summer of the famine
       they breakfasted on leaves from gullies
         and the air tasted of acorns, ah, the meadows smelled of vanilla.
Alas that winter of the famine, their men lay down on the highways,
       and their women lay down with them, and felt the hot truck wind.
         Alas ladies in the cities, clutching their scalloped hankies,
oiled up the icy sidewalks in the violet dusk
       and hitching up their leather garments, fell and sued.
         Taxes. Caverns. Cereal. Vegetate. Simple gestures
(entering attics, bikes wobbling, dogs sunning)
       lurched into something checkerboard, with every piece
         outsized, gummed to attract the police.
The Harvey Girls slept until came the spring of the glut.
       Thrumming, the weed machines released an ebony menace.
         That summer of the glut, the fields were like monsters in heat,
and the Harvey Girls, freckled and worn, smiled at the northern mistral,
       and headed on mules for the mountains, that autumn of the glut.","The Harvey Girls invaded Kansas that spring of the famine. Stranded in the orchards. Huts. Silos. The girls of the south, squinting at yellow skies. They breakfasted on leaves from gullies and the air tasted of acorns."
Experts at Veneers,"“In Montana, claws skim through the dawn,
herders just saddle up, yes that’s it!
But then, they gulp hiccough pills in the highschools,
not to skip one ambiance in the tunnel of fun!”
  That symbiosis in the garden says to adventure.
The jelly on the daffodil will mildew by July,
and the orange result if the birds come by
will suffice as our capitol, won’t it?
       And I was there, and I was there.
  Here we are, in what seems to be an aerial predicament.
The Government certainly looks handsome in the mackerel sky,
awaiting wind fungus, beribboned in its way, goodbye.
Blackamoor stump, how luminous you’ll be.
       And I was there, and I was there.","The Government certainly looks handsome in the mackerel sky, says the writer. And I was there, and I wasthere. The Government certainly looked handsome in. the mackel sky, said the writer, but now it's gone."
Mother's Rules,"for my mother, Agatha Kamara
If you see me praying in the living room, never sit in front of me. You are not God.
  When we go to a restaurant and I don’t know any foods on the menu, never order me a meal that is spelled with silent letters. I came to eat, not to explore.
  You didn’t make food. No. God, did. You cooked food. Watch your English. Watch your faith.
  Your Krio is offensive. When you speak, you sound like Shabba Ranks. Your accent is funny, but keep practicing. It is the only way we will be able to gossip in peace while at the supermarket.
  Try to learn the language of your lover and his family. They could be smiling to your face and getting ready to trade you for 6 goats and 3 mules during your first trip to their homeland.
  If anyone stares at you for too long (more than 5 seconds), start speaking an imaginary language while maintaining eye contact. They will be the first to look away.
  Consider the consequence of purchasing human hair wigs, second hand clothing, and used furniture. Maybe you will feel beautiful, and also save money, but you never know whose bad luck or misfortune will be sitting on your head, body, or in the home in which you sleep. Buy what you can truly afford.
  Your father’s Muslim, so you are too (1989–1993).
I am Christian, so you are too (1993–2012).
I am Catholic now, but you keep praying (2012–present).
  You laugh at me now. Like I laughed at my mother. Like she laughed at hers. Like your daughters will laugh at you. And I will live long enough to forgive your folly.
  Just make sure to pray.
  Amen.","If you see me praying in the living room, never sit in front of me. Your Krio is offensive. When you speak, you sound like Shabba Ranks. Your accent is funny, but keep practicing."

five hundred years of tide,
near two thousand anvils of sunshine—

If it weren’t for us, you’d be living
calm as a dawn

seen through a lens, its ice flying apart

Breeding at the End of the World,"All the animals in my infant’s world 
are almost extinct. She is wrapped 
in a brown bear towel after I wash 
her in a bath shaped like a whale.  
What little I know of whales and mothering. 
A wide-eyed tortoise glows green into the night
making her room a starry starry night.  
A galaxy, a wonder world, 
her menagerie is full of mothers. 
The panda and her baby ball of cotton wrapped 
in matching flannel. The whale, 
another, hangs alongside a wash 
of nearly dead mammal mothers. They wash
over her as she gives into the night
hum of rhino, lion, narwhal,  
and giraffe spinning above her head. What world
am I leaving her? Each night I wrap 
myself in sheets and cry. Is this mothering?  
A baby elephant lays down to starve when its mother 
is killed. A baby polar bear washes 
itself in snow unaware of its melting. Wrapped 
around its young, an orangutan builds another night
nest to replace its stolen arboreal world. 
Statistics swallow me whole. She wails
into the dark that’s heavy as a whale’s 
sunken skeleton. My mother 
did not warn me of this sad sad world. 
We dream feed, both half asleep and washed 
in milk. It’s a marvel we survive each night. 
The morning heat slants through the room and wraps 
everything in prisms. She wakes and wraps 
her fingers around mine, spouts bubbles like a whale.
I kiss her toes with red wolf gnarls. My nightmare 
lingers. I whisper mama, mama 
to her nose and sing a Spanish song of colors to wash
away the troubles of this mundo.  
My tiny whale, how much I want the world 
to feel like home tonight. The sky washes
everything it touches, wraps us tightly like our mother. ","All the animals in my infant’s world are almost extinct. She is wrapped in a brown bear towel after I wash her in a bath shaped like a whale. They wash over her as she gives into the nighthum of rhino, lion, narwhal, giraffe."

The Star Dial,"Δέδυκε μὲν ἀ σελάννα
καὶ Πληΐαδες
          —Sappho
When the moon was high I waited,
   Pale with evening’s tints it shone;
When its gold came slow, belated,
   Still I kept my watch alone
When it sank, a golden wonder,
   From my window still I bent,
Though the clouds hung thick with thunder
   Where our hilltop roadway went.
By the cypress tops I’ve counted
   Every golden star that passed;
Weary hours they’ve shone and mounted,
   Each more tender than the last.
All my pillows hot with turning,
   All my weary maids asleep;
Every star in heaven was burning
   For the tryst you did not keep.
Now the clouds have hushed their warning,
   Paleness creeps upon the sea;
One star more, and then the morning—
   Share, oh, share that star with me!
Never fear that I shall chide thee
   For the wasted stars of night,
So thine arms will come and hide me
   From the dawn’s unwelcome light.
Though the moon a heav’n had given us,
   Every star a crown and throne,
Till the morn apart had driven us—
   Let the last star be our own.
Ah! the cypress tops are sighing
   With the wind that brings the day;
There my last pale treasure dying
   Ebbs in jeweled light away;
Ebbs like water bright, untasted;
   Black the cypress, bright the sea;
Heav’n’s whole treasury lies wasted
   And the dawn burns over me.",Sappho’s poem was written in the first half of the 19th century. It is titled ‘The Last Star’ and is written in a series of verses.

march through the streets of the seaside town
the lone envoy bearing a square yoke, parades
the wooden boat through narrow lanes
until nightfall, when the barge is brought
to rest upon a bed of joss (paper)
earlier that night, men load the boat
with hand-written wishes, the misfortunes
and plague of my past year to be piloted
up to the heavens in a blast of fireworks
deafening the crowd that came to bear witness
to ceremony; we observe as each of us does
some of us bail out before a thing is done
to escape our ghosts; we watch it burn;
I can’t unsnarl the knot of unmet needs,
so I sever it in heat, draw the cord into flame
to free myself from the clutch of haunting, to disembark
at the latitude of where I give up the ship ","R rites I enact are to set the world aglow with the light of desire, the fire of the mind.

Circus Nerves & Worries,"When that everybody’s legal twin Mrs. Trio
enters the casino, I expect personal disaster.
Out of next winter’s worst blizzard I’m convinced
into the lobby and up the ladder she’ll hustle
holding that squeaky velvet purse to one ear.
Placing one green and black peppermint-striped chip
gingerly on zero, zero it is. Which is when I fall dead.
In my shower while soaping. This very next year.
Goony intuition? Well, once in April at the Café Jolie
pointblank she asked: this terror at time in your eyes,
wouldn’t crossing a river help? How about now?
Give up my innocence hunt, I exclaimed,
intimacies with failure, all my “sudden magic” hopes?
And today came this dream about moths, I lied,
mouthing, yes wisdoms. Only how to read their lips? Tell me! Tell me!
I dream about vines, she said. Thank you and ciao.
Yesterday I looked at my body. Fairly white
Today fairly white, the same. No betterment.
Why can’t I feel air? Or take in mountains?
I lose my temper at pine needles, such small stabs.
Breezes scratch me (different from feeling)
and I long to breathe water. Agenda tomorrow:
cable her care of casino TIME TERROR GONE

Mashed Earth,"Nice how the sleep-inducing hum in the cracking walls
transforms soloists into service persons,
camouflaged as privet hutches in the gulch.
Outside the park part is: air.
Keeps ballooning in through old slit.
Signal for sod, more sod,
faceless sod, squashed,
long long while,
eroded rows.
  Not for a long long while
need the book-keeper at his desk in the clouds
stop gazing at the jigsaw fragments below.
Wondrous juxtapositions!
Quadruped nuzzles playground object.
All the while, seesaw,
dotted arches, heehaw,
grow bigger, bigger, biggest.
Dots pop.
Baby bumps start fooling around,
extremities say howdy,
arf and arf partner linkage thickens,
pretty lines lunge and play aerial possum,
forming pruned shapes:
          flapjack privates, ski slope privates.
          rosebud privates, oyster privates,
          rubbing against each other in the spring turmoil
          before sitting down to home cooking,
          in the garden,
          newspaper spread out under the spread.
Batman warbles:
A little moonlight’ll put sunshine in your life
to blonde tresses sucked upward
by fall through sky
off cliff.
Swoop and save,

Visual Radios,"The gigantic ghost scissors clacked away at the Olympic Team on the glacier, youngsters engrossed in their summer beverage. Screened by sandy lashes, their eyes vanished under their upper lids, up, up. Slick but not quite right—maimed buck look. But that’s what comes of years of flopping down anywhere, California-style, new professions zinging past, combinations and possible combinations that make you drool (gasp), aghast. Dumb come-on, none-the-less, to bank on the built-in climax that comes from realizing the death seizure is just a simulated orgasm moue.
Had to add screech-of-brakes, a shadowy forest for the secret police in black raincoats, alternating with white stone streets (parched Old World). One-to-one visual ratio teeters. The stone streets take over, shutters bang shut, doors slam like crazy, inside locks click. Some outrage no civilized person wants any part of is about to be committed. A monster must be loose.
Climbing into my bathrobe is like putting on a window—two windows, to be exact, one front and one back, a window with just enough give for one’s body contours, a window with regular panes. Blue sky view. It’s two (sundial). The bride has confetti in her hair and veil. The hippie groom must have a sweet tooth—he’s sneaking white icing into his mouth behind her back. In the distance, pyramids. Big statues of watchdogs form a circle around everything. So much vastness in one fell swoop, desert vastness, makes me want to cry when I look at it reflected, having, sandwiched myself between two mirrors.
Good. The maintenance men, rhinestone studs on their boots, monicker studs, are flushing out the feeder tubes with their mouths. The gland extracts should be coming through any second, front and back. The little teat wants more, more! Yaow! Ruff, ruff! Now its twin wants more too. Fair is fair, but, new feeder sequence inserted, they’ve packed up their gear. No more severed arteries today.
Shutters bang open, doors too. The whole slaphappy town is pouring out into the streets. Some delirium no civilized person would touch with a ten-foot pole has just been set into motion. The scissors must have savaged the monsters on the glacier.","After years of flopping down anywhere, California-style, new professions zinging past, combinations and possible combinations that make you drool (gasp), aghast.

Letter on Alladat,"            O these bonds packed with zeroes—harmony, grief, regrets. I’m done with memory. And every time I listen to your poetry, nausea becomes a river in me in which I swim naked, dispossessed.
            I’m making a fetish of everyone dead, my electrons black with heat and sound.
            O my thousand delicate microaggressions, bound up with a hunger I can never grasp. Keep me safe, erotic. Be a mirror to these movements of bourgeois frustration.
            In these wee early hours, know that it has become very hard for me to tell apart the odds on fornication from a staggering, and at times quite foolish, feeling of abjection; as such, my sex might as well have been written down in algebra columns.
            The following notes were written in prison, under forced labour, that is, in the dismal intervals and caesuras in which, to proclaim my virtue, I had to consent to being bludgeoned to death by pigs.
            I’ve yet to overcome. Indeed, I’ve been destroyed so many times my probationer, in anger and disgust, had to void each letter so as to weigh down what is meant by free on appeal.
            O my decadent counter-revolution. My beautiful mechanism. What matters most is not invention, force or calculation, but what it means to suffer the fate of failure, and to learn from it.
            (A mistake made by the struggle. As Césaire knew—only too well—modern revolt needs a black clarity of vision.)
            As for the wonder communicated by metaphor—I have spent many mornings watching a monkey open a cowrie shell.
            The scene reminds me of Landscape of a Man Killed by a Snake, but, on further reflection, the verses seem more intimately bound up with the Koran as read by Malcolm.
            We need to scribble an x on the walls of our collective resurrection. We need to let the right one in.
            (What worries me most about the absolute is that it has no depth, but is all surface.)
            To become zealous, indecent, as we bleed out at sunrise. For that is the contract. You can fuck all the rest.","The following notes were written in prison, under forced labour, in which, to proclaim my virtue, I had to consent to being bludgeoned to death by pigs.

Vote Your Way to Hell,"It’s a long and arduous journey.
Starving with numbness.
Tired of mixing kindness and sabotage.
You can’t trust instinct.
After the election, you can’t believe the weather is wrong again.
The sky cheats on your speech.
The process is complicated and precarious.
Disappointed, there’s no word of a sad sneer.
Nothing has changed.
What else do you expect?

from “. . . Again”,"We walked toward the zenith not expecting a new rising sun, but satisfied with the Cheese Whiz, Zebra Cakes, and Zingers at the end of the aisle at Family Dollar. Maybe eat them with Prozac or Zoloft. Later, take in the pine trees rising behind the cinderblock walls of the Dollar Tree. The American alphabet ends like every American factory ends. Zombies wandering around on Zoom. The new zoology. In the Ocean State Job Lot parking lot, I put the words “cheap America lot” into Business Name Generator and got these results: Balaclava America, Zip Cheap, Burb Lot. Nothing much more needs to be said. Maybe there will be more zebras someday. More songs by a reconfigured ZZ Top (you will or will not listen to them on Amazon music). But for now, there are intermezzos, piazzas, and paparazzi for the elites on their mega-yachts, on their spaceship trips into outer space. Meanwhile, the working class orders a pizza delivered by the working class. Zero tolerance for everything and everyone else.

Sonnet for Ochún,"After my left arm I washed my right, neck, décolletage,
and navel. I ate ground meat with large crystals of imported salt.
The women and men who would stroke my hair if I asked,
I thought of them fondly then sadly. At the flea market,
what I touched with a fingernail was a copper lamp, a mundane
painting of mountains, the cashier’s hum. I bought nothing I didn’t
want. In the cul-de-sac, I found clouds on leashes, loose roosters.
I thought thoughts ugly as clothespins. Reading a used book,
I suspected I knew less about death than the last person who held it.
I spat into a mirrored sink. I lost my slippers and face. To feel more
like water, I drank it. Before bed, I walked my plank of uncertainties
and plunged further into uncertainty. Am I capturing all of history
in this gesture? I shouted into the future. In the wet air of the future,
I could have but never appeared. No one was sorry but me.","The author spent the day washing his arms, neck, décolletage, and navel. He also ate ground meat with large crystals of imported salt. At the flea market he bought nothing he didn't want."

The needle this morning wavers indifferently

Impassive sky against your forehead blocking any chance of feeling eager,
But also dulling greed

The eightball’s icosahedron . . .
Am I even suited to this—
Writing to save your life—pushing on past every clumsy letter—
Hoping for a flower?

Poets and lovers ever more,
To laugh and dream on Lethe’s shore,
To sing to Charon in his boat,
Heartening the timid souls afloat;
Of judgment never to take heed,
But to those fast-locked souls to speed,
Who never from Apollo fled,
Who spent no hour among the dead;
          Continually
          With them to dwell,
Indifferent to heaven and hell.","Shakspear was born in April, and the world was on us, pressing sore. My Love and I took hands and swore, to be poets and lovers ever more, to laugh and dream on Lethe's shore."

Frets with its restless whirls this meagre strand.
And in the withered hollow of this land
        Hath Summer dug herself so deep a grave,
        That hardly can the leaden willow crave
One silver blossom from keen Winter’s hand.
But who is this who cometh by the shore?
(Nay, love, look up and wonder!) Who is this
        Who cometh in dyed garments from the South?
It is thy new-found Lord, and he shall kiss
        The yet unravished roses of thy mouth,
And I shall weep and worship, as before.","""The sin was mine; I did not understand. The yet unravished roses of thy mouth,                And I shall weep and worship, as before"""
Pilgrimage,"The arch of my foot aches.

Soon, we’re walking through nettles, a yellow paddock,

               fresh ginger packed between the gum

And tooth.

In excess, sugars become fat, a kind

               of sealant. Organs bleating

On the forest floor.

A first step.

Blue radiance, paper that receives ink, coffee with cream. By day 8,

               I can’t remember life

With my family.","By day 8, I can’t remember life with my family. The arch of my foot aches. Organs bleating on the forest floor. Blue radiance, paper that receives ink, coffee with cream."
Malice,"I have violence in me, of rage, and of necessity, and my love has none.

When pushed to it I would punch a man, or maybe wield a gun, but I am stopped by his pure disgust.

This is something new in me: I have sometimes wished death, where I hadn’t before.

While I wasn’t looking it left me, some of my tenderness, and in leaving something tensed where it had been.

Like A., praying for the man to get hit by a car who yelled at me so loudly, for so long, followed us to keep yelling.

There is malice in the world, and maybe some of it is ours now.

“Why should I cater to you” he said to me, so loudly, in my white high-waisted shorts and my clogs like my mom’s with my hair piled on top of my head, and this word, “cater,” it made me laugh.

Sometimes a poet can tell when a word is not a speaker’s own.

So that I could stop obsessing about this very possibility, I had practiced a response to yelling, and though I surprised myself by responding in exactly this practiced way of course nothing changed.

Language can be about force instead of relation.

When an experience is not really “about you” you can still be there, experiencing it.

“There are only two kinds of people,” he said, so loudly.

Maybe he’s right: maybe there are those who are violent, or who could be, and those who aren’t.

But the watermelon I bring home is yellow on the inside, and the melon my mother takes from the bin of smooth-rind honeydew is a cantaloupe.

This is not about fruit.

A poet is not inherently good.

It’s about how, at the end of the violence, I still want to know—what did it matter to him?","When pushed to it I would punch a man, or maybe wield a gun, but I am stopped by his pure disgust. I have violence in me, of rage, and of necessity, and my love has none."

Canto for the Chestnut-Eared Laughingthrush,"And then rushed into the embrace of the mountains
Of the Kontum Plateau, ferried through Lo Xo pass,
Blew past Măng Đen, dizzied among hairpin turns,
Floating in the lushness 1,200 m above sea level,
Amid a mosaic of prime evergreen, gasping.
And up there we saw: strata of emerald forms,
Of beech, laurel, magnolia, heather, and myrtle.
Under unbroken canopy, in the undergrowth
Of that species rich upper montane wet forest,
Hidden somewhere in that mystery must be
Our very own Chestnut-eared Laughingthrush.
Garrulax konkakinhensis was our day’s journey
And query, who appeared in our dreams calling.
So we began our search, checked known locations.
At the first spot, magpies. The next: babblers.
But we kept looking, listening, knowing the forest
Gives up its secrets slowly. And passion we knew
From experience associates with wild patience.
On our lips the other name, Khướu Kon Ka Kinh,
For the shy terrestrial bird who has no need for names,
But sustenance and song. Then came a rasping buzz.
Close by us, there in the undergrowth, a voice
Signed among the trees. A few turns of the
Kaleidoscope, new shapes and colors rearranged
Themselves into the winged creature we sought out:
Brown and black dappled, spotted, and speckled,
The chestnut patch brushed behind the knowing eye,  
Blurring well into the daylight world of shadows.
As if a slight breeze stirred, gentle movements
Among the leaves and branches told us our bird
Retreated out of sight. We all breathed again.
The laughingthrush exists. The mountain forest exists.
This was only prelude, for we struck deeper into
The interior seeking greater clarity, closer listening.
And so we stood like trees staring back into the trees,
Ears peering through the green abundance,
Touching the colorful cacophony of sounds.
Reader, desire follows you into the field,
Where what you want colors what you see.
On the road back to Pleiku, looking out across
The highlands that held us, we all smiled—
There was no need for words. Each replayed
In their mind’s eye the day’s loveliness.
Then came news of extinction. The Javan rhino
Dead, the last of his kind found slaughtered
At Cát Tiên, horn sawed off. Joy fell from the sky.
Let us not tell our children a story that begins,
Once in the forests there was a laughingthrush . . .
We had met with Chestnut-eared Laughingthrush
Again and again, there in the heart of the heart
Of the forest, there where our fellow humans
Had not cleared, hunted, trapped, and defoliated
Life out of existence. There sweet thrush-like notes
May stream yet as water over rows of stones.
Others there sang the songs of their species too.
And our bodies also lighter with laughter.",The Chestnut-eared Laughingthrush is a species of thrush. It is found in the Kontum Plateau in northern Thailand.

An’ de solemn marble statues o’er deir ashes vigil keep;
I would see immortal Milton an’ de wul’-famous Shakespeare,

I would see de ancient chair where England’s kings deir crowns put on,
Soon to lay dem by again when all de vanity is done;

Strokes of the Tamarind Switch,"I dared not look at him, 
My eyes with tears were dim, 
   My spirit filled with hate
     Of man’s depravity, 
I hurried through the gate. 

I went but I returned, 
While in my bosom turned 
   The monstrous wrong that we 
       Oft bring upon ourselves, 
And yet we cannot see. 

Poor little erring wretch!
The cutting tamarind switch
   Had left its bloody mark,
      And on his legs were streaks. 
   That looked like boiling bark. 

I spoke to him the while: 
At first he tried to smile, 
   But the long pent-up tears
      Came gushing in a flood; 
   He was but of tender years. 

With eyes bloodshot and red, 
He told me of a father dead 
   And lads like himself rude, 
     Who goaded him to wrong:
    He for the future promised to be good. 

The mother yesterday 
Said she was sending him away, 
   Away across the seas:
      She told of futile prayers
   Said on her wearied knees. 

I wished the lad good-bye, 
And left him with a sigh:
   Again I heard him talk—
      His limbs, he said, were sore, 
   He could not walk. 

I ’member when a smaller boy, 
A mother’s pride, a mother’s joy, 
    I too was very rude:

From the Stone Age,"Long ago some one carved me in the semblance of a god.
I have forgot now what god I was meant to represent.
I have no consciousness now but of stone, sunlight, and rain;
The sun baking my skin of stone, the wind lifting my hair;
The sun’s light is hot upon me,
The moon’s light is cool,
Casting a silver-laced pattern of light and dark
Over the planes of my body:
My thoughts now are the thoughts of a stone,
My substance now is the substance of life itself;
I have sunk deep into life as one sinks into sleep;
Life is above me, below me, around me, 
Moving through my pores of stone—
It does not matter how small the space you pack life in,
That space is as big as the universe—
Space, volume, and the overtone of volume
Move through me like chords of music,
Like the taste of happiness in the throat,
Which you fear to lose, though it may choke you—
(In the cities this is not known,
For space there is emptiness,
And time is torment) . . . . .
Since I became a stone
I have no need to remember anything—
Everything is remembered for me;
I live and I think and I dream as a stone,
In the warm sunlight, in the grey rain;
All my surfaces are touched to softness
By the light fingers of the wind,
The slow dripping of rain:
My body retains only faintly the image
It was meant to represent,
I am more beautiful and less rigid,
I am a part of space,
Time has entered into me,
Life has passed through me—
What matter the name of the god I was meant to represent?","Long ago some one carved me in the semblance of a god. I have no consciousness now but of stone, sunlight, and rain. I live and I think and I dream as a stone, I dream in the warm sunlight, in the grey rain."
I Have a Friend,"    I have a friend
And my heart from hence
Is closed to friendship,
Nor the gods’ knees hold but one;
He watches with me thru the long night,
And when I call he comes,
Or when he calls I am there;
He does not ask me how beloved
Are my husband and children,
Nor ever do I require
Details of life and love
In the grave—his home,—
    We are such friends.","""We are such friends,"" writes the poet. ""He watches with me thru the long night, and when I call he comes, or when he calls I am there"""

Dusk,"Twin stars through my purpling pane,

For the Candlelight,"The sky was blue, so blue that day
    And each daisy white, so white,
O, I knew that no more could rains fall grey
    And night again be night.
                    . . . . .                    
I knew, I knew.   Well, if night is night,
    And the grey skies greyly cry,
I have in a book for the candle light,
    A daisy dead and dry.","I knew that no more could rains fall grey and night again be night. The sky was blue, so blue that day. And each daisy white, so white."
The Marathon Runner,"If I have run my course and seek the pearls
My Psyche fain would drink at Mermelon
And rest content in wine and nectar cup
Who knows but that the gods have found me whole
And in their stewardship of man would bless
The sweating lover fickle man once knew?
I know that I might pull the tendon bands
That hold my soul together—ay, might bend
Each nerve and muscle spirit fain would keep—
That I might hear the maddening cheers of men
Who when the morrow dawns forget the games
And cast instead the dice in market place.
But I have found sweeter peace than fame;
And in the evening dwell on heights divine,
Betwixt my lips a rose from Cupid’s hands,
Upon my brow the laurel Belvidere
Entwines from tree beside the throne of Zeus
And flowing from my speech Athene’s words
Dipped long in wisdom’s fount to heal the soul.","""I know that I might pull the tendon bands that hold my soul together"" ""I have found sweeter peace than fame; I have found peace in my soul"" ""My Psyche fain would drink at Mermelon and rest content in wine and nectar"""
Puck Goes to Court,"I went to court last night,
Before me firefly light;
And there was Lady Mab,
On cheek a cunning dab
Of rouge the sun sent down,
King Oberon with crown
Of gold eyed daisy buds
Among potato spuds
Was dancing roundelay
With Lady Chloe and May.
I hid among the flowers
And spent the wee young hours
In mixing up the punch;
For I was on a hunch
That sober men are dull
And fairy dust will lull
To rest the plodding mind
Word down by life’s thick grind.
The nobles drank the brew
And called it sweetest dew;
But when I left they lay
Stunned by the light of day
And Oberon had writ
Decree that I must flit
A hundred leagues from court.
(Alas!   Where is there sport?)","I went to court last night, before me firefly light, with Lady Mab, and King Oberon. I hid among the flowers, and spent the wee young hours mixing up the punch.

When I Die,"When I die my song shall be
Crooning of the summer breeze;
When I die my shroud shall be
Leaves plucked from the maple trees;
On a couch as green as moss
And a bed as soft as down
I shall sleep and dream my dream
Of a poet’s laurel crown.
When I die my star shall drop
Singing like a nightingale;
When I die my soul shall rise
Where the lyre-strings never fail;
In the rose my blood shall lie,
In the violet the smile,
And the moonbeams thousand strong
Past my grave each night shall file.","When I die my song shall beCrooning of the summer breeze. When I die, I shall sleep and dream my dream of a poet’s laurel crown."
Devonport,"The man has chosen
that he wants his ashes scattered
from the end of the pier
where he used to fish with his buddies.
They’d sit on overturned paint buckets.
Sometimes the waves gusted up
and the hems of his pants got wet and salty.
He liked the gulls that stood on the railing,
all puffed up with sky.
Having made the decision,
he walks at dusk to the end of the pier
and looks out at the sea.
As he turns away, he sometimes gives
a small, happy nod, like a man
thinking yes, I will buy this house.","The man has chosen that he wants his ashes scattered at the end of the pier where he used to fish with his buddies. He liked the gulls that stood on the railing,                all puffed up with sky."

After Striving,"I think of my father’s one-room woodshop,
how his business sign eventually blew over
beside apple trees and blueberry bushes.
At church, men would ask, Staying busy?
He hated that question, and kept adding logs
to the stove and sanding doors.

and not think about the push mower.

"Dearly Departed, Again I Dreamt About a Ship","When a mouth aboard said ship
called out to me, I was a berry

neglect, an old ornament gone
unglossed. It spoke to me & warranted

I heard two crows, heard both.
For years, that strange whistle
of new language nettled me sloppily

holler too long untended, & after
too long an ignorance it came back
to beat me, a bullet of tenacity.

exactly this much effort to tell you

Star Ledger,"Almost time to dress for the sun's total eclipse
   so the child pastes one last face
in her album of movie stars – Myrna Loy
   and Olivia de Havilland – names meant to conjure
sultry nights, voluptuous turns across
   some dance floor borne on clouds. Jean Harlow.
Clipped from the Newark evening paper, whole galaxies
   of splendid starlets gaze, fixed to violet pages
spread drying on the kitchen table. The child whispers
   their names when she tests “lorgnettes”
made that morning out of shirtboards, old film
   negatives gleaned from her grandmother’s hat box.
Through phony opera glasses, hall lights blur
   stained sepia above her, and her grandmother’s
room is stained by a tall oak’s crown, yellow
   in the window. Acorns crack against asphalt
three floors down. The paper promised
   “a rare conjunction of sun and moon and earth.”
Her grandmother brushed thick gray hair.
   Cut glass bottles and jewel cases.
Above the corset her back was soft, black moles
   she called her “melanomas” dusted across
powdery skin like a night sky, inside out.
   The Spanish fan dangles from her wrist
and when she stands she looks like an actress
   from the late-night movies. The child sifts
costume brooches, glass rubies and sapphires,
   to find the dark gold snake ring with emerald chips
for eyes. She carries the miniature hourglass
   to the sagging porch, then waiting turns it over
and over. Uncertain in high heels, she teeters
   and the shawl draped flamenco-style keeps sliding off
her shoulder, so she glances up the block to Girl Scouts
   reeling down the flag. The child hates their dull uniforms,
how they scatter shrieking through leafsmoke and the sheen
   of fallen chestnuts. She touches the ring, heavy
on a ribbon circling her neck, then thinks she’ll sew
   the album pages with green embroidery silk.
Her grandmother snaps the fan and they raise lorgnettes
   to the sun’s charcoaled face, its thin wreath
of fire. Quiet, the Girl Scouts bow their heads – sleek
   Italian ones and black girls with myriad tight braids.
Streetlights hum on, then the towers of Manhattan flare
   beyond the river. The earth must carve its grave ellipse
through desert space, through years and histories
   before it will cross with sun and moon this way again.
Minor starlets in the child’s album will fade and tatter,
   fleeting constellations with names flimsy as
the shawl that wraps her shoulders. She’ll remember this
   as foolish. The girls by the flag will mostly leave
for lives of poverty, crippled dreams, and Newark
   will collapse to burn like another dying star.
But none of this has happened. Afternoon has stilled
   with the eclipse that strips them of their shadows,
so each one stands within their own brief human orbit
   while the world reverses, then slowly, recovers.",The sun's total eclipse will be visible in the United States on August 21. The eclipse is a rare conjunction of sun and moon and earth. It will be the first time in 100 years that the sun will cross the moon.

The Forest Road,"The forest road,
The infinite straight road stretching away
World without end: the breathless road between the walls
Of the black listening trees: the hushed, grey road
Beyond the window that you shut to-night
Crying that you would look at it by day—
There is a shadow there that sings and calls
But not for you. Oh! hidden eyes that plead in sleep
Against the lonely dark, if I could touch the fear
And leave it kissed away on quiet lids—
If I could hush these hands that are half-awake,
Groping for me in sleep I could go free.
I wish that God would take them out of mine
And fold them like the wings of frightened birds
Shot cruelly down, but fluttering into quietness so soon.
Broken, forgotten things; there is no grief for them in the green Spring
When the new birds fly back to the old trees.
But it shall not be so with you. I will look back. I wish I knew that God would stand
Smiling and looking down on you when morning comes,
To hold you, when you wake, closer than I,
So gently though: and not with famished lips or hungry arms:
He does not hurt the frailest, dearest things
As we do in the dark. See, dear, your hair—
I must unloose this hair that sleeps and dreams
About my face, and clings like the brown weed
To drowned, delivered things, tossed by the tired sea
Back to the beaches. Oh! your hair! If you had lain
A long time dead on the rough, glistening ledge
Of some black cliff, forgotten by the tide,
The raving winds would tear, the dripping brine would rust away
Fold after fold of all the loveliness
That wraps you round, and makes you, lying here,
The passionate fragrance that the roses are.
But death would spare the glory of your head
In the long sweetness of the hair that does not die:
The spray would leap to it in every storm,
The scent of the unsilenced sea would linger on
In these dark waves, and round the silence that was you—
Only the nesting gulls would hear—but there would still be whispers in your hair;
Keep them for me; keep them for me. What is this singing on the road
That makes all other music like the music in a dream—
Dumb to the dancing and the marching feet; you know, in dreams, you see
Old pipers playing that you cannot hear,
And ghostly drums that only seem to beat. This seems to climb:
Is it the music of a larger place? It makes our room too small: it is like a stair,
A calling stair that climbs up to a smile you scarcely see,
Dim, but so waited for; and you know what a smile is, how it calls,
How if I smiled you always ran to me.
Now you must sleep forgetfully, as children do.
There is a Spirit sits by us in sleep
Nearer than those who walk with us in the bright day.
I think he has a tranquil, saving face: I think he came
Straight from the hills: he may have suffered there in time gone by,
And once, from those forsaken heights, looked down,
Lonely himself, on all the lonely sorrows of the earth.
It is his kingdom—Sleep. If I could leave you there—
If, without waking you, I could get up and reach the door—!
We used to go together.—Shut, scared eyes,
Poor, desolate, desperate hands, it is not I
Who thrust you off. No, take your hands away—
I cannot strike your lonely hands. Yes, I have struck your heart,
It did not come so near. Then lie you there
Dear and wild heart behind this quivering snow
With two red stains on it: and I will strike and tear
Mine out, and scatter it to yours. Oh! throbbing dust,
You that were life, our little wind-blown hearts!
                              The road! the road!
There is a shadow there: I see my soul,
I hear my soul, singing among the trees!","I wish I could hush these hands that are half-awake,                Groping for me in sleep I could go free.

Castnet Seafood,"for Uncle Kenny and Cousin Jeremy
According to the local news station,
the blue crawfish is a rare thing to find,
yet it watches us from the tank of the market,
spared from a boiled, seasoned death
unlike its red friends. My uncle says joy
is the opposite of running
into a dagger, and I realize I am not
the most poetic family member
who has pain. J and I crack the spines of
the crawfish not lucky enough to be blue.
The deeper the blues, The more I see
black played above my head at the chiropractor
the day before. Stubborn I call my back,
subluxation the medical journal says.
Three times a week, my chiropractor
calls the forceful moving of my misalignment
a healthy crack. Like bullies hemorrhaging
power, we look forward to making me
almost break. I love my family, unlike my back.
Before we got here, J threaded amber and jade
and lapis into a necklace he made for me
to match the cover of the book where I’ve written
my pain. He moves, outside his box, newly freed.
He loves movement, says he understands 
that toxic masculinity means to want 
to pinch your claws around any smaller crustation.
I am the third most poetic in this family. He loves 
the neon of the crawfish. We google what makes it 
blue and we suck the sadness out of our conversation.
Like luck, blues can spare any life if you wear
it, but it will leave you as lonely as the crawfish
in the tank. I wonder what family the mudbug
came from. Were they a proud bunch? Had the brightest
shells in their swamp? Did this little blue bug love 
his looks, or did he burrow deeper into the mud 
because he couldn’t handle the attention his hue 
attracted? We chew the back meat of the unlucky things,
stew in the love that surrounds us like a pot with our
spines and heads still attached. Look at what the
brain makes the muscle do: remember. 
Joy is the membrane covering us, the tissue that keeps
a family situated around a table when they could
be running from one another. My uncle taps the murky
glass to make the orphaned thing move. He turns to us:
Could you imagine us living like that? 
All hard on the outside with an exoskeleton? 
No, no I can’t. There’s so much
in us. We’d fall apart.","The deeper the blues, the more I see black played above my head at the chiropractor. Stubborn I call my back, the medical journal says. My chiropractor calls the forceful moving of my misalignment a healthy crack."
Materials for a Gravestone Rubbing,"I have long wanted to be starlight in spring
and the late snow that lingers there, coming down
at Harpers Ferry over the river or gathered 
on a windowsill on third street in Brooklyn 
when I was twenty-two—the potpourri 
of sky the wind carries after a storm. 
The gray darkening on a far ridge. If you are reading this
there is still a way. I can take your smooth palm in mine
and lead you toward a distant city and a night
when you were on the mountain and dreaming of the other world
and we can walk together past the pre-war homes 
converted now to low-rent apartments for college students
or workers come in from long days on a road crew,
coveralls draped over the backs of kitchen chairs
and the light swaying just so. We can go on—
along the cracked sidewalks above the train tracks
that can’t exist again even as the grasses come up between them
and look through a fog and a single pair of headlights
making definite beams in the material cold. 
No moonlight to get netted up in on the surface of the water
no traffic at this hour just the scraps of paper blown
into gutters and the electric hum of streetlights,
a few voices, which almost walk like footfall down alleys
overgrown with briars and creeping vines, their crude
latticework against the brick and the exhale
of a bartender on a smoke break and the smoke
which still drifts. Now it must be all worn through
but then it was barely remarkable though I stop
to look back at the homes and at snow melt on roads
the flat glitter on the black road, the moiré pattern 
yet to be captured by language—and for a minute believe
in something as my stepfather believed in the smell of fire
whenever he left in the middle of the night
and returned before dawn and spoke to no one, didn’t
wake anyone up. Sometimes I feel that alone, 
that pure, as if looking back at myself
through the scrim of time and you are there 
standing in our kitchen at this hour and I can almost 
hear you and the first singing caught-up there in the back 
of your throat. Lately I’ve stopped worrying about the end. 
Each day my hand is smaller on your shoulders. New birds
still return and the hillsides green all around, the stars 
have traveled over the horizon and in the blink 
of an eye you are here—grape-vine charcoal in your hand;
little hyphen I have become.",If you are reading this there is still a way. I have long wanted to be starlight in spring. I can take your smooth palm in mine and lead you toward a distant city and a night when you were on the mountain.
"I’m Not Faking My Astonishment, Honest","Looking out over the cliff, we’re overwhelmed
by a sky that seems to heap danger upon us. We
end up staring at a single white fluff in the air—
feather, fur, dandelion puff—we don’t care
to define it. The relief of having something
to focus our attention. At home, our patio furniture
unscrews itself under the usual sun. On this trip—
well, I’m not any sadder, I just have more space
for my sadness to fill. I don’t want to give
particulars. A woman huffing up the trail behind
us says to her hiking partner, It wasn’t my size,
but it was only 9 dollars. And now all I want
is to see what it is. The future refuses
to happen, so where else should I turn?","On this trip, I’m not any sadder, I just have more space for my sadness to fill. A woman huffing up the trail behindus says to her hiking partner, It wasn’t my size, but it was only 9 dollars. The future refuses to happen, so where else should I turn?"
Winter Remembered,"Two evils, monstrous either one apart,
Possessed me, and were long and loath at going:
A cry of Absence, Absence, in the heart,
And in the wood the furious winter blowing.
Think not, when fire was bright upon my bricks
And past the tight boards hardly a wind could enter,
I glowed like them, the simple burning sticks,
Far from my cause, my proper heat, my center.
Better to walk forth in the murderous air
And wash my wound in the snows; that would be healing,
Because my heart would throb less painful there,
Being caked with cold, and past the smart of feeling.
Which would you choose, and for what boot in gold,
The absence, or the absence and the cold?","""I am a man of the world, but I am not of this world"" ""I am not a man, but of the earth, and I am of this earth"" ""My heart would throb less if I were to walk in the snow"" ""If I could choose between the cold and the absence, I would choose the cold"""
The Death of the Old Year,"Full knee-deep lies the winter snow,
And the winter winds are wearily sighing:
Toll ye the church bell sad and slow,
And tread softly and speak low,
For the old year lies a-dying.
       Old year you must not die;
       You came to us so readily,
       You lived with us so steadily,
       Old year, you shall not die.
He lieth still: he doth not move:
He will not see the dawn of day.
He hath no other life above.
He gave me a friend and a true truelove
And the New-year will take ’em away.
       Old year you must not go;
       So long you have been with us,
       Such joy as you have seen with us,
       Old year, you shall not go.
He froth’d his bumpers to the brim;
A jollier year we shall not see.
But tho’ his eyes are waxing dim,
And tho’ his foes speak ill of him,
He was a friend to me.
       Old year, you shall not die;
       We did so laugh and cry with you,
       I’ve half a mind to die with you,
       Old year, if you must die.
He was full of joke and jest,
But all his merry quips are o’er.
To see him die across the waste
His son and heir doth ride post-haste,
But he’ll be dead before.
       Every one for his own.
       The night is starry and cold, my friend,
       And the New-year blithe and bold, my friend,
       Comes up to take his own.
How hard he breathes! over the snow
I heard just now the crowing cock.
The shadows flicker to and fro:
The cricket chirps: the light burns low:
’Tis nearly twelve o’clock.
       Shake hands, before you die.
       Old year, we’ll dearly rue for you:
       What is it we can do for you?
       Speak out before you die.
His face is growing sharp and thin.
Alack! our friend is gone,
Close up his eyes: tie up his chin:
Step from the corpse, and let him in
That standeth there alone,
       And waiteth at the door.
       There’s a new foot on the floor, my friend,
       And a new face at the door, my friend,
       A new face at the door.","The poem was written in the early hours of the New Year's Eve. It was written by a friend of the writer's who died in a car crash in 2011. The writer's son and heir doth ride post-haste, but he’ll be dead before the New-year."
A Gull Goes Up,"Gulls when they fly move in a liquid arc,
Still head, and wings that bend above the breast, 
Covering its glitter with a cloak of dark,
Gulls fly. So as at last toward balm and rest, 
Remembering wings, the desperate leave their earth, 
Bear from their earth what there was ruinous-crossed,
Peace from distress, and love from nothing-worth, 
Fast at the heart, its jewels of dear cost.
Gulls go up hushed to that entrancing flight,
With never a feather of all the body stirred.
So in an air less rare than longing might 
The dream of flying lift a marble bird.
Desire it is that flies; then wings are freight 
That only bear the feathered heart no weight.","Gulls when they fly move in a liquid arc, still head, and wings that bend above the breast. Gulls go up hushed to that entrancing flight, with never a feather of all the body stirred."

No one looked after me or my brother back then, no CPS, 
no Social Workers, the SP’s couldn’t be trusted,
the off-base cops even worse.
When the P-EX mini-mart clerk told me
I wasn’t supposed to be there
and had to leave my Pork & Beans
and bread on the counter, you caught up to me in the parking lot,
my items in your tote bag.
I got caught stealing a sleeved stick of butter
the week prior, but today had returned
with the Susan B. Anthony dollar coin I found in the gutter.
All I had was that and my pocketknife for opening cans and gutting fish,

the reason my privileges were revoked.
I wish I had answered your questions—What’s going on?
Why can’t you shop here? Where are your parents?

dropping the piece of money at your feet.","The author was arrested for shoplifting at the Keesler AFB Post Exchange in 1987 (Biloxi, Mississippi) No one looked after him or his brother back then, no CPS, no Social Workers, the SP’s couldn’t be trusted, the off-base cops even worse."

breathing became obscene.

The Need Is So Great,"Sometimes I just sit like this at the window and watch

I’m thinking now of how far it always seems there is to go.
Maybe it is too easy that I speak so often
of late last light on a December day,
of that stubborn grass that somehow still remains green
behind the broken chain link fence on the corner.
But the need is so great for the way light looks
as it takes its leave of us. We say
what we can to each other of these things,
we who are such thieves, stealing first
one breath and then the next. Bach, keep going
just this slowly, show me the way to believe
that what matters in this world has already happened
and will go on happening forever.

of the stricken leaves of the copper beech
at the end of the block is something to behold.","The way light falls on the last leaves of the copper beech is something to behold. Sometimes I just sit like this at the window and watch the darkness come. If I'm smart, I’ll put on Bach."

New Year’s Chimes,"What is the song the stars sing?
    (And a million songs are as song of one.)
This is the song the stars sing:
    Sweeter song’s none.
One to set, and many to sing,
    (And a million songs are as song of one),
One to stand, and many to cling,
The many things, and the one Thing,
    The one that runs not, the many that run.
The ever new weaveth the ever old

Ever telling the never told;
The silver saith, and the said is gold,
    And done ever the never done.
The chase that’s chased is the Lord o’ the chase
(And a million songs are as song of one),
And the pursued cries on the race;
    And the hounds in leash are the hounds that run.
Hidden stars by the shown stars’ sheen;
    (And a million suns are but as one);
Colours unseen by the colours seen,
And sounds unheard heard sounds between,
    And a night is in the light of the sun.
An ambuscade of lights in night,
    (And a million secrets are but as one),
And a night is dark in the sun’s light,
    And a world in the world man looks upon.
Hidden stars by the shown stars’ wings,
    (And a million cycles are but as one),
And a world with unapparent strings
Knits the stimulant world of things;
    Behold, and vision thereof is none.
The world above in the world below,
    (And a million worlds are but as one),
And the One in all; as the sun’s strength so
Strives in all strength, glows in all glow
    Of the earth that wits not, and man thereon.
Braced in its own fourfold embrace
    (And a million strengths are as strength of one),
And round it all God’s arms of grace,
The world, so as the Vision says,
    Doth with great lightning-tramples run.
And thunder bruiteth into thunder,
    (And a million sounds are as sound of one),
From stellate peak to peak is tossed a voice of wonder,
And the height stoops down to the depths thereunder,
    And sun leans forth to his brother sun.
And the more ample years unfold
    (With a million songs as song of one),
A little new of the ever old,
A little told of the never told,
    Added act of the never done.
Loud the descant, and low the theme,
    (A million songs are as song of one)
And the dream of the world is dream in dream,
But the one Is is, or nought could seem;
    And the song runs round to the song begun.
This is the song the stars sing,

Chorus,"My grandfather went on his moped to the factory, two hours travel each way.
The rest of the days he fished in the woods.
The fishing rods and the nets he tied to the moped.
When I was old enough, he took me.
We rode with our legs out in the air on the bags.
We fished for eel.
Boiled water out of the creek for coffee, tea, and soup.
If we didn’t catch anything, we had nothing.
At night, when we lay to sleep, the world changed.
It talks to you.
You hear. You smell.
When the water goes down, the ground has a scent.
Small bodies walking through the open tent,
over the sleeping bag,
then, at a certain hour, it’s quiet.
In the morning, but some time before the sun, a bird would sing,
then another. They all move to the highest branch.
They make a chorus. Locating one another.
A leaf sways in the first light.
Many leaves, suspended, without contracting a single muscle.
They are like birds.
I was happy. I had survived. I was young.","My grandfather went on his moped to the factory, two hours travel each way. He fished for eel and boiled water out of the creek for coffee, tea and soup."

XIII. Return to Suzhou: Master of the Nets,"It was meant to conjure the life of a fisherman—
solitude simplicity and peace—
hence the name—Master of the Nets Garden.
Not the real life, of course, but what a nobleman
(who else would bankroll such quiet grace?)
imagines when he thinks life of a fisherman:  
the sea in miniature, harnessed, halcyon 
abundant fish (giant koi, not bass). 
It’s a stand-in wilderness, a Chinese garden—
each tree a forest, each rock a mountain—
for those obliged to keep close to the house.
There are even breaking waves: our would-be fisherman 
could watch, from covered walkways, a procession
of ripples launched across his fishpond’s surface
by pelting raindrops; his master gardener
dispensed perfection even in the rain. 
I visit in a downpour—paradise—
while, out on open sea, a master fisherman,
expanse itself his garden, plies his nets.","It was meant to conjure the life of a fisherman, a man of simplicity and peace. It's a stand-in wilderness, a Chinese garden, each tree a forest, each rock a mountain."

from “Phantasus”,"translated by Babette Deutsch and Avrahm Yarmolinsky
On a mountain of sugar-candy,
under a blossoming almond-tree,
twinkles my gingerbread house.
Its little windows are of gold-foil, out of its chimney steams wadding.
In the green heaven, above me, beams the Christmas tree.

In my round sea of tinfoil
are mirrored all her angels, all her lights!

The little children stand about
and stare at me.

I am the dwarf Turlitipu.

My fat belly is made of gumdragon,
my thin pin-legs are matches,
my clever little eyes
raisins!

  Auf einem Berg aus Zuckerkant,
unter einem blühenden Machandelbaum,
blinkt mein Pfefferkuchenhäuschen.
Seine Fensterchen sind aus Goldpapier,
aus seinem Schornstein raucht Watte.
Im grünen Himmel, über mir, rauscht die Weihnachtstanne.
In meinem See aus Staniol
spiegeln sich alle ihre Engel, alle ihre Lichter!

Snow in the Suburbs,"                    Every branch big with it,
                    Bent every twig with it;
            Every fork like a white web-foot;
            Every street and pavement mute:
Some flakes have lost their way, and grope back upward when
Meeting those meandering down they turn and descend again.
        The palings are glued together like a wall,
        And there is no waft of wind with the fleecy fall.
            A sparrow enters the tree,
            Whereon immediately
        A snow-lump thrice his own slight size
        Descends on him and showers his head and eye
                    And overturns him,
                    And near inurns him,
        And lights on a nether twig, when its brush
Starts off a volley of other lodging lumps with a rush.
            The steps are a blanched slope,
            Up which, with feeble hope,
        A black cat comes, wide-eyed and thin;
                    And we take him in.","Every branch big with it, every fork like a white web-foot. Every street and pavement mute: some flakes have lost their way, and grope back upward. The palings are glued together like a wall."
Abstract with Red Square,"after Etel Adnan

Owl,"In winter, we find her invisible
against the furrows
of cottonwood bark. Her swivel
and lean follow us until
we sit on the old polished log
we call creature. She blinks,
swells her feathers out, shakes and settles.
It’s a good day when I see an owl.
We watch until she drops—a fall
opening to swoop and glide. What is it
with lesbians and owls? Someone
asked. I’ll leave the question
there. There’s a world
the old trees make of water
and air. I like to feel the day
undress its cool oblivion, currents
moving the one mind of leaves,
shadows deeper with the breath
of owls. Just the chance she might
be there watching makes me
love—no—makes me loved.","In winter, we find her invisible against the furrows of cottonwood bark. Her swivel and lean follow us until we sit on the old polished log. Just the chance she might be there watching makes me love her."
Origin of Planets,"In this version, the valley
lime green after rain
rolls its tides before us.
A coyote bush shivers with seed.
We hold out our palms as if catching snow—
our villages of circular tracts
overcast with stars.
We have been moving together in sequence
for thousands of years, paralyzed
only by the question of time.
But now it is autumn under bishop pines—
the young blown down by wind feed
their lichens to the understory.
We follow the deer-path
past the ferns, to the flooded
upper reaches of the estuary.
The channel snakes through horsetails
and hemlock as the forest deepens, rises
behind us and the blue heron,
frozen in the shallows.
The shadow of her long neck ripples.
Somewhere in the rustling tulle reeds
spider is casting her threads to the light
and we spot a crimson-hooded fly agaric,
her toadstool’s gills white
as teeth as the sun
                bleeds into the Pacific.
We will walk the trail
until it turns to sand
and wait at the spit’s edge, listening
to the breakers, the seagulls
as they chatter their twilight preparations.
What we won’t understand
about the sound of the sea is no different
than the origin of planets
or the wind’s crystalline structures
irreversibly changing.
The albatross drags her parachute
over the earth’s gaping mouth.
We turn back only for the instant
the four dimensions fold
into a sandcastle—before its towers
are collapsed by waves.
The face that turns
toward the end of its world
dissolves into space—
despite us, the continuum
remains.","In this version, the valley islime green after rain and the searolls its tides before us. We will walk the trail until it turns to sand and wait at the spit’s edge, listening to the breakers."

Winter: A Dirge,"The wintry west extends his blast,
   And hail and rain does blaw;
Or, the stormy north sends driving forth
   The blinding sleet and snaw:
While, tumbling brown, the burn comes down,
   And roars frae bank to brae;
And bird and beast in covert rest,
   And pass the heartless day.
“The sweeping blast, the sky o’ercast,”
   The joyless winter-day
Let others fear, to me more dear
   Than all the pride of May:
The tempest’s howl, it soothes my soul,
   My griefs it seems to join;
The leafless trees my fancy please,
   Their fate resembles mine!
Thou Power Supreme whose mighty scheme
   These woes of mine fulfil,
Here, firm, I rest; they must be best,
   Because they are Thy will!
Then all I want—O do Thou grant
   This one request of mine.—
Since to enjoy Thou dost deny,
   Assist me to resign.","“The tempest’s howl, it soothes my soul,” the poet writes. “The leafless trees my fancy please,’ he adds, “Their fate resembles mine!” “Then all I want—O do Thou grant me this one request of mine.”"
Mazel Tov,"Circular breather, our dog can whine
without ceasing, his tail thumping the wall
beside the bed to call me up and out to the yard
instead. In moonlight, the hydrangeas’
white blossoms are a zodiac of branch-bound
constellations. Once, God called Abraham
out from his tent to the open field to count
the uncountable lights in the sky, promising
offspring bountiful as dust, numerous
as the stars. Like Abraham, I too left
my land, my birthplace, my father’s house.
But the closest I have to offspring
is lifting his leg at the azalea, nose busy
with the news the night air brings.
Mazel tov! we say at births and other
joyous occasions, the Jewish go-to
for Congratulations! Yet טוֹב tov means “good”
and מַזָּל mazel, “constellation” or “destiny,”
and sometimes, like Abraham, you must
leave the place that grew you to grow
toward better stars. In the house, my wife
is sleeping. Along the fence-top, a procession
of possums reminds that even in darkness
there are those who can see. Above,
trees, thick with summer, frame a porthole
of sky. Maybe, though, it’s not always the stars
that matter but the space between them,
the lines we draw to shape the absence,
the lives we forge around what goes missing.
From the deck, the cool breeze makes a festival
of the silver-lit leaves. Under my palm,
there’s the warmth of his fur, the rise
of his ribs. He doesn’t suspect his kidneys
are failing, that his muzzle is white
as the winter our vet has said he will
not live to see. Like all of us, he is
dying; like most of us, he doesn’t
know it. His chin on my leg, he trusts me
with the weight of his head. So, if I wish
you, mazel tov, know what I mean is,
May you find a reason to open
your door to the dark. I’ll mean,
May you live beneath good stars,
and take the time to notice.","Like Abraham, I too left my land, my birthplace, my father’s house. Sometimes, like Abraham, you must leave the place that grew you to grow toward better stars. I’ll mean, May you find a reason to open your door to the dark."
Midnight Mass for the Dying Year,"Yes, the Year is growing old,
  And his eye is pale and bleared!
Death, with frosty hand and cold,
  Plucks the old man by the beard,
       Sorely,—sorely! 

The leaves are falling, falling,
  Solemnly and slow;
Caw! caw! the rooks are calling,
  It is a sound of woe,
       A sound of woe! 

Through woods and mountain-passes
  The winds, like anthems, roll;
They are chanting solemn masses,
  Singing; Pray for this poor soul,
       Pray,—pray!

And the hooded clouds, like friars,
  Tell their beads in drops of rain,
And patter their doleful prayers;—
  But their prayers are all in vain,
       All in vain! 

There he stands in the foul weather,
  The foolish, fond Old Year,
Crowned with wild flowers and with heather,
    Like weak, despised Lear,
       A king,—a king! 

Then comes the summer-like day,
  Bids the old man rejoice!
His joy! his last! O, the old man gray
  Loveth that ever-soft voice,
       Gentle and low. 

To the crimson woods he saith,
  And the voice gentle and low
Of the soft air, like a daughter's breath,
  Pray do not mock me so!
       Do not laugh at me!

And now the sweet day is dead;
  Cold in his arms it lies;
No stain from its breath is spread
  Over the glassy skies,
       No mist or stain! 

Then, too, the Old Year dieth,
  And the forests utter a moan,
Like the voice of one who crieth
  In the wilderness alone,
       Vex not his ghost!

Then comes, with an awful roar,
  Gathering and sounding on,
The storm-wind from Labrador,
  The wind Euroclydon,
        The storm-wind! 

Howl! howl! and from the forest
  Sweep the red leaves away!
Would, the sins that thou abhorrest,
  O Soul! could thus decay,
       And be swept away!

For there shall come a mightier blast,
  There shall be a darker day; 
And the stars, from heaven down-cast
  Like red leaves be swept away!
       Kyrie, Eleyson!
       Christe, Eleyson! ","The Old Year is growing old, and his eye is pale and bleared! The winds, like anthems, roll; they are chanting solemn masses. And the hooded clouds, like friars, tell their beads in drops of rain. But their prayers are all in vain."

sound and fury,"The gloom is
the off-white of white. Because white can’t know
what white knows. Where’s the life in that?
Where’s the right in that? Where’s the white in that?
At the bone of bone white breathes the fear of being,
the frustration of seeming unequal to white.
White portraits on white walls signal ownership of all,
even as white walls white in.
And this is understandable, yes,
understandable because the culture claims white
is owed everything—a wealth of inheritance
a system insures. In each generation
the equation holds—and better than
before and indifferent to now and enough
and always and inevitably white.
This is what it means to wear a color and believe
its touch an embrace. Even without luck
or chance of birth the scaffolding has rungs
and legacy and the myth of meritocracy fixed in white.
That’s how white holds itself together
as the days hold so many white would not—
White is living within brick-and-mortar, walling off
all others’ loss, exhaustion, aggrieved
exposure, dispossessed despair—
in daylight white hardens its features.
Eyes, which hold all light, harden.
Jaws, closing down on justice,
harden into a fury that will not call
white to account even as for some
its pledge is cut out from under.
If people could just come clean about their lives,
even as poverty exists inside white walls,
and just being white is what’s working.
Who implies white could disown its own
even as white won’t strike its own structure.
Even as white won’t oust its own system.
All redress fuels nothing the second another
can be thrown out.
In daylight white’s right to righteous rage
doubles down on the supremacy
of white in our way.","At the bone of bone white breathes the fear of being, the frustration of seeming unequal to white. White portraits on white walls signal ownership of all. Even without luck or chance of birth the scaffolding has rungs."
The Mansion,"It all changed
when the daughters of  men
began giving birth to us.
We had no hair.
Our mothers held us
against their thick hair.
It tickled our throats
as we suckled.
There were more and more and more
of us.
The hairy said,
“We want your smooth.”
We said,
“We want your hairy.”
We all wept
because no one
had what they wanted.
We escaped more and more
to the beach.
The hairy hated water
but it was different for us.
Our hips swiveled
as we climbed
deeper and deeper.
We held our breath.
We told our hairy families
that we belonged in the water.
They clutched at us.
One day
one of us
found it.
Our first pearl.
So smooth.
So strong.
So perfect.
We raked our fingers
through the sea bottom.
We stuffed coral with pearls
and molded it.
Among the seaweed and shells
our mansion rose.
One day
one of us
went back to the shore.
She showed
a pearl to them.
They said,
“We will give you
five bags of hair.”
Some of  us became traders
while the rest built.
The more magnificent our mansion became
the more pearls they wanted.
They said to our traders,
“We will give you
ten bags of hair for each pearl.”
Our traders brought back
bags and bags of hair.
We raced
through our winding passageways
to deposit the bags.
We loved rubbing along
our smooth bumpy walls.
Food grew on our walls
and we suckled the pearls.
We kissed.
Some of our bellies grew
into enormous pearls.
Some of  our babies
were hairy yet so slick!
Then we found
fewer and fewer pearls.
We raked the sea bottom
farther and farther away.
The traders pressed for more.
They pressed and pressed and pressed.
We convened
and said no.
Some of our traders said,
“But we have to have hair!”
We laughed and said,
“For what?”
Then we found
a hollowed-out wall.
Another wall swayed loose.
And in our storage cavern
hair began seeping
out of the bags.
Hair crawled
all over our walls.
Suckling the pearls,
hair got into our mouths.
Kissing,
hair got in between our lips.
We awoke
with strands around our necks.
We tore them off.
We gathered hair off
our precious walls.
We told the thieves,
“Stop bringing back hair!”
But they could not help it.
They stole more pearls
and returned with more bags.
They said,
“We must do it.”
They said,
“The world demands it.”
They said,
“Hair is the only way.”
We convened
and decided.
Thirty-two thousand years later
bubbles of our laughter
still rise.
A few
still sell pearls
and wonder where we are.
 ","When we were born, we had no hair. Our mothers held us against their thick hair, tickling our throats as we suckled. The hairy hated water, but it was different for us. We loved rubbing alongour smooth bumpy walls and sucking pearls."
Theft,"The moon
Was an old, old woman, tonight,
Hurrying home;
Calling pitifully to her children,
The stars,
Begging them to go home with her
For she was afraid,
But they would not.
They only laughed
While she crept along
Huddling against the dark blue wall of the Night
Stooping low,
Her old black hood wrapped close about her ears,
And only the pale curve of her yellow cheek
With a tear in the hollow of it
Showing through.
And the wind laughed too,
For he was teasing the old woman,
Pelting her with snowballs,
Filling her old eyes with the flakes of them,
Making her cold.
She stumbled along, shivering,
And once she fell,
And the snow buried her;
And all her jewels
Slid from the old bag
Under her arm
And fell to earth,
And the tall trees seized them,
And hung them about their necks,
And filled their bony arms with them.
All their nakedness was covered by her jewels,
And they would not give them back to her.
The old moon-woman moaned piteously,
Hurrying home;
And the wild wind laughed at her
And her children laughed too,
And the tall trees taunted her
With their glittering plunder.","An old moon-woman moaned piteously,Hurrying home;. And the wild wind laughed at her. And her children laughed too, and the tall trees taunted her."

the one in the far corner of my grandmother’s yard,
whose bark was a tapestry of rough diamonds.
Your first branch was low enough to leap to,
textured enough to hold me. And each branch after
placed as though to keep me climbing.
I paused only to press my ear to your trunk
and hear it: the heartbeat of water
moving toward the leaves, the conversation
between roots and sky. Climbing until my hair
twined your needles’ spines; until, anointed
by your green, you took root within me; so I speak
from the part of me who grows you, grows
with you, who will always live in your branches.
And in the boughs, so many there with me.

on our own, a vision otherwise beyond us.
All of us, in that overstory, unalone.","“Blessed are you, God our God, Sovereign of the World, who has given us the Torah of truth, planting within us life everlasting” —the prayer recited after an aliyah."

not so much against a child as for other things—our art, each other: a life barren
only of all we’ll never know. God said, “I’ll call you
by a different name and your destiny shall change.” Sarai, barren,
had no children but Sarah did. Mom is a name I’ve cried times beyond counting,
yet is a name I’ll never be called—less a name than a state of being; once borne,
innate as DNA. “Wife” or “writer,” though, are titles non-familial,
vocational, requiring daily upkeep, a renewal of Yes, I will still bear
this—and be stronger for it? Who can say. Perhaps we’ll end up
most defined by what we are not. Yet bared
by the roof of our ruined structure, we count the countless stars, grow
our shared life in place of bearing
a new one. Because before Sarah and even before Sarai
was the first of the three names she’d eventually bear:
Iscah, whose root might be סָּכְתָה sakhta (saw) which would make her sight a prophet’s,
divinely inspired, or סוֹכִין sokhin, a duller lot, meaning all “gazed upon” her beauty: barren
Iscah—precursor to the name Jessica—like all women, torn between being a seer
and being the one seen. So, prophet, tell me: Is the only happy ending really a baby?","Sarai, barren, had no children but Sarah did. She pimped her handmaid to her husband, saying, “As I am barren, please ‘consort’” with her."
A Question to Ask Once the Honeymoon is Over,"Big around as my bike helmet and high as my ankle, the box turtle
was halfway from my side of the road
to the other. The warm sun felt delicious;
my legs, strong, and it was almost
to the center line. I hadn’t been passed by a car
for miles. Figuring if it was still there, I’d pick it up
on the way back, I cycled past.
                                                                Years before,
the woman across the street was shaped like that turtle,
or more like a toadstool, really, squat bell
of a body atop the thin stalks of her legs, milky and bare
beneath her frayed black housedress. It hurt her to move—clear
even from my second-story window—so she brought
her trash out in increments, in small, bursting
grocery bags. She tossed each out the door onto the porch, then
nudged them, one step to the next, before easing—carefully,
painfully—herself down, a step at a time. Then she toed them,
finally, slowly, slowly into a crumpled heap at the curb. I left
my window to help; then took her trash out every week after.
                                                                That story—
                                                       I hadn’t yet
                                                                told it to my wife, had I?
                        But there was the turnaround
quicker than expected and I spun
to find a beat-down bus trailed by all the fuming cars
that hadn’t passed me.
                               Steadying my handlebars against the wind,
I rode back hard, dodging around crushed
squirrels and tire-splayed birds.
                                                 The turtle
was just where I’d left it, but with the top of its shell
torn away. The dead turtle,
a raw red bowl, its blood slashing the twinned yellow lines
into an unequal sign,
                    as in a ≠ b, as in thinking about doing the right thing
is not the same as doing it. As in, how many times
did I watch that old woman shuffle bags down the stairs
(really, how many?) before I went from watching
to helping? As in, with my wife beside me
I am the woman who does not hesitate
to lay down her bike and give a small life
safe passage. As in, I biked slowly
home, told no one. As in:
                 Will she love me
                      less when she learns
                I am not equal

Self-Portrait as Land Snail,"Don’t get me wrong.
I’m a modest girl, couldn’t even strip off
at one of those nudie hot springs out west,
the whole place a flotsam
of much-nursed areolas and buoyant
scrotums while I sat prim
as Gidget, legs crossed and awkwardly
smiling on the shore. It’s just that the snail
is on to something—neither boy nor girl
but both, the critter is nearly mythic—a true
hermaphrodite that all alone
will go to its own kind of cyrobank and baste
itself, make a new batch of not-so-bouncies
in thin, flea-sized shells. But no, that’s not
me. That seems lonely. Better, with another
intersex other it will take
aim, flex back its bow, shoot a dart,
then wait to be impaled
in return. I couldn’t make this shit up
if I tried—this is no metaphor
but scientific fact—a telum amoris—literally,
a weapon of love—a James-Bond-worthy arrow
equipped with four blades spiked
with all the dirty talk a snail could want.
Cupid’s got nothing on this
mollusk congress, and because you know
how snails go, the foreplay is slow—
slow, slow, slow—my kind of sex—
going on and on until the hussy
who first received that dart has enough
then rises to fire back. Now, knowing this,
I can say I didn’t come out
all those years ago, whatever that means. No,
when I finally made a home
for my body in the bed of another
woman, I simply became
a land snail. Tired of being
a leaking receptacle for a man’s desire,
I needed to feel
an equal’s push against my own,
a willingness to be wounded and to
wound, receiving and giving at the same
time. Plainly said, I needed the kind of love
that finally let me take
my time; I needed to fire
an arrow of my damn own.",The author is a land snail. She fell in love with the critter after having sex with another woman. The snail is a mythic creature that all alone will go to its own kind of cyrobank.
Wild Thing,"What I knew then was plastic packages
of ramen—instant, four for a dollar,
because with four eggs to match, I’d have myself
four dinners, provided I could keep the gas on
for the month and get that old stove lit.
with a match. I also knew what went
at the store for a buck: pinto beans and sliced white,
popcorn, carrots, peas . . . even juice, long as it was
orange, concentrated and frozen in a can.
But what I didn’t yet know was how
that word—buck—got started, back with
my daddy’s daddy’s daddy and on back
down the line, back when for their rheumy knees
men used panther oil brought all the way
up from Florida when panthers still lived
down there, back when men without a dime
to their name could pay land taxes in
skins and piled as many kills they could
on a wagon headed downtown
to sell deer for just that—for one dollar, one
buck, a pop. No, what I knew then were bucks
in my tip jar, how never to start the night empty
but to always put in a few of my own, otherwise
not a soul would think me worth a dollar
and would trash the whole shift
with the rattle of pocket change.
And though I couldn’t have said when deer season
hit, no one had to tell me
about the weather it brought, how cardboard
crammed between wind-rattled panes helped
but barely enough, how under every cover I owned
I’d sleep until the floor stung my feet
awake with cold. Once I got up and turned over
my car, I just might make it to work
on time, but not until I got stuck at a red light
with a man who split his two fingers apart
to make a V for the snake-flick of his fat
tongue, which meant something
about “a good time” before he gunned
his truck and gave me the full view
of what his flatbed towed—a whitetail
doe, one eye open but somehow more
milk or smoke or dirty dishwater than
eye, her tongue off its hinge, flopping
obscene with every bump down
that road. On my popping speakers, a new
version of that same old song—now you don’t need that
money when you look like that, do ya honey—
and it was then I knew the bullshit
made up for the endless litany to hit
these woods—all those floods that scrubbed
the babes from their burrows, lifting
their pink writing to a flotsam of rot, or else
a rage of flames to crowd those same holes
with natural-born enemies, snakes
huddled alongside a scorched blister
of mice and turtles nearly cooked
in their own shells—and everybody saying
wild things could care for themselves and always knew
what to do: how to seek higher
ground and survive. But really, believing that made me
just another fool in this world mistaking
the happiness of looking at a pretty, wild thing
with the happiness that thing feels.
Put another way, I was once young and terribly
pretty and gripped the wheel white, felt the rip
in the vinyl seat rub the part of my leg
raw where my skirt didn’t
cover. I shut off
my radio. In the silence was the talk of men I’d heard
all my life—the bumper stickers that read
show me your rack or chasing white
tail—all the old jokes—that buck not dead
but put down for his dirt nap and itching for a mount,
that doe not female but a slickhead, hot and ready
for the rut, all those not shot but taken in peak season,
in sweet, sweet November. Put another way, I was almost
on empty, and though no one
believed it or cared to see, I was just another
animal, and like all animals
desired, we would suffer.","The author grew up in a small town in rural New Hampshire. He says he learned the word ""buck"" from his father, who sold deer for a buck a pop. He was once young and terribly pretty and gripped the wheel white on his way to work."

A Grey Day,"Grey drizzling mists the moorlands drape,
Rain whitens the dead sea,
From headland dim to sullen cape
Gray sails creep wearily.
I know not how that merchantman
Has found the heart ; but ’t is her plan
Seaward her endless course to shape.
Unreal as insects that appall
A drunkard’s peevish brain,
O’er the gray deep the dories crawl,
Four-legged, with rowers twain :
Midgets and minims of the earth,
Across old ocean’s vasty girth
Toiling — heroic, comical !
I wonder how that merchant’s crew
Have ever found the will !
I wonder what the fishes do
To keep them toiling still !
I wonder how the heart of man
Has patience to live out its span,
Or wait until its dreams come true. ",The poem was written in the early 20th century. It is about a merchantman and his crew on a voyage around the world. The story is about the crew's struggle to make their dreams come true.
Idyllic,"To lie beneath a cloudless sky

Where smells of wild-flowers in the dells

To dream of shepherd with his crook,
     Of sheep on grassy slopes asleep,—
To catch a visionary look
     Of shepherdess, and hear her step
Fall like a whisper on the ground,—
     To watch her sunny smiles, and see

Pebbles,"Out of a pellucid brook
Pebbles round and smooth I took :
Like a jewel, every one
Caught a color from the sun, —
Ruby red and sapphire blue,
Emerald and onyx too,
Diamond and amethyst, —
Not a precious stone I missed :
Gems I held from every land
In the hollow of my hand.
Workman Water these had made ;
Patiently through sun and shade,
With the ripples of the rill
He had polished them until,
Smooth, symmetrical and bright,
Each one sparkling in the light
Showed within its burning heart

And the brook seemed thus to sing :
Patience conquers everything !

Song at Daybreak,"Unto the portal of the Day there came
A shining presence fashioned out of flame,
And from that purple threshold of the world
Arrows of fire across the shadows hurled.
Into the forest, over plain and sea
The darts in silence sped unerringly,—
Lances of sunlight from the Morning’s bow,—
Until the firmament was all aglow.
Then from the zenith suddenly I heard
The dew-fresh notes of some enraptured bird,
Lost in the golden labyrinth of light,
Singing the dreams of a departed Night.","A shining presence fashioned out of flame came into the world. From the zenith suddenly I heard the dew-fresh notes of some enraptured bird,                Lost in the golden labyrinth of light."
A Tale,"This youth too long has heard the break
Of waters in a land of change.
He goes to see what suns can make
From soil more indurate and strange.
He cuts what holds his days together
And shuts him in, as lock on lock:
The arrowed vane announcing weather,
The tripping racket of a clock;
Seeking, I think, a light that waits
Still as a lamp upon a shelf,—
A land with hills like rocky gates
Where no sea leaps upon itself.
But he will find that nothing dares
To be enduring, save where, south
Of hidden deserts, torn fire glares
On beauty with a rusted mouth,—
Where something dreadful and another
Look quietly upon each other.","This youth too long has heard the breakings of waters in a land of change. He goes to see what suns can make from soil more indurate and strange. But he will find that nothing dares to be enduring, save where, south, torn fire glares."

Rice, grandfather of Jim Crow, popularizes the phrase with a song of same name, dancing and singing in blackface, to play a trickster figure, without the wisdom of Anansi, but “nah, uh-uh, nah nah nah nah nah nah nah nah nah,” was all black people heard when he sang his song.

Triptych,"His wind-swirled fingertips
untangle the roots of salt water,
thorned with wrens
pecking at roans
whipping their manes
toward some new sunlight,
some new charred horse bit’s history.
Cornered into being a son
he should have never
left a snow-tipped leaf’s edge
in the hillside
where a barren cloud’s porous skull
keeps a winter house.
—
Coyote, open-jawed,
limp shoulder against his ear,
its silhouette: midnight blue—
            a satchel of stars
                        where its tail snaps     awake.
—
A knot of lung steam
behind his ribs;
a meteor charring white
over yellowing aspen;
he reaches down,
loosens shoelaces—
wind-dried roots unfurl,
his new name: seven times his height.
His knees press light to dark,
creasing them over and over
until his face smears and        fades.","Coyote, open-jawed, with alimp shoulder against his ear, has a silhouette: midnight blue. He reaches down,loosens shoelaces,wind-dried roots unfurl, his new name: seven times his height."
At Sixty-Five,"It was all so different than he expected.
For years he’d been agnostic; now he meditated.
For years he’d dreamed of being an artist living abroad;
now he reread Baudelaire, Emerson, Bishop.
He’d never considered marriage . . .
Still, a force through green did fuse.
Yes, he wore his pants looser.
No, he didn’t do crosswords in bed.
No, he didn’t file for Social Security.
Yes, he danced alone in the bathroom mirror,
since younger men expected generosity.
Long ago, his thesis had been described as promising,
“with psychological heat and the consuming
will of nature.” Now he thought, “This then is all.”
On the rooftop, in pale flickering moonlight,
he pondered the annihilated earth.
At the pond, half-a-mile across was not
too far to swim because he seemed to be
going toward something. Yes, the love impulse
had frequently revealed itself in terms of conflict;
but this was an old sound, an austere element.
Yes, he’d been no angel and so what . . .
Yes, tiny moths emerged from the hall closet.
Yes, the odor of kombucha made him sick.
Yes, he lay for hours pondering the treetops,
the matriarchal clouds, the moon.
Though his spleen collected melancholy trophies,
his imagination was not impeded.","It was all so different than he expected. For years he’d been agnostic; now he meditated. At the pond, half-a-mile across, he seemed to be going toward something."
The Aim Was Song,"Before man came to blow it right
    The wind once blew itself untaught,
And did its loudest day and night
    In any rough place where it caught.
Man came to tell it what was wrong:
    It hadn’t found the place to blow;
It blew too hard—the aim was song.
    And listen—how it ought to go!
He took a little in his mouth,
    And held it long enough for north
To be converted into south,
    And then by measure blew it forth.
By measure. It was word and note,
    The wind the wind had meant to be—
A little through the lips and throat.
    The aim was song—the wind could see.","The wind once blew itself untaught, and did its loudest day and night. Man came to tell it what was wrong: It hadn't found the place to blow."
Country of Water,"I know who I am because I believe it
The breath in my chest
Insistent in its choice
The skin that I’m in
The bones and blood and veins
It carries like a promise
          Have you witnessed the ocean
Moving with so much gust and life
Have you witnessed the river
Still waters bubbling the rebirth of school
           Have you witnessed your body
Its own country of water
Moving against the tide of a world
So heartbreaking      it’s forgotten its own voice
Be still friend
Be still
Be kind to yourself in the gift of stillness
I know who I am because I believe it
I know
I know
Who I
Who I
Believe
Believe
Believe
In three’s we will come
A drip of water moving against a boulder
Water slow and steady can turn rock
Into a pebble
Like anxiety
Like self-doubt
Smaller
Smaller
Until gone
Let your love for yourself be the water
Be the rise
Be the mist
Let you be
I know who I am because I believe it
I believe I am my mother’s daughter
I believe I am my grandmother’s prayers
I believe I am my great-grandmother’s backbone revealed
I am I am because I believe so
I am because a woman believed in me
What a continent I became
What a country of water I be
I flow and fluid and rise and ebb and I believe in me
           I am not wrong
I am wronged
In this skin I’ve reclaimed
From this trap of this country’s tourniquet
Only to find the sweet solace is a river bed
Its mud beckons me closer to its silt
Small fish and forgotten glass unearth themselves
Like baby teeth
Only one can cut into flesh purposely
Only one does not know what it is capable of
I believe in the air as much as I believe in the fire
I believe in the fire as much as the water consumes
I believe in a higher source
Energetic and wise
I believe in my ability to thrive
This body
        This body is a good thing
Turning two miles walked over a bridge into a family’s meal
Creating poems that become cashier’s checks
Dentist bills and rent
I’ve three holes in my teeth
And a nation that pretends I didn’t almost die for it to survive
I am I am still here still here
I am still here and like the ocean, full of salt and shells
Full of ship remnants and noble ones
I bleed and the sand grieves
I be because someone survived for me to be here
Today
Breathing this almost air
Marching for cleaner belongings
My front seat beneath the deadening stars
Is still a seat
Is still a ground
Is still a home that I can pronounce my given name
To write amongst the forgotten names
The taken and the ignored
But today
            There are no tombstones
Today
There is no true death
Only life
Only life
Only a song of the living
Maybe even a belief system
With water as its minister
            I am water
I dive into my own currents
I dress my dreams in the satin breath
Of my ancestors
I know
I know
I know who I am
I know who I am because I believe it",I know who I am because I believe it. I believe in the fire as much as the water consumes. There is no true death. I am I am still here still here.

What if you found your shoe

What if the clock said 6:92

My tongue is the car wash

Can noodles swim?
My toes are dictionaries.
Do you need any words?
From now on I’ll only drink white milk on January 26.
What does minus mean?
I never want to minus you.
Just think––no one has ever seen

It is hard being a person.
I do and don’t love you––
isn’t that happiness?","I’ll invite a bee to live in your shoe. Music lives inside my legs. Don’t ever say “purpose” again, let’s throw the word out."

American Household,"Here I’m untethered, or else this American household is.
A shame for guest and resident alike, torn asunder,
Immovable, unmoving, horizon line before it closes
On the embankment, which is too a slowing thunder.

Is a frenzy of thought, an amusement from the spoils
Of corporation able to outweigh the will unnerving
All restraint from the madness or immodesty that coils

Inupiaq Women,"She paddles and streams

she passes the salt flats into  
the glass water; she skims 
for cod and chum,          hand over oar,

ripples tightening the drawstring
on her parka. A taffeta of cold air
hits her cheeks; they are sun-
wind chapped, a sign of Inupiaq women
subsisting for their young families.
In body, in Inuit, she thrives on the bleakest
ecstatic love. Here on her knees,
in her seal skin buoyant boat,
her duties of her village complete,
she knows her place among the caribou 
women. She knows her children 
with their earphones on, 
while playing video games, 
will not follow her in the knowledge of ice, 
dressing a caribou, preparing dry-fish, 
jarring jellies, dip netting hooligans, 
purse netting whitefish, tracking 
and setting traps for marmot, squirrels,
arctic fox and wolverines. She thinks 
of the children, hand over oar; 
they will stay at the village, carve 
for cleaving water with Inupiat hands.","Inupiaq women are the backbone of the Inuit community in northern Canada. They work hard to provide for their young families. The women of Kobuck River, Inuit village in northern Alaska, work hard on the land and in the sea."
To a Wreath of Snow,"O transient voyager of heaven!
   O silent sign of winter skies!
What adverse wind thy sail has driven
   To dungeons where a prisoner lies?
Methinks the hands that shut the sun
   So sternly from this morning’s brow
Might still their rebel task have done
   And checked a thing so frail as thou.
They would have done it had they known
   The talisman that dwelt in thee,
For all the suns that ever shone
   Have never been so kind to me!
For many a week, and many a day
   My heart was weighed with sinking gloom
When morning rose in mourning grey
   And faintly lit my prison room
But angel like, when I awoke,
   Thy silvery form so soft and fair
Shining through darkness, sweetly spoke
   Of cloudy skies and mountains bare;
The dearest to a mountaineer
   Who, all life long has loved the snow
That crowned her native summits drear,
   Better, than greenest plains below.
And voiceless, soulless, messenger
   Thy presence waked a thrilling tone
That comforts me while thou art here
   And will sustain when thou art gone","O transient voyager of heaven! O silent sign of winter skies! The talisman that dwelt in thee, the suns that ever shone have never been so kind to me!"
Sunflowers,"I’m in the world but I still want the world.

The Harp of Broken Strings,"A stranger in a stranger land,
    Too calm to weep, too sad to smile,
I take my harp of broken strings,
    A weary moment to beguile;
And tho no hope its promise brings,
    And present joy is not for me,
Still o’er that harp I love to bend,
    And feel its broken melody
With all my shattered feelings blend.
I love to hear its funeral voice
    Proclaim how sad my lot, how lone;
And when, my spirit wilder grows,
    To list its deeper, darker tone.
And when my soul more madly glows
    Above the wrecks that round it lie,
It fills me with a strange delight,
    Past mortal bearing, proud and high,
To feel its music swell to might.
When beats my heart in doubt and awe,
    And Reason pales upon her throne,
Ah, then, when no kind voice can cheer
    The lot too desolate, too lone,
Its tones come sweet upon my ear,
    As twilight o’er some landscape fair:
As light upon the wings of night
    (The meteor flashes in the air,
The rising stars) its tones are bright.
And now by Sacramento’s stream,
    What mem’ries sweet its music brings—
The vows of love, its smiles and tears,
    Hang o’er this harp of broken strings.
It speaks, and midst her blushing fears
    The beauteous one before me stands!
Pure spirit in her downcast eyes,
    And like twin doves her folded hands!
It breathes again—and at my side
    She kneels, with grace divinely rare—
Then showering kisses on my lips,
    She hides our busses with her hair;
Then trembling with delight, she flings
    Her beauteous self into my arms,
As if o’erpowered, she sought for wings
    To hide her from her conscious charms!
It breathes once more, and bowed in grief,
    The bloom has left her cheek forever,
While, like my broken harp-strings now,
    Behold her form with feeling quiver!
She turns her face o’errun with tears,
    To him that silent bends above her,
And, by the sweets of other years,
    Entreats him still, oh, still to love her!
He loves her still—but darkness falls
    Upon his ruined fortunes now,
And ’t is his exile doom to flee.
    The dews, like death, are on his brow,
And cold the pang about his heart
    Oh, cease—to die is agony:
’T is more than death when loved ones part!
Well may this harp of broken strings
    Seem sweet to me by this lonely shore.
When like a spirit it breaks forth,
    And speaks of beauty evermore!
When like a spirit it evokes

I Have Stood Up for You,"Being of your blood,
Through thick and thin,
      I have stood up for you.
When the world’s most devilish
Intrigue of humanity was set
And was coiling around you tighter and tighter—
      I have stood up for you.
When public sentiment was against you
And sent you to oblivion,
      I have stood up for you.
When the country was hysterically enraged
For defending your loved ones
And your birthright of priority—
      I have stood up for you.
When you were tagged as “Indians”
And outlawed creatures—
      I have stood up for you.
Haunted and hunted on thy domain,
With no chance of redress
But doomed, as though thy fate—
      I have stood up for you.
When you were described and pictured
And cartooned as cruel and savage—
      I have stood up for you.
When prejudice, hate and scorn
Sounded the keynote against you—
      I have stood up for you.
When starving and naked,
At the verge of your annihilation
By swords in the hands of criminals—
      I have stood up for you.
When the palefaces said
There was no hope for you—
      I have stood up for you.
When you were condemned and relegated
To the reservation system of hell—
      I have stood up for you.
When in prison and in bondage,
When you could neither speak nor see—
      I have stood up for you.
When decreed by the people across the sea
That you could neither learn nor be taught,
      I have stood up for you.
When it was put down black and white
That you could neither work nor support yourselves,
And that you were lazy and worthless—
      I have stood up for you.
When politics and greed were working you
For all that you were worth—
      I have stood up for you.
When everything you possessed was disappearing,
And your personal rights ignored—
      I have stood up for you.
As the Indian Bureau, like an octopus,
Sucked your very life blood,
      I have stood up for you.
For your freedom and citizenship,
By the abolishment of the Indian Bureau,
      I have stood up for you.
When the Indian Bureau says, “Were you freed
You would starve and be cheated”—
Only to feed its 7000 employees—
      I have stood up for you.
When you were judged “incompetent”
For freedom and citizenship by the Indian Bureau—
      I have stood up for you.
God knows that I am with thee day and night;
That is why I have stood up for you.
It might have been self-sacrifice.
It might have been the hand of God leading me.
Whatever it was, you have proven yourselves to be
What I have stood up for you to be.","When the world’s most devilish                Intrigue of humanity was coiling around you tighter and tighter, I have stood up for you.

In the Of
  Where is the third beloved head
(It is where all of our heads go)
While they stand consequential as passports
(I have hurt myself within the borders of the page)
(I have done this so they may see me)
  Where are their legs their feet
(Where the soil ends and the dream begins)
I have painted myself green and mottled
I have asked my body to crumple and rupture
In the desire pulling my eyes to the paint they remain
Unreachable unreached and unreaching they remain
Where do they belong?
(Never in the marketplace of nations)
(Never in the deleterious exchange of hands)
(Never in my pitiful abject sight)
(Never in my soft abject palms)
The torsos joined into a picket line
Fused like butter in the crumpled building’s dead refrigerator
  Where am I to look at them this way
As though lying down for them
(Prostrate in the tall grass waiting to be discovered)
And my hands so pitiful and empty
The language of survival cold within my teeth
Whatever I am seeking it is nowhere
And whoever I wish to be is dead
(I should kiss each of their cheeks)
(I should kiss them)
(I should have kissed them)
I should not have been born
  And where do they belong?
In the gentle abjection of the cactus spine a bird impaled upon it
In the blood leaking from the general’s eyes as he gurgles
In the survival language cracking my teeth to flee my mouth
In the folding and crumpling of my fingers as they break
(Are broken)",I have asked my body to crumple and rupture. I have hurt myself within the borders of the page. The torsos joined into a picket line.
The Tejano Considers Seeds,"To flower from seeds,
to make roots from water
means there’s a tending

Delicate young germination

A piece of ground from the Old French for sol.
A native lightness. The sol rises in Texas too.

Rising like a verb, there’s no stillness
to the threshold—another word for the bottom of a door,
meaning there’s a sill soiled. A sill or cut timber. Laid
& crossed over. To soil a verb meaning
there is original sin, meaning before dirt
there was cleanliness. No entry, no violation
of God. A mess of seeds that needs
water. Give us a mess of thick mud. 
            Que chiquero.             Standing still like a cleansing
after a gentle roll-around. Wallowing in a field

The Wall,"for J.B. 
The wall surrounding them they never saw;
The angels, often. Angels were as common
As birds or butterflies, but looked more human.
As long as the wings were furled, they felt no awe.
Beasts, too, were friendly. They could find no flaw
In all of Eden: this was the first omen.
The second was the dream which woke the woman.
She dreamed she saw the lion sharpen his claw.
As for the fruit, it had no taste at all.
They had been warned of what was bound to happen.
They had been told of something called the world.
They had been told and told about the wall.
They saw it now; the gate was standing open.
As they advanced, the giant wings unfurled.","They had been warned of what was bound to happen. They had been told of something called the world. They saw it now; the gate was standing open. As they advanced, the giant wings unfurled."
Sestina on Six Words by Weldon Kees,"I often wonder about the others,
Where they are bound for on the voyage,
What is the reason for their silence,
Was there some reason to go away?
It may be they carry a dark burden,
Expect some harm, or have done harm.
How can we show them we mean no harm?
Approach them? But they shy from others.
Offer, perhaps, to share the burden?
They change the subject to the voyage,
Or turn abruptly, walk away,
To brood against the rail in silence.
What is defeated by their silence
More than love, less than harm?
Many already are looking their way,
Pretending not to. Eyes of others
Will follow them now the whole voyage
And add a little to the burden.
Others touch hands to ease the burden,
Or stroll, companionable in silence,
Counting the stars which bless the voyage,
But let the foghorn speak of harm,
Their hearts will stammer like the others’,
Their hands seem in each other’s way.
It is so obvious, in a way.
Each is alone, each with his burden.
To others they are always others,
And they can never break the silence,
Say, lightly, thou, but to their harm
Although they make many a voyage.
What do they wish for from the voyage
But to awaken far away
By miracle free from every harm,
Hearing at dawn that sweet burden
The birds cry after a long silence?
Where is that country not like others?
There is no way to ease the burden.
The voyage leads on from harm to harm,
A land of others and of silence.","I often wonder about the others, where they are bound for on the voyage. They carry a dark burden, or have done harm. How can we show them we mean no harm? They shy from others."

Gahé Dzíł / Mountain Spirits,"always for my family
Circling around flames and dancing with the blazes
Encumbering sparks take flight into the night sky,
A swirling twinkle resembling a star crown
Moving into empty canopies resembling ghosts
A threshold colossal structure with rusty bells shakes
the sound of fire sings lingering beyond the flames
sent across the mountain and valleys
These spirits come from the mountains and move towards
the south, between the sacred narrow canyons,
The Sierra Madre Canyon walls sing in their echoes
A medicine reveals a stick and brings the wall down
For the Ndé—the people who wandered into night
Ascending towards the ending sky and onto the lost land
Losing their tongues and eyes they consume the mountain
Air and waters trying to heal all their lungs that bellowed
Outward against the slow breezes and heavy breaths
A hundred years the spirits protected them from
the sixteenth calvary who then believed, in all their hearts,
a good Injun was a dead Injun. Even then the spirits protected
the people for another twenty-seven years until they reached
                                    —their forced destination
A place where cutting their hair died as the spirits watched
The people searched the underground catacombs of St. Augustine
While hearing the waves crash against the stone walls
Outside the thick walls, the people were exposed
To yellow fever and malaria, they died and died
                                    —some survived
After thirty more years the people returned to their homeland
closer to the Skeleton Canyons where an epic scribed
on the mountain walls called back their ancestors
At night the drumming echoed like the murmur inside
Their bodies hearing the loud thumps come and go
In 1986 the people returned to their original place
                                                —entering the ancient canyons
                                                —honoring those killed
                                                —remembering the mountains
At night the sparks fly high as the people hear those rusty bells
and hollow songs        —they feel the drums and footsteps reverberate
Inside their veins every time, they look to the mountains","For the Ndé—the people who wandered into night and lost their tongues and eyes they consume the mountain. A hundred years the spirits protected them from the sixteenth calvary who then believed, in all their hearts, a good Injun was a dead Injun."
Song of the Oktahutche,"Far, far, far are my silver waters drawn;
       The hills embrace me loth to let me go;
The maidens think me fair to look upon,
       And trees lean over glad to hear me flow.
Thro’ field and valley, green because of me,
       I wander, wander to the distant sea.
Thro’ lonely places and thro’ crowded ways;
       Thro’ noise of strife and thro’ the solitude,
And on thro’ cloudy days and sunny days,
       I journey till I meet, in sisterhood,
The broad Canadian, red with the sunset,
       Now calm, now raging in a mighty fret!
On either hand, in a grand colonnade,
       The cottonwoods rise in the azure sky,
And purple mountains cast a purple shade
       As I, now grave, now laughing, pass them by;
And birds of air dip bright wings in my tide,
       In sunny reaches where I noiseless glide.
O’er shoals of mossy rocks and mussel shells,
       Blue over spacious beds of amber sand,
By cliffs and coves and glens where Echo dwells—
       Elusive spirit of the shadow-land—
Forever blest and blessing, do I go,
       A wid’ning in the morning’s roseate glow.
Though I sing my song in a minor key,
       Broad lands and fair attest the good I do;
Though I carry no white sails to the sea,
       Towns nestle in the vales I wander thro’;
And quails are whistling in the waving grain,
       And herds are scattered o’er the verdant plain.","The author writes of his journey across the world in a book called ‘Echo’ The book is a collection of short stories, poems and short stories."
Hurstonian Mythos 0.2: Custodial Spirits,"My mama, centaur-sometimes-mystic, sculpts me praying hands
I break open to score messy reminders into the flesh of a dark rock

Desperate palms in search of Zora’s feather-bed settle themselves 
around broom handles and wastebaskets. Consorts of La Madama 
surround us throwin’ whispered revivals against a spiral of owned objects.

Whitman,"I imagine him lying on his back,
gaze to the azure sky, white clouds—unlike
this grey New York on a rain-drenched day.
Notebook at his side, sheets splotched from an ink pen,
pipe in hand, hat off, wispy hair rustling in the wind.
Leaning on an elbow over wet dandelions, he slaps
at a buzzing fly. The poet reaches for language
until evening falls.
                                               At last he stands,
dusts off trousers, and heads for the pub. After an ale or two,
“Come to me,” he’ll whisper to a ginger-haired mate,
“when the gaslights grow dim.”
That was that—life, then, not fate.
Walking home, pondering the vastness of an indigo sky,
the poet falls in love,
the way old men fall in love, with unspoken desires
and hearts that break into clusters of stars;
with failing gaze, winks back at a bespectacled sight.
Illuminated streets were new.
Everything gleamed with the shine of progress,
railways and motor cars—
democracy in action. The nation belonged to men of ambition,
ladies and their heirs. He, with his rhymeless verses, pertained to no one,
or so he rigorously declared.
On a fair day a friend and he hiked through the woods,
vigorous in thought and perseverance.
They had wine and bread, clever banter. Perhaps
they swam in a river,
and while one read to the other
dried their flesh in the sun.
The poet felt young again on such days,
the feeling a treasure
to store with saved letters. 
He’d remain immortal that way,
virile in the minds of romantics.
Rhetorical questions were for lesser minds.
True pleasure came with soup served out of the kettle.
He himself had killed the turkey or duck,
plucked feathers, pulled out liver and gizzards.
Raw heart dropped on his own tongue.
Everything else went into the boiling pot.
Later, he’d call out, “It’s done!”
Meat melting off bone, potatoes and carrots
or love—which one?","I imagine him lying on his back, gaze to the azure sky, white clouds. I imagine him with a notebook at his side, sheets splotched from an ink pen. He has unspoken desires and hearts that break into clusters of stars. The poet falls in love the way old men fall in love."
"heavy altar (no elevation),","a miracle trodden. The Crystal Diggers knew it to be true: reorient devotion to ground–uncontained,
in its own order. The walls were built only to catch its slipping holy, singing dually lean on into fervor.
Praise at the collapse. Breath of Burning, weightless silver saunters in gravitational cycloning downward,
toward that which is absorbent. & for this, what can you withstand? What will you let go?","Praise at the collapse. Breath of Burning, weightless silver saunters in gravitational cycloning downward, toward that which is absorbent. & for this, what can you withstand? What will you let go?"
Drops Fell on the Roof,"                                        Translation by Tyehimba Jess with Ana Castillo
  Tic, tic, tic,
tic, tic, tic…
A stab
in the chest of the country
and the night didn’t blink
that Valentine’s Day.
A tic, tic, tic fell on the roof
and no one slept, not my love, not the dog, not me
with the news of the latest massacre.
Seventeen children lost their lives.
Students, poets, leaders of the future,
it was seventeen souls that time.
Seventeen, count them in their coffins,
that will never grow older.
Seventeen sons and daughters. Count, if you can,
the screams of the parents and the people.
Domestic terrorism so rampant
in a place that calls itself democracy,
that has made death banal. It began centuries ago.
Men with weapons, haters of humanity, lovers of power
now, they take off their masks, their costumes,
with the blessing of Mr. President. Tic, tic, tic…
drops fell from the sky, and nobody slept,
not my love, not the dog, not me.","A stab in the chest of the country and the night didn’t blink. Count, if you can, the screams of the parents and the people.Domestic terrorism so rampant in a place that calls itself democracy, that has made death banal."
Othering,"Having a light supper of peanut butter and wild berry jam
on water table crackers while watching PBS,
a woman who wrote a book came on.
She talked about married Indian women,
her curiosity about them.
They were private, at first, she said.
It took time to gain trust
and signed consents,
everything on the up and up, you understand.
How bloody “Margaret Mead” of her,
how “Jane Goodall,” I thought,
going over to make tea, draw blinds,
bring in the dogs for the night.
After all, I mused, if her subjects—
multilingual, educated, well-traveled—
wished for strangers to know
whether they watched porn,
places where they made love,
how they interacted with in-laws
and reared children,
they’d write their own accounts.
Instead, perhaps sometime
they’d document
the impudent guest
who came to town
for the sole purpose
of blabbing about all that went on
behind closed doors.","A woman who wrote a book came on PBS to talk about married Indian women. They were private, at first, she said. It took time to gain trust."
What Is Your Writing Process?,"With mop in one hand,
cocktail in the other,
at 9:00 a.m. or night,
flies swatted,
roach corpses swept.
Lola Beltrán belts “Mi ranchito”
through house speakers
from room to room.
I hum off key.
Mares fed, dogs let out,
sun beating on the flat roof,
moon rising behind a cloud—
verses take form.","Lola Beltrán belts “Mi ranchito’s” through house speakers. With mop in one hand,                cocktail in the other,                flies swatted,                roach corpses swept."
Drifting,"And now the sun in tinted splendor sank,
  The west was all aglow with crimson light;
The bay seemed like a sheet of burnished gold,
  Its waters glistened with such radiance bright.
At anchor lay the yachts with snow-white sails,
  Outlined against the glowing, rose-hued sky.
No ripple stirred the waters’ calm repose
  Save when a tiny craft sped lightly by.
Our boat was drifting slowly, gently round,
  To rest secure till evening shadows fell;
No sound disturbed the stillness of the air,
  Save the soft chiming of the vesper bell.
Yes, drifting, drifting; and I thought that life,
  When nearing death, is like the sunset sky:
And death is but the slow, sure drifting in
  To rest far more securely, by and by.
Then let me drift along the Bay of Time,
  Till my last sun shall set in glowing light;
Let me cast anchor where no shadows fall,
  Forever moored within Heaven’s harbor bright.","The west was all aglow with crimson light; the bay seemed like a sheet of burnished gold. At anchor lay the yachts with snow-white sails, outlined against the glowing, rose-hued sky."

flicker of cannas near the pane.

The White Paws,"The fox with broken legs has a gift others do not. He removes his paws and they go walking through the woods at night alone. The paws stop to touch pondwater, to brush a blade of saltgrass. They tap the backs of passing beetles in the dark. At dawn, they return to the fox, whispering of rabbits curled in damp caverns, of green oak leaves and sand. The fox listens carefully; he gleans secrets of the world this way. He learns of the earth without lifting his nose from his long, broken limbs. Always, when the paws return they say we missed you, always he listens. How young, how simple they seem beside his face which is mottled and pocked. He gentles the paws like children. He hopes when he dies they live on without him. When his bones rattle and shake in wind, he hopes the paws walk through autumn leaves, pad softly through newfallen snow. He dreams they will drift across a black lake dappled with rain; that, above it, they’ll rise; they’ll glow like four pale moons.","The fox with broken legs has a gift others do not. He removes his paws and they go walking through the woods at night alone. The paws stop to touch pondwater, to brush a blade of saltgrass."

            a tow chain for tail, train piston for hock & hoof.
Over murdered Mexica, Cortez stands: lug nut hips
& kneecaps, gauntleted hand at the sword hilt, silver
            as a knot of solder. Opposite him: the Franciscan
& his Latin cross—miter-sawed angles hewn down
to dagger point—& an angel in assembly-line armor
            lifting a bloodied banner with the stenciled letters
of an alphabet, the one I must have started learning,
sing-song in the pitch & timbre of milk teeth, at 48th
            & Willetta, a one-bedroom duplex west of Papago’s
greasewood & buttes of sandstone & a block down
from the Motorola where my grandmother punched
            in nights to look after a conveyor of semiconductors—
those nascent ancient rotaries strung up to starlight
& empire (gaslighting like that Gast painting of progress
            & whiteness wrapped in telegraph wire, lithe & looping
as cake shop box string). No wall on O’odham land,

            of a front-end loader—a Caterpillar, by her presence,
dumbstruck on tread wheels tall as vault doors, its maw
metal hollow, a confessional or old Mountain Bell

servers deep in their grid deserts to the crystalline
& rare earth minerals making my cell phone
            black box theater, making her code, making her
algorithm—both soprano & Mario Savio—the solder
seemingly quantum leap from soldada & solidarity.
            Still, I remember the ram’s horn baritone in my nana’s

picking out fences, weeds, late
flowering trees, everything
that streams back into the past
without sound, I smell the grass
and the rich chemical sleep
of the fields. An open moon
sails above, and a stalk
of red lights blinks, miles away.
It is at such moments I 
am called, in a voice so pure
I have to close my eyes, and enter
the breathing darkness just beyond
my headlights. I have come back,
to think, to something I had
almost forgotten, a mouth
that waits patiently, sighs, speaks
and falls silent. No one else
is alive. The blossoms are
white, and I am almost there. ","Take me as I drive alone                through the dark countryside. I smell the grass and the rich chemical sleep                of the fields. An open moon                sails above, and a stalk                of red lights blinks, miles away."
There,"It is deep summer. Far out
at sea, the young squalls darken
and roll, plunging northward,
threatening everything. I see
the Atlantic moving in slow
contemplative fury
against the rocks, the beaten
headlands, and the towns sunk deep
in a blind northern light. Here, 
far inland, in the mountains
of Mexico, it is raining
hard, battering the soft mouths
of flowers. I am sullen, dumb,
ungovernable. I taste myself
and I taste those winds, uprisings
of salt and ice, of great trees
brought down, of houses and cries
lost in the storm; and what breaks
on that black shore breaks in me. ","It is deep summer. Far out at sea, the young squalls darken and roll, plunging northward. I am sullen, dumb,                ungovernable. I taste myself and I taste those winds."
After Hours,"Not yet five, and the light
is going fast. Milky and veined
a thin frost covers the flooded 
ruts of the driveway, the grass
bends to the winter night. Her face
is before me now; I see it
in the misted glass, the same
impossible smile and I can feel
again on my bare shoulder
the dew of her breath. We made
a life in two years, a sky
and the very trees, lost in thought.
I know what it is, to be 
alone, to have asked for everything, 
and to do without, to search
the air for a face that slipped away,
to wait, and what it exacts.
I don’t fear it, I say,
but I do, and this night
the wind against the window
and the top branches thrashing about
enter my life and I see
the coming time loose and dark
above me, with new strength.","Not yet five, and the light                is going fast.

A Bedtime Story,"Accidents will happen. Still, in time,
The rigors of mortality will chill
The piping channels of the blood and spin
Around the brain a cold and covering skin.
Then one might not remember pain so well;
One could sit back, and life, if not sublime,
Would be a sleep to dream pleasantly in,
Enlarging on the heroics of one’s prime.
Nothing about longevity is heroic.
When he was eighty, Sophocles sighed, and said,
“This well loved instrument’s finally out of tune.
Well, I am old, and have my work.” And soon
Wrote Oedipus Rex, but in the night, in bed—
Well, it would test the most brave, the most stoic:
His genitals were wrinkled as a prune,
His nerves gone dull and every thought prosaic.
Then there was Stanley Ketchel, whose reckless love
And subsequent early death preserved his youth
And left his classic body middleweight slim.
Graceful and powerful we remember him,
His battering fists telling the brutal truth.
But there are countless tales. It is enough
To learn the fate of vigorous life and limb
And lose it in grandiose rough stuff.
Ah, if only the dawn had thought to ask
For something more, for supple muscles, say,
An ageless heart to keep the flesh and blood
Robust as well as living for the good
Of her fair-haired boy, who came to hate the day,
The endless afternoon, the endless dusk,
That left him frozen in his fossilhood,
His deathless eyes bright in his bitten mask.
The specter of an old man’s ugly phiz
Drifts in the gloom, wearing a dreadful smile.
Regard this silly ghost as he goes by:
Was he not thoughtless once as you and I
Of what must happen in a little while,
Who now despairs that he is come to this?
Shall you and I instruct him how to die?
Come close, come closer, kill me with a kiss.
 ","When he was eighty, Sophocles sighed, and said, “This well loved instrument’s finally out of tune.” And soon after, in bed, he wrote: “Come close, come closer, kill me with a kiss”"
The Funeral Home,"In the environs of the funeral home
The smell of death was absent. All there was
Was flowers rioting, the odors blown
Palpable as a blossom into the face,
To be crushed, to overpower—as if the grass
Already covered the nostrils in that place.

Hyacinths, larkspur, irises, flags of summer
Freshening and quickening in the little
Dawn breeze, and opening to a bee’s clamor
The delicate parts, just now fragrantly ready,
And now beginning to die, the damp petal
Swaying a little with the weight of the bee’s body—

Let them cut these flowers. Let them be ruddy
And sunlit gold and white and let them be
Heaped up and overflowing over the body
Waiting to be put down. To be unborn.
Something is sprouting in dark mahogany
Out of them—edged, and shining like a thorn.
   ",The smell of death was absent. All there was was the smell of flowers. Let them be ruddy and white and let them be put down.
Twilight Pain,"I have died so many midnight moons,
most of night soil not realized until later.
In peculiar sleep, caught by a night-latched
mind like some dark dew on the breaching hips,
resemble a red blossom, birth & blood is the rose.
I pang & I hurt but a summons in black snow,
of ukpik, calls as white snow owls on black earth melt,
our catching eyes lock in deadbolt time & ukpik calls
moonlight across tundra, on a level plain
with a photoreceptor stimulated by light
floating to the blue hue of dawn.
At daybreak, my night person fades,
my drowsiness & lethargic body
rises to alleviate the deep
nightlong pain of restlessness.
It’s the light through purple celestial bodies
belonging to the daytime,
diurnal cycle, of wavelengths dancing
in & out nightmarish, lunacy.
Dancing with my namesake, there.
Living in the sienna’s myriad
mazes lost beyond found, alive but mostly dead.
I am brushstrokes of a painting half-finished.
What is not clear to me is the order
by which humans now go by.
Sometimes my tunicate, saclike body
fills with ill plague.
Illness disperses, dispels, vanishes in paint on a canvas
no different than multicolored wildflowers.
Distinguished only to a few,
not all flowers accounted for or named just yet.
There for a reason. I don’t know why,
how, when they came,
when they chose to leave
but I do know & wait.
I live in a dugout in the cliffs next to the ocean,
bluffs receding filling with seawater rising
from melting glacial ice. Across the inlet seal island
not far from my dugout.
They bark and sun themselves all day,
but are in constant fear of losing ground to walrus.
The tons of blubber could squash a seal
out of sheer creature comfort.
Walrus take over any small island
rolling around in the sand;
waiting for the coming schools of fish
voraciously hungry, grunting to the sway of wind,
sea of the long twilight hours.","I live in a dugout in the cliffs next to the ocean, receding filling with seawater rising from melting glacial ice.

As if my body—
subdued
by brittle, gutter, brim
ice. Finding a chickadee’s
feather on a snowflake,
while lost in slumberous,
smooth, blue, smoke.

At Crow's Nest Pass,"At Crow’s Nest Pass the mountains rend
Themselves apart, the rivers wend
    A lawless course about their feet, 
    And breaking into torrents beat
In useless fury where they blend
    At Crow’s Nest Pass. 
The nesting eagle, wise, discreet, 
Wings up the gorge’s lone retreat
And makes some barren crag her friend
    At Crow's Nest Pass. 
Uncertain clouds, half-high, suspend
Their shifting vapours, and contend
   With rocks that suffer not defeat; 
   And snows, and suns, and mad winds meet
To battle where the cliffs defend
   At Crow’s Nest Pass. ","At Crow’s Nest Pass the mountains rend themselves apart, the rivers wend                    A lawless course about their feet, and breaking into torrents beat                . The nesting eagle, wise, discreet,                 Wings up the gorge's lone retreat."
The City and the Sea,"                       I 

To none the city bends a servile knee; 
   Purse-proud and scornful, on her heights she stands, 
And at her feet the great white moaning sea 
   Shoulders incessantly the grey-gold sands,—
One the Almighty’s a child since time began, 
   And one the might of Mammon, born of clods; 
For all the city is the work of man, 
   But all the sea is God’s. 

                       II

And she—between the ocean and the town—
   Lies cursed of one and by the other blest: 
Her staring eyes, her long drenched hair, her gown, 
   Sea-laved and soiled and dank above her breast. 
She, image of her God since life began, 
   She, but the child of Mammon, born of clods, 
Her broken body spoiled and spurned of man, 
   But her sweet soul is God’s. ","The city is the work of man, but all the sea is God’s. She is the child of Mammon, born of clods, and her broken body spoiled and spurned of man."
Good-Bye,"Sounds of the seas grow fainter,
   Sounds of the sands have sped; 
The sweep of gales,
The far white sails, 
   Are silent, spent and dead. 

Sounds of the days of summer
   Murmur and die away, 
And distance hides
The long, low tides, 
  As night shuts out the day. ","Sounds of the seas grow fainter. Sounds of the sands have sped. The sweep of gales are silent. The far white sails are silent, spent and dead."
The Flight of the Crows,"The autumn afternoon is dying o’er
   The quiet western valley where I lie
Beneath the maples on the river shore,
   Where tinted leaves, blue waters and fair sky
   Environ all; and far above some birds are flying by

To seek their evening haven in the breast
   And calm embrace of silence, while they sing
Te Deums to the night, invoking rest
   For busy chirping voice and tired wing—
   And in the hush of sleeping trees their sleeping cradles swing.

In forest arms the night will soonest creep,
   Where sombre pines a lullaby intone,
Where Nature’s children curl themselves to sleep,
   And all is still at last, save where alone
   A band of black, belated crows arrive from lands unknown.

Strange sojourn has been theirs since waking day,
   Strange sights and cities in their wanderings blend
With fields of yellow maize, and leagues away
   With rivers where their sweeping waters wend
   Past velvet banks to rocky shores, in cañons bold to end.

O’er what vast lakes that stretch superbly dead,
   Till lashed to life by storm-clouds, have they flown?
In what wild lands, in laggard flight have led
   Their aërial career unseen, unknown,
   ’Till now with twilight come their cries in lonely monotone?

The flapping of their pinions in the air
   Dies in the hush of distance, while they light
Within the fir tops, weirdly black and bare,
   That stand with giant strength and peerless height,
   To shelter fairy, bird and beast throughout the closing night.

Strange black and princely pirates of the skies,
   Would that your wind-tossed travels I could know!
Would that my soul could see, and, seeing, rise
   To unrestricted life where ebb and flow
   Of Nature’s pulse would constitute a wider life below!

Could I but live just here in Freedom’s arms,
   A kingly life without a sovereign’s care!
Vain dreams! Day hides with closing wings her charms,
   And all is cradled in repose, save where
   Yon band of black, belated crows still frets the evening air.","A band of black, belated crows arrive from lands unknown. They sing Te Deums to the night, invoking rest and rest for the day."

Erie Waters,"A dash of yellow sand,
Wind-scattered and sun-tanned;
Some waves that curl and cream along the margin of the strand;
And, creeping close to these
Long shores that lounge at ease,
Old Erie rocks and ripples to a fresh sou’-western breeze.
A sky of blue and grey;
Some stormy clouds that play
At scurrying up with ragged edge, then laughing blow away,
Just leaving in their trail
Some snatches of a gale;
To whistling summer winds we lift a single daring sail.
O! wind so sweet and swift,
O! danger-freighted gift
Bestowed on Erie with her waves that foam and fall and lift,
We laugh in your wild face,
And break into a race
With flying clouds and tossing gulls that weave and interlace.","A dash of yellow sand,                Wind-scattered and sun-tanned;                Some waves that curl and cream along the margin of the strand;                Long shores that lounge at ease,                Old Erie rocks and ripples to a fresh sou'-western breeze."

But rich in tawny coloring of her race,

    Ere might's injustice banished from their lands
Her people, that to-day unheeded lie,

Lullaby of the Iroquois,"Little born baby-bird, lapped in your nest,
      Wrapped in your nest,
      Strapped in your nest,
Your straight little cradle-board rocks you to rest;

      Its bands are your nest;

You watch the camp flame, and the curling grey smoke;
But, oh, for your pretty black eyes sleep is best,—
Little brown baby of mind, go to rest.

      Winging to sleep,

The night-owl calls from his haunt on the hill,
Afar the fox barks, afar the stars peep,—
Little brown baby of mine, go to sleep.","Little born baby-bird, lapped in your nest, wrapped in its nest. Little brown baby of mind, go to rest. The heron is homing, the plover is still, the night-owl calls."

The shore is but a purple rim,
The sea outstretches grey and grim.

Beyond the Blue,"I
Speak of you, sir? You bet he did. Ben Fields was far too sound
To go back on a fellow just because he weren't around.
Why, sir, he thought a lot of you, and only three months back
Says he, ""The Squire will some time come a-snuffing out our track
And give us the surprise."" And so I got to thinking then
That any day you might drop down on Rove, and me, and Ben.
And now you've come for nothing, for the lad has left us two,
And six long weeks ago, sir, he went up beyond the blue.
Who's Rove? Oh, he's the collie, and the only thing on earth
That I will ever love again. Why, Squire, that dog is worth
More than you ever handled, and that's quite a piece, I know.
Ah, there the beggar is!—come here, you scalawag! and show
Your broken leg all bandaged up. Yes, sir, it's pretty sore;
I did it,—curse me,—and I think I feel the pain far more
Than him, for somehow I just feel as if I'd been untrue
To what my brother said before he went beyond the blue.
You see, the day before he died he says to me, ""Say, Ned,
Be sure you take good care of poor old Rover when I'm dead,
And maybe he will cheer your lonesome hours up a bit,
And when he takes to you just see that you're deserving it.""
Well, Squire, it wasn't any use. I tried, but couldn't get
The friendship of that collie, for I needed it, you bet.
I might as well have tried to get the moon to help me through,
For Rover's heart had gone with Ben, 'way up beyond the blue.
He never seemed to take to me nor follow me about,
For all I coaxed and petted, for my heart was starving out
For want of some companionship,—I thought, if only he
Would lick my hand or come and put his head aside my knee,
Perhaps his touch would scatter something of the gloom away.
But all along I had to live until there came a day
When, tired of the battle, as you'd have tired too,
I wished to heaven I'd gone with Ben, 'way up beyond the blue.
* * *
One morning I took out Ben's gun, and though I'd hunt all day,
And started through the cleaning for the bush that forward lay,
When something made me look around—I scarce believed my mind—
But, sure enough, the dog was following right close behind.
A feeling first of joy, and than a sharper, greater one
Of anger came, at knowing 'twas not me, but Ben's old gun,
That Rover was after,—well, sir, I just don't mind telling you,
But I forgot that moment Ben was up beyond the blue.
Perhaps it was but jealousy—perhaps it was despair,
But I just struck him with the gun and broke the bone right there;
And then, my very throat seemed choked, for he began to whine
With pain—God knows how tenderly I took that dog of mine
Up in my arms, and tore my old red necktie into bands
To bind the broken leg, while there he lay and licked my hands;
And though I cursed my soul, it was the brightest day I knew,
Or even cared to live, since Ben went up beyond the blue.
I tell you, Squire, I nursed him just as gently as could be,
And now I'm all the world to him, and he's the world to me.
Look, sir, at that big, noble soul, right in his faithful eyes,
The square, forgiving honestly that deep down in them lies.
Eh, Squire? What's that you say? He's got no should? I tell you, then,
He's grander and the's better than the mass of what's called men;
And I guess he stands a better chance that many of us do
Of seeing Ben some day again, 'way up beyond the blue.","Ben Fields was far too sound to go back on a fellow just because he weren't around.

Easter,"Lent gathers up her cloak of sombre shading
    In her reluctant hands.
Her beauty heightens, fairest in its fading,
    As pensively she stands 
Awaiting Easter’s benediction falling,
    Like silver stars at night, 
Before she can obey the summons calling
    Her to her upward flight, 
Awaiting Easter’s wings that she must borrow
    Ere she can hope to fly—
Those glorious wings that we shall see to-morrow
    Against the far, blue sky.
Has not the purple of her vesture’s lining
    Brought calm and rest to all? 
Has her dark robe had naught of golden shining
    Been naught but pleasure’s pall?
Who knows? Perhaps when to the world returning
    In youth’s light joyousness,
We’ll wear some rarer jewels we found burning
    In Lent’s black-bordered dress.
So hand in hand with fitful March she lingers
    To beg the crowning grace 
Of lifting with her pure and holy fingers
    The veil from April’s face. 
Sweet, rosy April—laughing, sighing, waiting
    Until the gateway swings,
And she and Lent can kiss between the grating
    Of Easter’s tissue wings.
Too brief the bliss—the parting comes with sorrow. 
    Good-bye dear Lent, good-bye! 
We’ll watch your fading wings outlined to-morrow
     Against the far blue sky. ","Lent gathers up her cloak of sombre shading in her reluctant hands. Lent’s beauty heightens, fairest in its fading, as pensively she stands. The parting comes with sorrow."
The Songster,"Music, music with throb and swing, 
   Of a plaintive note, and long; 
’Tis a note no human throat could sing, 
No harp with its dulcet golden string,—
Nor lute, nor lyre with liquid ring, 
   Is sweet as the robin’s song. 

He sings for the love of the season
   When the days grow warm and long, 
For the beautiful God-sent reason
   That his breast was born for song. 

Calling, calling so fresh and clear, 
   Through the song-sweet days of May; 
Warbling there, and whistling here, 
He swells his voice on the drinking ear, 
On the great, wide, pulsing atmosphere
   ’Till his music drowns the day.

Navajo Mountain,"If you close your eyes
and take a deep breath
you can hear the green sage sing
The gray stones beneath you
feel young again
The breeze watches
it all with her Mona Lisa smile
Naatsis’áán takes it all in
The thunder of a hundred hooves,
whoops and hollers of the crowd,
the intensity of the riders
as in the day of wild warriors 
on the warpath.
There are chicken pulls, children’s foot races,
Navajo cake, kneel-down bread, drum songs
K’é shakes the roots of the mountain,
which gives the people her blessing
as does Sun God
with gentle warm breath.
The story I heard
was that the people
returned from Hwéeldi
and found strangers in their home.
Ashiih Litso just a boy, risked everything
on one horse race
and was blessed by the Holy People.
Another story goes that the mountain protected the people,
keeping soldiers away
and they never had to make the Long Walk.
Whichever story you live by,
the mountain remembers.

Workworn,"Across the street, an humble woman lives;
To her ’tis little fortune ever gives;
Denied the wines of life, it puzzles me
To know how she can laugh so cheerily.
This morn I listened to her softly sing,
And, marvelling what this effect could bring
I looked: ’twas but the presence of a child
Who passed her gate, and looking in, had smiled.
But self-encrusted, I had failed to see
The child had also looked and laughed to me.
My lowly neighbour thought the smile God-sent,
And singing, through the toilsome hours she went.
O! weary singer, I have learned the wrong
Of taking gifts, and giving naught of song;
I thought my blessings scant, my mercies few,
Till I contrasted them with yours, and you;
To-day I counted much, yet wished it more—
While but a child’s bright smile was all your store,
If I had thought of all the stormy days,
That fill some lives that tread less favoured ways,
How little sunshine through their shadows gleamed,
My own dull life had much the brighter seemed;
If I had thought of all the eyes that weep
Through desolation, and still smiling keep,
That see so little pleasure, so much woe,
My own had laughed more often long ago;
If I had thought how leaden was the weight
Adversity lays at my kinsman’s gate,
Of that great cross my next door neighbour bears,
My thanks had been more frequent in my prayers;
If I had watched the woman o’er the way,
Workworn and old, who labours day by day,
Who has no rest, no joy to call her own,
My tasks, my heart, had much the lighter grown.","The writer was inspired to write after hearing his neighbour sing in the street. He describes how a child's smile brought a smile to his neighbour's face, and how his own life had been brighter."
At Husking Time,"At husking time the tassel fades
To brown above the yellow blades,
    Whose rustling sheath enswathes the corn
    That bursts its chrysalis in scorn
Longer to lie in prison shades.

Among the merry lads and maids
The creaking ox-cart slowly wades
Twixt stalks and stubble, sacked and torn
At husking time.

The prying pilot crow persuades
The flock to join in thieving raids;
The sly racoon with craft inborn
His portion steals; from plenty’s horn
His pouch the saucy chipmunk lades

The Camper,"Night ’neath the northern skies, lone, black, and grim:
Naught but the starlight lies ’twixt heaven, and him.
Of man no need has he, of God, no prayer;
He and his Deity are brothers there. 
Above his bivouac the firs fling down 
Through branches gaunt and black, their needles brown. 
    
Afar some mountain streams, rockbound and fleet
Sing themselves through his dreams in cadence sweet,
The pine trees whispering, the heron’s cry,
The plover’s passing wing, his lullaby. 
And blinking overhead the white stars keep
Watch o’er his hemlock bed—his sinless sleep.","The author writes of a man who sleeps in a bivouac under the northern skies. The pine trees whispering, the heron's cry, the plover's passing wing, are his lullaby, he writes."
Low Tide at St. Andrews,"(New Brunswick)
The long red flats stretch open to the sky,
Breathing their moisture on the August air.
The seaweeds cling with flesh-like fingers where
The rocks give shelter that the sands deny;
And wrapped in all her summer harmonies
St. Andrews sleeps beside her sleeping seas.
The far-off shores swim blue and indistinct,
Like half-lost memories of some old dream.
The listless waves that catch each sunny gleam
Are idling up the waterways land-linked,
And, yellowing along the harbour's breast,
The light is leaping shoreward from the west.
And naked-footed children, tripping down,
Light with young laughter, daily come at eve
To gather pulse and sea clams and then heave
Their loads, returning laden to the town,
Leaving a strange grey silence when they go,—
The silence of the sands when tides are low.","The long red flats stretch open to the sky, breathing their moisture on the August air. The listless waves that catch each sunny gleam are idling up the waterways land-linked."
Lady Lorgnette,"I
Lady Lorgnette, of the lifted lash,
    The curling lip and the dainty nose,
The shell-like ear where the jewels flash,
    The arching brow and the languid pose,
The rare old lace and the subtle scents,
    The slender foot and the fingers frail,—
I may act till the world grows wild and tense,
    But never a flush on your features pale.
The footlights glimmer between us two,—
    You in the box and I on the boards,—
I am only an actor, Madame, to you,
    A mimic king 'mid his mimic lords,
For you are the belle of the smartest set,

Little Babette, with your eyes of jet,
     Your midnight hair and your piquant chin,
Your lips whose odors of violet
   Drive men to madness and saints to sin,—
I see you over the footlights' glare
    Down in the pit 'mid the common mob,—
Your throat is burning, and brown, and bare,
    You lean, and listen, and pulse, and throb;
The viols are dreaming between us two,

Harvest Time,"Pillowed and hushed on the silent plain,
Wrapped in her mantle of golden grain,
Wearied of pleasuring weeks away,
Summer is lying asleep to-day,—
Where winds come sweet from the wild-rose briers
And the smoke of the far-off prairies fires;
Yellow her hair as the golden rod,
And brown her cheeks as the prairie sod;
Purple her eyes as the mists that dram
At the edge of some laggard sun-drowned stream;
But over their depths the lashes sweep,
For Summer is lying to-day asleep.
The north wind kisses her rosy mouth,
His rival frowns in the far-off south,
And comes caressing her sunburnt cheek,
And Summer awakes for one short week,—
Awakes and gathers her wealth of grain,
Then sleeps and dreams for a year again.",Summer is lying asleep to-day. Pillowed and hushed on the silent plain. Wrapped in her mantle of golden grain. Wearing a dress.
Where Leaps the Ste. Marie,"I
What dream you in the night-time
    When you whisper to the moon?
What say you in the morning?
    What do you sing at noon?
When I hear your voice uplifting,
    Like a breeze through branches sifting,
And your ripples softly drifting
    To the August airs-tune.
II
Lend me your happy laughter,
    Ste. Marie, as you leap;
Your peace that follows after
    Where through the isles you creep.
Give to me your splendid dashing,
    Give your sparkles and your splashing,
Your uphurling waves down crashing,
    Then, your aftermath of sleep.","I dream of you in the night-time, when you whisper to the moon. I hear your voice uplifting, like a breeze through branches sifting. Give to me your splendid dashing, your sparkling sparkles and your splashing."
Canadian Born,"We first saw light in Canada, the land beloved of God;
We are the pulse of Canada, its marrow and its blood:
And we, the men of Canada, can face the world and brag
That we were born in Canada beneath the British flag.
Few of us have the blood of kings, few are courtly birth,
But few are vagabonds or rogues of doubtful name and worth;
And all have one credential that entitles us to brag—
That we were born in Canada beneath the British flag.
We've yet to make our money, we've yet to make our fame,
But we have gold and glory in our clean colonial name;
And every man's a millionaire if only he can brag
That he was born in Canada beneath the British flag.
No title and no coronet is half so proudly worn
As that which we inherited as men Canadian born.
We could no man so noble as the one who makes the brag
That he was born in Canada beneath the British flag.
The Dutch may have their Holland, the Spaniard have his Spain,
The Yankee to the south of us must south of us remain;
For not a man dare lift a hand against the men who brag
That they were born in Canada beneath the British flag.","We are the pulse of Canada, its marrow and its blood, the men of Canada say.

The Song My Paddle Sings,"West wind, blow from your prairie nest,
Blow from the mountains, blow from the west
The sail is idle, the sailor too;
O! wind of the west, we wait for you.
Blow, blow!
I have wooed you so,
But never a favour you bestow.
You rock your cradle the hills between,
But scorn to notice my white lateen.
I stow the sail, unship the mast:
I wooed you long but my wooing’s past;
My paddle will lull you into rest.
O! drowsy wind of the drowsy west,
Sleep, sleep,
By your mountain steep,
Or down where the prairie grasses sweep!
Now fold in slumber your laggard wings,
For soft is the song my paddle sings.
August is laughing across the sky,
Laughing while paddle, canoe and I,
Drift, drift,
Where the hills uplift
On either side of the current swift.
The river rolls in its rocky bed;
My paddle is plying its way ahead;
Dip, dip,
While the waters flip
In foam as over their breast we slip.
And oh, the river runs swifter now;
The eddies circle about my bow.
Swirl, swirl!
How the ripples curl
In many a dangerous pool awhirl!
And forward far the rapids roar,
Fretting their margin for evermore.
Dash, dash,
With a mighty crash,
They seethe, and boil, and bound, and splash.
Be strong, O paddle! be brave, canoe!
The reckless waves you must plunge into.
Reel, reel.
On your trembling keel,
But never a fear my craft will feel.
We’ve raced the rapid, we’re far ahead!
The river slips through its silent bed.
Sway, sway,
As the bubbles spray
And fall in tinkling tunes away.
And up on the hills against the sky,
A fir tree rocking its lullaby,
Swings, swings,
Its emerald wings,
Swelling the song that my paddle sings.",The poem was written in the early 1990s. It is set in the Canadian prairie. The author is a former canoeist. The poem is set against the backdrop of the Canadian Rockies.
Man Hesitates but Life Urges,"There is this shifting, endless film
And I have followed it down the valleys
And over the hills,—
Pointing with wavering finger
When it disappeared in purple forest-patches
With its ruffle and wave to the slightest-breathing wind-God.
There is this film
Seen suddenly, far off,
When the sun, walking to his setting,
Turns back for a last look,
And out there on the far, far prairie
A lonely drowsing cabin catches and holds a glint,
For one how endless moment,
In a staring window the fire and song of the martyrs!
There is this film
That has passed to my fingers
And I have trembled,
Afraid to touch.
And in the eyes of one
Who had wanted to give what I had asked
But hesitated—tried—and then
Came with a weary, aged, “Not quite,”
I could but see that single realmless point of time,
All that is sad, and tired, and old—
And endless, shifting film.
And I went again
Down the valleys and over the hills,
Pointing with wavering finger,
Ever reaching to touch, trembling,
Ever fearful to touch.","There is this shifting, endless film                And I have followed it down the valleys                And over the hills.                Pointing with wavering finger                When it disappeared in purple forest-patches.                With its ruffle and wave to the slightest-breathing wind-God.                And in the eyes of one                Who had wanted to give what I had asked but hesitated."
Golden—Of the Selkirks,"A trail upwinds from Golden; 
It leads to a land God only knows,
To the land of eternal frozen snows,
That trail unknown and olden. 

And they tell a tale that is strange and wild—
Of a lovely and lonely mountain child
That went up the train from Golden. 

A child in the sweet of her womanhood,
Beautiful, tender, grave and good
As the saints in time long olden. 

And the days count not, nor the weeks avail;
For the child that went up the mountain trail
Came never again to Golden. 

And the watchers wept in the midnight gloom, 
Where the cañons yawn and the Selkirks loom, 
For the love that they knew of olden. 

And April dawned, with its suns aflame, 
And the eagles wheeled and the vultures came
And poised o’er the town of Golden. 

God of the white eternal peaks, 
Guard the dead while the vulture seeks!—
God of the days so olden. 

For only God in His greatness knows,
Where the mountain holly above her grows, 
On the trail that leads from Golden. ",A trail upwinds from Golden leads to a land God only knows. The watchers wept in the midnight gloom. The eagles wheeled and the vultures came.
The Vagabonds,"What saw you in your flight to-day,
Crows awinging your homeward way?

Went you far in carrion quest,
Crows that worry the sunless west?

Thieves and villains, you shameless things
Black your record as black your wings.

Tell me, birds of the inky hue,
Plunderous rogues—to-day have you
Seen with mischievous, prying eyes
Lands where earlier suns arise?  

Saw you a lazy beck between
Trees that shadow its breast in green,    

Teased by obstinate stones that lie 
Crossing the current tauntingly?

Fields abloom on the farther side       
With purpling clover lying wide—

Saw you there as you circled by,
Vale-environed a cottage lie,

Girt about with emerald bands, 
Nestling down in its meadow lands?

Saw you this on your thieving raids?
Speak—you rascally renegades!

Thieved you also away from me
Olden scenes that I long to see?

If, O! crows, you have flown since morn
Over the place where I was born,           

Forget will I, how black you were     
Since dawn, in feather and character;   

Absolve will I, your vagrant band,         
Ere you enter your slumberland.","Crows awinging your homeward way? What saw you in your flight to-day, birds of the inky hue,                Plunderous rogues—to-day have you seen with mischievous, prying eyes?"
My English Letter,"When each white moon, her lantern idly swinging
    Comes out to join the star night-watching band,
Across the grey-green sea, a ship is bringing
    For me a letter, from the Motherland.
Naught would I care to live in quaint old Britain,
    These wilder shores are dearer far to me,
Yet when I read the words that hand has written,
    The parent sod more precious seems to be.
Within that folded note I catch the savour
    Of climes that make the Motherland so fair,
Although I never knew the blessed favour
    That surely lies in breathing English air.
Imagination’s brush before me fleeing,
    Paints English pictures, though my longing eyes
Have never known the blessedness of seeing
    The blue that lines the arch of English skies.
And yet my letter brings the scenes I covet,
    Framed in the salt sea winds, aye more in dreams
I almost see the face that bent above it,
    I almost touch that hand, so near it seems.
Near, for the very grey-green sea that dashes
    ’Round these Canadian coasts, rolls out once more
To Eastward, and the same Atlantic splashes
    Her wild white spray on England’s distant shore.
Near, for the same young moon so idly swinging
    Her threadlike crescent bends the selfsame smile
On that old land from whence a ship is bringing
    My message from the transatlantic Isle.
Thus loves my heart that far old country better,
    Because of those dear words that always come,
With love enfolded in each English letter
    That drifts into my sun-kissed Western home.","Naught would I care to live in quaint old Britain. These wilder shores are dearer far to me. Yet when I read the words that hand has written, The parent sod more precious seems to be."
The Happy Hunting Grounds,"Into the rose gold westland, its yellow prairies roll,
World of the bison’s freedom, home of the Indian’s soul.
Roll out, O seas! in sunlight bathed,
Your plains wind-tossed, and grass enswathed.
Farther than vision ranges, farther than eagles fly,
Stretches the land of beauty, arches the perfect sky,
Hemm’d through the purple mists afar
By peaks that gleam like star on star.
Fringing the prairie billows, fretting horizon’s line,
Darkly green are slumb’ring wildernesses of pine,
Sleeping until the zephyrs throng
To kiss their silence into song.
Whispers freighted with odour swinging into the air,
Russet needles as censers swing to an altar, where
The angels’ songs are less divine
Than duo sung twixt breeze and pine.
Laughing into the forest, dimples a mountain stream,
Pure as the airs above it, soft as a summer dream,
O! Lethean spring thou’rt only found
Within this ideal hunting ground.
Surely the great Hereafter cannot be more than this,
Surely we’ll see that country after Time’s farewell kiss.
Who would his lovely faith condole?
Who envies not the Red-skin’s soul,
Sailing into the cloud land, sailing into the sun,
Into the crimson portals ajar when life is done?
O! dear dead race, my spirit too
Would fain sail westward unto you.","The song is set in the westland of North America. It is written in the style of a folk song. The lyrics include the words: 'O! dear dead race, my spirit too would fain sail westward unto you'"
Re-Voyage,"What of the days when we two dreamed together?
    Days marvellously fair,
As lightsome as a skyward floating feather
    Sailing on summer air—
Summer, summer, that came drifting through
Fate’s hand to me, to you.
What of the days, my dear? I sometimes wonder
    If you too wish this sky
Could be the blue we sailed so softly under,
    In that sun-kissed July;
Sailed in the warm and yellow afternoon,
With hearts in touch and tune.
Have you no longing to re-live the dreaming,
    Adrift in my canoe?
To watch my paddle blade all wet and gleaming
    Cleaving the waters through?
To lie wind-blown and wave-caressed, until
Your restless pulse grows still?
Do you not long to listen to the purling
    Of foam athwart the keel?
To hear the nearing rapids softly swirling
    Among their stones, to feel
The boat’s unsteady tremor as it braves
The wild and snarling waves?
What need of question, what of your replying?
    Oh! well I know that you
Would toss the world away to be but lying
    Again in my canoe,
In listless indolence entranced and lost,
Wave-rocked, and passion tossed.
Ah me! my paddle failed me in the steering
    Across love’s shoreless seas;
All reckless, I had ne’er a thought of fearing
    Such dreary days as these.
When through the self-same rapids we dash by,
My lone canoe and I.",I sometimes wonder if you too wish this sky could be the blue we sailed under. What of the days when we two dreamed together? I know that you would toss the world away to be but lying in my canoe.
Penserosa,"Soulless is all humanity to me
To-night. My keenest longing is to be
Alone, alone with God’s grey earth that seems
Pulse of my pulse and consort of my dreams.
To-night my soul desires no fellowship,
Or fellow-being; crave I but to slip
Thro’ space on space, till flesh no more can bind,
And I may quit for aye my fellow kind.
Let me but feel athwart my cheek the lash
Of whipping wind, but hear the torrent dash
Adown the mountain steep, ’twere more my choice
Than touch of human hand, than human voice.
Let me but wander on the shore night-stilled,
Drinking its darkness till my soul is filled;
The breathing of the salt sea on my hair,
My outstretched hands but grasping empty air.
Let me but feel the pulse of Nature’s soul
Athrob on mine, let seas and thunders roll
O’er night and me; sands whirl; winds, waters beat;
For God’s grey earth has no cheap counterfeit.",Soulless is all humanity to me. My keenest longing is to be alone with God’s grey earth that seems to be the pulse of my pulse.
The Birds' Lullaby,"                                  I
Sing to us, cedars; the twilight is creeping
    With shadowy garments, the wilderness through;
All day we have carolled, and now would be sleeping,
    So echo the anthems we warbled to you;
               While we swing, swing,
               And your branches sing,
        And we drowse to your dreamy whispering.
                                  II
Sing to us, cedars; the night-wind is sighing,
    Is wooing, is pleading, to hear you reply;
And here in your arms we are restfully lying,
    And longing to dream to your soft lullaby;
               While we swing, swing,
               And your branches sing.
        And we drowse to your dreamy whispering.

Sing to us, cedars; your voice is so lowly,
    Your breathing so fragrant, your branches so strong;
Our little nest-cradles are swaying so slowly,
    While zephyrs are breathing their slumberous song.

At Sunset,"To-night the west o’er-brims with warmest dyes;
Its chalice overflows
With pools of purple colouring the skies,
Aflood with gold and rose;
And some hot soul seems throbbing close to mine,
As sinks the sun within that world of wine.
I seem to hear a bar of music float
And swoon into the west;
My ear can scarcely catch the whispered note,
But something in my breast
Blends with that strain, till both accord in one,
As cloud and colour blend at set of sun.
And twilight comes with grey and restful eyes,
As ashes follow flame.
But O! I heard a voice from those rich skies
Call tenderly my name;
It was as if some priestly fingers stole
In benedictions o’er my lonely soul.
I know not why, but all my being longed
And leapt at that sweet call;
My heart outreached its arms, all passion thronged
And beat against Fate’s wall,
Crying in utter homesickness to be
Near to a heart that loves and leans to me.",The poem was written in the first half of the 20th century. It was written by a man who had lost his wife in a car crash. The author is now living in the UK.
Under Canvas,"In Muskoka
Lichens of green and grey on every side;
And green and grey the rocks beneath our feet;
Above our heads the canvas stretching wide;
And over all, enchantment rare and sweet.
Fair Rosseau slumbers in an atmosphere
That kisses her to passionless soft dreams.
O! joy of living we have found thee here,
And life lacks nothing, so complete it seems.
The velvet air, stirred by some elfin wings,
Comes swinging up the waters and then stills
Its voice so low that floating by it sings
Like distant harps among the distant hills.
Across the lake the rugged islands lie.
Fir-crowned and grim; and further in the view
Some shadows seeming swung ’twixt cloud and sky,
Are countless shores, a symphony of blue.
Some northern sorceress, when day is done,
Hovers where cliffs uplift their gaunt grey steeps,
Bewitching to vermilion Rosseau’s sun,
That in a liquid mass of rubies sleeps.
The scent of burning leaves, the camp-fire’s blaze,
The great logs cracking in the brilliant flame,
The groups grotesque, on which the firelight plays,
Are pictures which Muskoka twilights frame.
And Night, star-crested, wanders up the mere
With opiates for idleness to quaff,
And while she ministers, far off I hear
The owl’s uncanny cry, the wild loon’s laugh.","The author is the author of the book ""The Art of War and Peace"" The book is based on a novel by the same name, written in the early 1980s. It is about a group of young people who live in a small town in northern Canada."
Rainfall,"From out the west, where darkling storm-clouds float,
The ’waking wind pipes soft its rising note.
From out the west, o’erhung with fringes grey,
The wind preludes with sighs its roundelay,
Then blowing, singing, piping, laughing loud,
It scurries on before the grey storm-cloud;
Across the hollow and along the hill
It whips and whirls among the maples, till
With boughs upbent, and green of leaves blown wide,
The silver shines upon their underside.
A gusty freshening of humid air,
With showers laden, and with fragrance rare;
And now a little sprinkle, with a dash
Of great cool drops that fall with sudden splash;
Then over field and hollow, grass and grain,
The loud, crisp whiteness of the nearing rain.","From out the west, where darkling storm-clouds float, encompasses the ’waking wind pipes soft its rising note. The wind preludes with sighs its roundelay, then blowing, singing, piping, laughing loud."
Shadow River,"Muskoka
A stream of tender gladness,
Of filmy sun, and opal tinted skies;
Of warm midsummer air that lightly lies
In mystic rings,
Where softly swings
The music of a thousand wings
That almost tones to sadness.
Midway ’twixt earth and heaven,
A bubble in the pearly air, I seem
To float upon the sapphire floor, a dream
Of clouds of snow,
Above, below,
Drift with my drifting, dim and slow,
As twilight drifts to even.
The little fern-leaf, bending
Upon the brink, its green reflection greets,
And kisses soft the shadow that it meets
With touch so fine,
The border line
The keenest vision can’t define;
So perfect is the blending.
The far, fir trees that cover
The brownish hills with needles green and gold,
The arching elms o’erhead, vinegrown and old,
Repictured are
Beneath me far,
Where not a ripple moves to mar
Shades underneath, or over.
Mine is the undertone;
The beauty, strength, and power of the land
Will never stir or bend at my command;
But all the shade
Is marred or made,
If I but dip my paddle blade;
And it is mine alone.
O! pathless world of seeming!
O! pathless life of mine whose deep ideal
Is more my own than ever was the real.
For others Fame
And Love’s red flame,
And yellow gold: I only claim
The shadows and the dreaming.","Muskoka, Ontario, is a small town in the Canadian province of Ontario. It is located in the heart of the Muskoka region. Muskoka is known for its beautiful scenery."
Joe,"An etching
A meadow brown; across the yonder edge
A zigzag fence is ambling; here a wedge
Of underbush has cleft its course in twain,
Till where beyond it staggers up again;
The long, grey rails stretch in a broken line
Their ragged length of rough, split forest pine,
And in their zigzag tottering have reeled
In drunken efforts to enclose the field,
Which carries on its breast, September born,
A patch of rustling, yellow, Indian corn.
Beyond its shrivelled tassels, perched upon
The topmost rail, sits Joe, the settler’s son,
A little semi-savage boy of nine.
Now dozing in the warmth of Nature’s wine,
His face the sun has tampered with, and wrought,
By heated kisses, mischief, and has brought
Some vagrant freckles, while from here and there
A few wild locks of vagabond brown hair
Escape the old straw hat the sun looks through,
And blinks to meet his Irish eyes of blue.
Barefooted, innocent of coat or vest,
His grey checked shirt unbuttoned at his chest,
Both hardy hands within their usual nest—
His breeches pockets—so, he waits to rest
His little fingers, somewhat tired and worn,
That all day long were husking Indian corn.
His drowsy lids snap at some trivial sound,
With lazy yawns he slips towards the ground,
Then with an idle whistle lifts his load
And shambles home along the country road
That stretches on, fringed out with stumps and weeds,
And finally unto the backwoods leads,
Where forests wait with giant trunk and bough
The axe of pioneer, the settler’s plough.","Joe, the settler’s son, sits on the topmost rail, a little semi-savage boy of nine.

Moonset,"Idles the night wind through the dreaming firs,
That waking murmur low,
As some lost melody returning stirs
The love of long ago;
And through the far, cool distance, zephyr fanned.
The moon is sinking into shadow-land.
The troubled night-bird, calling plaintively,
Wanders on restless wing;
The cedars, chanting vespers to the sea,
Await its answering,
That comes in wash of waves along the strand,
The while the moon slips into shadow-land.
O! soft responsive voices of the night
I join your minstrelsy.
And call across the fading silver light
As something calls to me;
I may not all your meaning understand,
But I have touched your soul in shadow-land.","The moon is sinking into shadow-land. Idles the night wind through the dreaming firs, that waking murmur low. Some lost melody returning stirs the love of long ago."
"“And He Said, Fight On”","                     (Tennyson)
Time and its ally, Dark Disarmament,
           Have compassed me about,
Have massed their armies, and on battle bent
           My forces put to rout ;
But though I fight alone, and fall, and die,
           Talk terms of Peace?   Not I.
They war upon my fortress, and their guns
           Are shattering its walls ;
My army plays the cowards’ part, and runs,

They’ve shot my flag to ribbons, but in rents
           It floats above the height ;
Their ensign shall not crown my battlements
           While I can stand and fight.
I fling defiance at them as I cry,

Calgary of the Plains,"Not of the seething cities with their swarming human hives,
Their fetid airs, their reeking streets, their dwarfed and poisoned lives,
Not of the buried yesterdays, but of the days to be,
The glory and the gateway of the yellow West is she.

The Northern Lights dance down her plains with soft and silvery feet,
The sunrise gilds her prairies when the dawn and daylight meet ;
Along her level lands the fitful southern breezes sweep,
And beyond her western windows the sublime old mountains sleep.

The Redman haunts her portals, and the Paleface treads her streets,
The Indian’s stealthy footstep with the course of commerce meets,
And hunters whisper vaguely of the half forgotten tales
Of phantom herds of bison lurking on her midnight trails.

Not hers the lore of olden lands, their laurels and their bays ;
But what are these, compared to one of all her perfect days?
For naught can buy the jewel that upon her forehead lies––
The cloudless sapphire Heaven of her territorial skies.","The Northern Lights dance down her plains with soft and silvery feet. The sunrise gilds her prairies when the dawn and daylight meet. The Redman haunts her portals, and the Paleface treads her streets."
The Wolf,"Like a grey shadow lurking in the light,
He ventures forth along the edge of night ;
With silent foot he scouts the coulie’s rim
And scents the carrion awaiting him.
His savage eyeballs lurid with a flare
Seen but in unfed beasts which leave their lair
To wrangle with their fellows for a meal
Of bones ill-covered.   Sets he forth to steal,
To search and snarl and forage hungrily ;
A worthless prairie vagabond is he.
Luckless the settler’s heifer which astray
Falls to his fangs and violence a prey ;
Useless her blatant calling when his teeth
Are fast upon her quivering flank––beneath
His fell voracity she falls and dies
With inarticulate and piteous cries,
Unheard, unheeded in the barren waste,
To be devoured with savage greed and haste.
Up the horizon once again he prowls
And far across its desolation howls ;
Sneaking and satisfied his lair he gains
And leaves her bones to bleach upon the plains.","A worthless prairie vagabond is he. Like a grey shadow lurking in the light, he ventures forth along the edge of night. With silent foot he scouts the coulie’s rim and scents the carrion awaiting him."

Stripped to the waist, his copper-coloured skin
Red from the smouldering heat of hate within,
Lean as a wolf in winter, fierce of mood––
As all wild things that hunt for foes, or food––
War paint adorning breast and thigh and face,
Armed with the ancient weapons of his race,
A slender ashen bow, deer sinew strung,
And flint-tipped arrow each with poisoned tongue,––
Thus does the Red man stalk to death his foe,
And sighting him strings silently his bow,
Takes his unerring aim, and straight and true
The arrow cuts in flight the forest through,
A flint which never made for mark and missed,
And finds the heart of his antagonist.
Thus has he warred and won since time began,
Thus does the Indian bring to earth his man.

Ungarmented, save for a web that lies
In fleecy folds across his impish eyes,
A tiny archer takes his way intent
On mischief, which is his especial bent.
Across his shoulder lies a quiver, filled
With arrows dipped in honey, thrice distilled
From all the roses brides have ever worn
Since that first wedding out of Eden born.
Beneath a cherub face and dimpled smile
This youthful hunter hides a heart of guile ;
His arrows aimed at random fly in quest
Of lodging-place within some blameless breast.
But those he wounds die happily, and so
Blame not young Cupid with his dart and bow :

Transporting into Heaven both maid and man.",The Red Man is an Indian hunter who uses a bow and arrow to kill his enemies. He is armed with a quiver of arrows dipped in honey and poisoned with poisoned tongue.
Day Dawn,"All yesterday the thought of you was resting in my soul.
And when sleep wandered o’er the world that very thought she stole
To fill my dreams with splendour such as stars could not eclipse,
And in the morn I wakened with your name upon my lips.


Awakened, my beloved, to the morning of your eyes,
Your splendid eyes, so full of clouds, wherein a shadow tries
To overcome the flame that melts into the world of grey,
As coming suns dissolve the dark that veils the edge of day.

Cool drifts the air at dawn of day, cool lies the sleeping dew,
But all my heart is burning, for it woke from dreams of you;
And O ! these longing eyes of mine look out and only see
A dying night, a waking day, and calm on all but me.
  So gently creeps the morning through the heavy air,
The dawn grey-garbed and velvet-shod is wandering everywhere
To wake the slumber-laden hours that leave their dreamless rest,
With outspread, laggard wings to court the pillows of the west.
  Up from the earth a moisture steals with odours fresh and soft,
A smell of moss and grasses warm with dew, and far aloft
The stars are growing colourless, while drooping in the west,
A late, wan moon is paling in a sky of amethyst.

The passing of the shadows, as they waft their pinions near,
Has stirred a tender wind within the night-hushed atmosphere,
That in its homeless wanderings sobs in an undertone
An echo to my heart that sobbing calls for you alone.

The night is gone, belovéd, and another day set free,
Another day of hunger for the one I may not see.
What care I for the perfect dawn?  the blue and empty skies?
The night is always mine without the morning of your eyes.","The poem was written by French poet Frida Ghitis. Ghitis writes: ""All my heart is burning, for it woke from dreams of you"" ""The night is always mine without the morning of your eyes"""
When George was King,"Cards, and swords, and a lady’s love,

An insult veiled, a downcast glove,
And rapiers leap unheeding.
       And ’tis O! for the brawl,
       The thrust, the fall,
And the foe at your feet a-bleeding.
  Tales of revel at wayside inns,
The goblets gaily filling,
Braggarts boasting a thousand sins,
Though none can boast a shilling.
       And ’tis O ! for the wine,
       The frothing stein,
And the clamour of cups a-spilling.
  Tales of maidens in rich brocade,
Powder and puff and patches,
Gallants lilting a serenade
Of old-time trolls and catches. 
       And ’tis O ! for the lips
       And the finger tips,
And the kiss that the boldest snatches.
  Tales of buckle and big rosette,
The slender shoe adorning,
Of curtseying through the minuet
With laughter, love, or scorning.
       And ’tis O ! for the shout
       Of the roustabout,
As he hies him home in the morning.
Cards and swords, and a lady’s love,
Give to the tale God-speeding,
War and wassail, and perfumed glove,

And a life that was worth the leading.","Cards, and swords, and a lady’s love, that is a tale worth reading. Tales of revel at wayside inns, the goblets gaily filling. Braggarts boasting a thousand sins, though none can boast a shilling."

The Homing Bee,"You are belted with gold, little brother of mine,
      Yellow gold, like the sun
That spills in the west, as a chalice of wine
      When feasting is done.
You are gossamer-winged, little brother of mine,
      Tissue winged, like the mist
That broods where the marshes melt into a line
      Of vapour sun-kissed.
You are laden with sweets, little brother of mine,
      Flower sweets, like the touch
Of hands we have longed for, of arms that entwine,
      Of lips that love much.
You are better than I, little brother of mine,
      Than I, human-souled,
For you bring from the blossoms and red summer shine,

Into a filmy barricade

A vagrant band of mischiefs these,
    With wings of grey and cobweb gown;
They live along the edge of seas,
    And creeping out on foot of down,
They chase and frolic, frisk and tease
    At blind-man’s buff with all the town.
And when at eventide the sun
    Breaks with a glory through their grey,
The vapour-fairies, one by one,
Outspread their wings and float away
In clouds of colouring, that run
    Wine-like along the rim of day.
Athwart the beauty and the breast
    Of purpling airs they twirl and twist,
Then float away to some far rest,
    Leaving the skies all colour-kiss’t––
A glorious and a golden West
    That greets the Lifting of the Mist.","A vagrant band of mischiefs these, with wings of grey and cobweb gowns. They live along the edge of seas and live in clouds of colouring, that run Wine-like along the rim of day."

The Trail to Lillooet,"Sob of fall, and song of forest, come you here on haunting quest,
Calling through the seas and silence, from God’s country of the west.
Where the mountain pass is narrow, and the torrent white and strong,
Down its rocky-throated cañon, sings its golden-throated song.
You are singing there together through the God-begotten nights,
And the leaning stars are listening above the distant heights
That lift like points of opal in the crescent coronet
About whose golden setting sweeps the trail to Lillooet.
Trail that winds and trail that wanders, like a cobweb hanging high,
Just a hazy thread outlining mid-way of the stream and sky,
Where the Fraser River cañon yawns its pathway to the sea,
But half the world has shouldered up between its song and me.
Here, the placid English August, and the sea-encircled miles,
There––God’s copper-coloured sunshine beating through the lonely aisles
Where the waterfalls and forest voice for ever their duet,
And call across the cañon on the trail to Lillooet.","Songs of fall, and song of forest, come you here on haunting quest,                Calling through the seas and silence, from God’s country of the west.Where the Fraser River cañon yawns its pathway to the sea."
The Cattle Country,"Up the dusk-enfolded prairie,
   Foot-falls, soft and sly,
Velvet cushioned, wild and wary,
   Then––the coyote’s cry.
Rush of hoofs, and roar and rattle,
   Beasts of blood and breed,
Twenty thousand frightened cattle,
   Then––the wild stampede.
Pliant lasso circling wider
   In the frenzied flight––
Loping horse and cursing rider,
   Plunging through the night.
Rim of dawn the darkness losing
   Trail of blackened soil;
Perfume of the sage brush oozing
   On the air like oil.
Foothills to the Rockies lifting
   Brown, and blue, and green,
Warm Alberta sunlight drifting
   Over leagues between.
That’s the country of the ranges,
   Plain and prairie land,
And the God who never changes
   Holds it in His hand.","The book is set in Alberta, Canada, where the author grew up. The author describes the country as ""plain and prairie land, and the God who never changes changes it"""
"Lines Written at Castle Island, Lake Superior","translated from the Anishinaabemowin
Here in my native inland sea
From pain and sickness would I flee
And from its shores and island bright
Gather a store of sweet delight.
Lone island of the saltless sea!
How wide, how sweet, how fresh and free
How all transporting—is the view
Of rocks and skies and waters blue
Uniting, as a song’s sweet strains
To tell, here nature only reigns.
Ah, nature! here forever sway
Far from the haunts of men away
For here, there are no sordid fears,
No crimes, no misery, no tears
No pride of wealth; the heart to fill,
No laws to treat my people ill.","Anishinaabemowin: ""Here in my native inland sea                From pain and sickness would I flee                Gather a store of sweet delight"" ""Here nature only reigns,"" the author writes."
The Indian Corn Planter,"He needs must leave the trapping and the chase,
   For mating game his arrows ne’er despoil,
And from the hunter’s heaven turn his face,
   To wring some promise from the dormant soil.
He needs must leave the lodge that wintered him,
   The enervating fires, the blanket bed––
The women’s dulcet voices, for the grim
   Realities of laboring for bread.
So goes he forth beneath the planter’s moon
   With sack of seed that pledges large increase,
His simple pagan faith knows night and noon,
   Heat, cold, seedtime and harvest shall not cease.
And yielding to his needs, this honest sod,
   Brown as the hand that tills it, moist with rain,
Teeming with ripe fulfillment, true as God,
   With fostering richness, mothers every grain.","He needs to leave the lodge that wintered him, the enervating fires, the blanket bed, the women’s dulcet voices, for the grim grim realities of laboring for bread.

Ghazal for a First Lover,"When I first took her or she took me, sanded
and bagged me, loosened up my eyes
Sun was our planet, broken into arrows, heat along
our arms, burned, burnt, dissolving into ay’s
Mouthed weather, marsh of sheets, splintered skin
where now she buried salt, my gorgeous demise
I tried not to name what came for me, yet: elbow, kneecap,
chin hair, waves of smell grafted to cupping hands, overflowing eyes
Grew me longer than the length of me, myself gone reaching,
reaping—how, silly me, I thought I’d ever used before my eyes.","When I first took her or she took me, sanded and bagged me, loosened up my eyes. Sun was our planet, broken into arrows, heat along our arms, burned, burnt."
Evening,"From out my open window, I can see
The rolling waves, as fierce and restlessly,
They dash against the long, long stretch of shore,
And in the distance, I can dimly trace,
Some out-bound vessel having left her place
Of Harbor, to return perhaps no more.
Within my mind there dwells this lingering thought,
How oft from ill the greatest good is wrought,
Perhaps some shattered wreck along the strand,
Will help to make the fire burn more bright,
And for some weary traveller to-night,
’Twill serve the purpose of a guiding hand.
Ah yes, and thus it is with these our lives,
Some poor misshapen remnant still survives,
Of what was once a fair and beauteous form,
And yet some dwelling may be made more bright,
Some one afar may catch a gleam of light,
After the fury of the blighting storm.","From out my open window, I can see the rolling waves, as fierce and restlessly,                They dash against the long, long stretch of shore.

And watch the children, as with eager hands
They gather driftwood for the evening fire.
Their merry laughter, ringing loud and clear,
Resounds like sweetest music to my ear,
As swift they toil, each with the same desire.
And now their task completed, they depart,
Each one with beaming face and happy heart,
They too, will watch the driftwood fire to-night,
And knowing this, they hasten glad and gay,
With willing feet, along the homeward way,
Their precious burdens bearing with delight.
I watch these little children of the poor,
Till they have reached each lowly dwelling’s door,
And then, I too my footsteps homeward turn;
I fancy what a joyous sight ’twill be,
To see the children sitting in their glee,
Close by the fire and laugh to see it burn.","""I watch these little children of the poor, and then, I too my footsteps homeward turn"" ""I fancy what a joyous sight ’twill be, to see the children sitting in their glee,Close by the fire and laugh to see it burn"""

Truth Is Mortal,"Lines suggested by the tenor of a friendly interview between the author and the editor of the Chieftain in reference to the capture and incarceration of Crazy Snake, the Muskogee patriot.
“Truth crushed to earth will rise again,”
   ’Tis sometimes said. False! When it dies,
Like a tall tree felled on the plain,
   It never, never more, can rise.
Dead beauty’s buried out of sight;
   ’Tis gone beyond the eternal wave;
Another springs up into light,
   But not the one that’s in the grave.
I saw a ship once leave the shore;
   Its name was “Truth;” and on its board
It bore a thousand souls or more:
   Beneath its keel the ocean roared.
That ship went down with all its crew.
   True: other ships as proud as she,
Well built, and strong, and wholly new,
   Still ride upon that self-same sea.
But “Truth,” and all on her embarked
   Are lost in an eternal sleep,
(The fatal place itself unmarked)
   Far down in the abysmal deep.
Let fleeing Aguinaldo speak;
   And Oc̅eola from his cell;
And Sitting Bull, and Crazy Snake;
   Their story of experience tell.
There is no truth in all the earth
   But there’s a Calvary and a Cross;
We scarce have time to hail its birth,
   Ere we are called to mark its loss.
The truth that lives and laugh’s a sneak,
   That crouching licks the hand of power,
While that that’s worth the name is weak,
   And under foot dies every hour.","The Chieftain is a magazine of the Muskogee tribe of Oklahoma. It was founded by Sitting Bull, Crazy Snake, and Oc̅eola in 1858. The author is a descendant of Sitting Bull and Crazy Snake."
Waste Land,"Briar and fennel and chincapin,
    And rue and ragweed everywhere;
The field seemed sick as a soul with sin,
    Or dead of an old despair,
    Born of an ancient care.
The cricket’s cry and the locust’s whirr,
    And the note of a bird’s distress,
With the rasping sound of the grasshopper,
    Clung to the loneliness
    Like burrs to a trailing dress.
So sad the field, so waste the ground,
     So curst with an old despair,
A woodchuck’s burrow, a blind mole’s mound
     And a chipmunk’s stony lair,
     Seemed more than it could bear.
So lonely, too, so more than sad,
    So droning-lone with bees —
I wondered what more could Nature add
    To the sum of its miseries  .   .   .
    And then—I saw the trees. 
Skeletons gaunt that gnarled the place,
    Twisted and torn they rose—
The tortured bones of a perished race
    Of monsters no mortal knows,
    They started the mind’s repose.
And a man stood there, as still as moss,
    A lichen form that stared;
With an old blind hound that, at a loss,
    Forever around him fared
    With a snarling fang half bared.
I looked at the man; I saw him plain;
    Like a dead weed, gray and wan
Or a breath of dust.   I looked again—
    And man and dog were gone,
    Like wisps of the graying dawn.   .   .   .
Were they a part of the grim death there—
    Ragweed, fennel, and rue?
Or forms of the mind, an old despair,
    That there into semblance grew
    Out of the grief I knew?
 ","Briar and fennel and chincapin, and rue and ragweed everywhere;. The field seemed sick as a soul with sin, or dead of an old despair. A woodchuck's burrow, a blind mole's mound, and a chipmunk's stony lair, seemed more than it could bear."
Iris of Life,"Like tiny drops of crystal rain,
       In every life the moments fall,
To wear away with silent beat,
       The shell of selfishness o’er all.
And every act, not one too small,
       That leaps from out the heart’s pure glow,
Like ray of gold sends forth a light,
       While moments into seasons flow.
Athwart the dome, Eternity,
       To Iris grown resplendent, fly
Bright gleams from every noble deed,
       Till colors with each other vie.
’Tis glimpses of this grand rainbow,
       Where moments with good deeds unite,
That gladden many weary hearts,
       Inspiring them to seek more Light.","Every act, not one too small, That leaps from out the heart’s pure glow, like ray of gold sends forth a light. Like tiny drops of crystal rain, the moments fall, wearing away with silent beat."

Inversion,"for Major and Didi Jackson
There’s no suffering among dandelions,
in the way the corral gate swings open
or how the gears stay up late
to keep the wrists of the dead company.
And there’s no suffering in silt or the word marsh
or in the quadratic equation, which scurries
beneath the floorboards of my thought
like a mouse drunk on plum wine.
There’s no suffering in the steam backlit
and seared into the world at an early hour
with the horse as its guide. And there’s no suffering
in lag bolts or u-joints, nor in the sexed-up shadows
of grain elevators. There’s no suffering
in the verb itself—to suffer—which, in my kin’s tongue
means charged by the sight of an owl,
let loose from a barbed hook, returned
to the reservoir of the mind.
Today, I’m a chemical emulsion
that burns light onto paper, a three-cent stamp
honoring a woman whose name
is cloth spread throughout a meadow,
mortar setting up in a constant breeze.
The mountain air takes a handful of memories
from my chest, spreads them before me
like pewter figurines until I feel
like a tube of lipstick with an erotic name
or the long vowels in a wave’s trough,
all hum and echo. Friend, I’m both
a keyhole in a star and the key chained
to a young boy’s neck. I’m the thistle and its bloom,
father rack and pinion son, gravel and its dust.
And here, before you now, I’m on a measure
of consonants gnawing the green roots
from a blinded moon, where I say to hell with kings
and jeweled blood, for in this kingdom
suffering shall be, but never be invented.","There’s no suffering among dandelions, the way the corral gate swings open, or how the gears stay up late to keep the wrists of the dead company. And there’t no suffering in lag bolts or u-joints, nor in the sexed-up shadows of grain elevators."

The Battle-Field,"Once this soft turf, this rivulet’s sands,
   Were trampled by a hurrying crowd,
And fiery hearts and armed hands
   Encountered in the battle cloud.

Ah! I never shall the land forget
   How gushed the life-blood of her brave—
Gushed, warm with hope and courage yet,
   Upon the soil they fought to save.

Now all is calm, and fresh, and still,
   Alone the chirp of flitting bird,
And talk of children on the hill,
   And bell of wandering kine are heard.

No solemn host goes trailing by
   The black-mouthed gun and staggering wain;
Men start not at the battle-cry,
   Oh, be it never heard again!

Soon rested those who fought; but thou
   Who minglest in the harder strife
For truths which men receive not now
   Thy warfare only ends with life.

A friendless warfare! lingering long
   Through weary day and weary year.
A wild and many-weaponed throng
   Hang on thy front, and flank, and rear.

Yet nerve thy spirit to the proof,
   And blench not at thy chosen lot.
The timid good may stand aloof,
   The sage may frown—yet faint thou not.

Nor heed the shaft too surely cast,
   The foul and hissing bolt of scorn;
For with thy side shall dwell, at last,
   The victory of endurance born.

Truth, crushed to earth, shall rise again;
   The eternal years of God are hers;
But Error, wounded, writhes with pain,
   And dies among his worshippers.

Yea, though thou lie upon the dust,
   When they who helped thee flee in fear,
Die full of hope and manly trust,
   Like those who fell in battle here.

Another hand thy sword shall wield,
   Another hand the standard wave,
Till from the trumpet’s mouth is pealed
   The blast of triumph o’er thy grave.","Once this soft turf, this rivulet’s sands, were trampled by a hurrying crowd, and fiery hearts and armed hands Encountered in the battle cloud. But now all is calm, and fresh, and still, alone the chirp of flitting bird, and talk of children on the hill."
Porphyria’s Lover,"THE rain set early in to-night,
     The sullen wind was soon awake,
It tore the elm-tops down for spite,
     And did its worst to vex the lake:
     I listened with heart fit to break.
When glided in Porphyria; straight
     She shut the cold out and the storm,
And kneeled and made the cheerless grate
     Blaze up, and all the cottage warm;
     Which done, she rose, and from her form
Withdrew the dripping cloak and shawl,
     And laid her soiled gloves by, untied
Her hat and let the damp hair fall,
     And, last, she sat down by my side
     And called me. When no voice replied,
She put my arm about her waist,
     And made her smooth white shoulder bare,
And all her yellow hair displaced,
     And, stooping, made my cheek lie there,
     And spread, o’er all, her yellow hair,
Murmuring how she loved – she
     Too weak, for all her heart’s endeavor,
To set its struggling passion free
     From pride, and vainer ties dissever,
     And give herself to me for ever.
But passion sometimes would prevail,
     Nor could to-night’s gay feast restrain
A sudden thought of one so pale
     For love of her, and all in vain:
     So, she was come through wind and rain.
Be sure I looked up at her eyes
     Happy and proud; at last I knew
Porphyria worshipped me; surprise
     Made my heart swell, and still it grew
     While I debated what to do.
That moment she was mine, mine, fair,
     Perfectly pure and good: I found
A thing to do, and all her hair
     In one long yellow string I wound
     Three times her little throat around,
And strangled her. No pain felt she;
     I am quite sure she felt no pain.
As a shut bud that holds a bee,
     I warily oped her lids: again
     Laughed the blue eyes without a strain.
And I untightened next the tress
     About her neck; her cheek once more
Blushed bright beneath my burning kiss:
     I propped her head up as before,
     Only, this time my should bore
Her head, which droops upon it still:
     The smiling rosy little head,
So glad it has its utmost will,
     That all it scorned at once is fled,
     And I, its love, am gained instead!
Porphyria’s love: she guessed not how
     Her darling one wish would be heard.
And thus we sit together now,
     And all night long we have not stirred,
     And yet God has not said a word!","Porphyria worshipped me, and my heart swell, and still it grew. I strangled her three times her little throat around, and she felt no pain. At last I knew she was mine, mine, fair and pure."
I Was a Hero Once,"A dormant satellite in a room
with children, bouncing
atoms off the walls.
They are faceless, sweaty
and every storm-based verb.
I corral them before the television––
an antique microwave cooking
colorless cartoons.
As the constellation of them settle,
I move to the next room and see it.
The ceramic planter which held
a tittering ficus
had been kicked into slices.
This sight weakens me
into obscene prayers while
pulling shards from the black
pudding soil as if harvesting tombstones.
I caress the threads of roots,
squiggling in my fingers,
like the hand of a dying grandparent––
my heart pours itself empty
through disbelieving eyes.
And to think I was a hero once.
I followed a pack of thieves
who hid in a darkness unnamed by science,
yet I could still see them
              and felt sorry for them
as I levitated above the yard.
The stitching in my palms itched
emitting ophidian beams of flame
igniting every wet, incombustible
thing, synthesizing everything else
to greasy ash.
                         I could not be defeated.
I was so alone.
                         And look at me now:

Pawing through soil as hissing
tears drop like dead moths.

Proof,"My body has a legend, he says

and prove.           Tale of the tape.

              not meeting their expectations.
For years, white women were forbidden
from showing their navels on TV.

The Dirge,"     Old winter was gone 
In his weakness back to the mountains hoar, 
     And the spring came down
From the planet that hovers upon the shore
     Where the sea of sunlight encroaches 
On the limits of wintry night;—
 If the land, and the air, and the sea, 
     Rejoice not when spring approaches, 
  We did not rejoice in thee, 
         Ginevra! 

She is still, she is cold
     On the bridal couch, 
One step to the white deathbed, 
   And one to the bier, 
And one to the charnel—and one, oh where? 
    The dark arrow fled
    In the noon. 

Ere the sun through heaven once has rolled, 
The rats in her heart
Will have made their nest, 
And the worms be alive in her golden hair, 
While the Spirit that guides the sun, 
Sits throned in his flaming chair,
   She shall sleep. ","The poem was written in the first half of the 19th century. It is set in the time of Ginevra, a young woman who is about to marry her husband."

The Sleeper,"At midnight, in the month of June, 
I stand beneath the mystic moon. 
An opiate vapour, dewy, dim, 
Exhales from out her golden rim,
And, softly dripping, drop by drop, 
Upon the quiet mountain top, 
Steals drowsily and musically
Into the universal valley. 
The rosemary nods upon the grave;
The lily lolls upon the wave;
Wrapping the fog about its breast,
The ruin moulders into rest; 
Looking like Lethe, see! the lake
A conscious slumber seems to take, 
And would not, for the world, awake. 
All Beauty sleeps!—and lo! where lies
(Her casment open to the skies)
Irene, with her Destinles! 
Oh, lady bright! can it be right—
This window open to the night?
The wanton airs, from the tree-top,
Laughingly through the lattice drop—
The bodiless airs, a wizard rout,
Flit through thy chamber in and out,
And wave the curtain canopy
So fitfully—so fearfully—
Above the closed and fringéd lid
’Neath which thy slumb’ring soul lies hid,
That, o’er the floor and down the wall,
Like ghosts the shadows rise and fall!
Oh, lady dear, hast thou no fear?
Why and what art thou dreaming here?
Sure thou art come o’er far-off seas,
A wonder to these garden trees!
Strange is thy pallor! strange thy dress!
Strange, above all, thy length of tress,
And this all solemn silentness!
The lady sleeps! Oh, may her sleep,
Which is enduring, so be deep!
Heaven have her in its sacred keep!
This chamber changed for one more holy,
This bed for one more melancholy,
I pray to God that she may lie
Forever with unopened eye,
While the pale sheeted ghosts go by!
My love, she sleeps! Oh, may her sleep,
As it is lasting, so be deep!
Soft may the worms about her creep!
Far in the forest, dim and old,
For her may some tall vault unfold—
Some vault that oft hath flung its black
And wingéd pannels fluttering back,
Triumphant, o’er the crested palls
Of her grand family funerals—
Some sepulchre, remote, alone,
Against whose portals she hath thrown,
In childhood, many an idle stone—
Some tomb from out whose sounding door
She ne’er shall force an echo more,
Thrilling to think, poor child of sin!
It was the dead who groaned within.","At midnight, in the month of June,  I stand beneath the mystic moon. An opiate vapour, dewy, dim, Exhales from out her golden rim. The rosemary nods upon the grave; the lily lolls upon the wave. The ruin moulders into rest;  looking like Lethe, see! the lake."

Lines Written During My Second Pandemic,"after Franca Mancinelli
All water flows toward loneliness.
Loneliness is a black eye, a gleaming pit.
We have yet to split loneliness like an atom.
Loneliness arrives on a leash of scorpions.
In my skull, loneliness opens like a parachute.
It’s illegal to chain loneliness to a fence.
Flickers tunnel through loneliness to build nests.
I sprinkle a spoon of sugar over loneliness.
In some languages, loneliness is imperfect.
Antlers crown the bald head of loneliness.
Like rough trade, loneliness won’t kiss you.
Loneliness is crouched in a tree, afraid of dirt.
In the dark, loneliness ripens too quickly.
Beneath the roof of loneliness, my blood drifts.","Loneliness is a black eye, a gleaming pit. Loneliness is crouched in a tree, afraid of dirt. In the dark, loneliness ripens too quickly."
The Listeners,"‘Is there anybody there?’ said the Traveller,
   Knocking on the moonlit door;
And his horse in the silence champed the grasses
   Of the forest’s ferny floor:
And a bird flew up out of the turret,
   Above the Traveller’s head:
And he smote upon the door again a second time;
   ‘Is there anybody there?’ he said.
But no one descended to the Traveller;
   No head from the leaf-fringed sill
Leaned over and looked into his grey eyes,
   Where he stood perplexed and still.
But only a host of phantom listeners
   That dwelt in the lone house then
Stood listening in the quiet of the moonlight
   To that voice from the world of men:
Stood thronging the faint moonbeams on the dark stair,
   That goes down to the empty hall,
Hearkening in an air stirred and shaken
   By the lonely Traveller’s call.
And he felt in his heart their strangeness,
   Their stillness answering his cry,
While his horse moved, cropping the dark turf,
   ’Neath the starred and leafy sky;
For he suddenly smote on the door, even
   Louder, and lifted his head:—
‘Tell them I came, and no one answered,
   That I kept my word,’ he said.
Never the least stir made the listeners,
   Though every word he spake
Fell echoing through the shadowiness of the still house
   From the one man left awake:
Ay, they heard his foot upon the stirrup,
   And the sound of iron on stone,
And how the silence surged softly backward,
   When the plunging hoofs were gone.","‘Is there anybody there?’ said the Traveller, knocking on the moonlit door. ‘Tell them I came, and no one answered, and that I kept my word.’"
Californian (“You want to go back”),"You want to go back
where grief was perfect weather...
A long time
rain trussed the perspectives
with rope and silver. In the grove,
in the eucalyptus,
shadow bound
in shapeless sheaves : a sfumato of indigo
and graphite leaving the air
beneath the leaves a stain, as of mineral
and berries, a smear of menthol.
No birds ever—
or it seems so now—
in the forest. No sound
but a soft mathematics in the branches,
rain adding rain
to rain. No growth—
each tree’s dermis : dark blown glass and a breath
kept inside. And fastened
with twists of thin wire
to the branches, the leaves’ useless
ruined currency;
it glisters :
a mint of flattened nickels. It seems
you have come back—but
the money of your elegies is no good here,
listen : it isn’t your pennies any longer
hold his eyes closed.","Rain trussed the perspectives with rope and silver. In the grove, the eucalyptus, shadow bound in shapeless sheaves. You want to go back where grief was perfect weather..."
Californian (“It began like this”),"It began like this : a radio
midday, heat—remember?—a shriek
on the highway, and in the yard
Steller’s jays chafing over haggle, nag, their claims
a lyric tableau—pretty for the eye—how
sun for months stuck aureoles
of chrome around everything, even
your poems, omens
so no other disaster would happen.
But that there was dust—
it had not been so before in June,
grass dead at edges
where a dirt spread had begun, feral
cats interring piss into nasturtiums.
His death had become
the dropped side of a song, melody
undone by damage
exactly the feel of teeth entering
an apple’s bruise. The trellis kept
the jasmine rapt
as it collapsed in its own odor; so ardor also
trained the spine
of your weeping into a mind,
confluence of fumes and confusion. Over sills,
jambs, silt sent collusion : thistle, burr, mouse
turds, urine’s lingering funk in rooms
where to write was a widow
alone with the last broom she’d bought. Heat,
with its missing finger
and nine filed nails, tuned all afternoon
its blue note : horizon a slack string tautening
against asphalt, whose sound
was drought, marsh departed
before August began, black-outs rolled
house to house, how perfect the fraud and emergencies.
So there were two songs
sung in counterpoint
to jays, argument about belonging to
a place,—remember—
prey and prayer, one struck
the other beneath the lyric image, playing flint
to tinder until on the radio
eastern hills caught fire : extremis,
excelsis, that is
how summer, all veils
and exhalations, courted the hills. How
already the church was burning
when your soul went out to meet him, to marry
his new weather—","The summer of '08 was a time of extreme heat and drought in New York City. The city was sweltering and hot, and the air was full of dust and dust, but it had not been so before in June and July."

The Haunted House,"I seem like one
Who treads alone
    Some banquet-hall deserted,
Whose lights are fled,
Whose garlands dead,
    And all but me departed.
            —Thomas Moore, “Oft in the Stilly Night (Scotch Air)”
See’st thou yon gray gleaming hall,
Where the deep elm-shadows fall?
Voices that have left the earth
                Long ago,
Still are murmuring round its hearth,
               Soft and low:
Ever there;—yet one alone
Hath the gift to hear their tone.
Guests come thither, and depart,
Free of step, and light of heart;
Children, with sweet visions blessed,
In the haunted chambers rest;
One alone unslumbering lies
When the night hath sealed all eyes,
One quick heart and watchful ear,
Listening for those whispers clear.
See’st thou where the woodbine-flowers
O’er yon low porch hang in showers?
Startling faces of the dead,
               Pale, yet sweet,
One lone woman’s entering tread
               There still meet!
Some with young, smooth foreheads fair,
Faintly shining through bright hair;
Some with reverend locks of snow—
All, all buried long ago!
All, from under deep sea-waves,
Or the flowers of foreign graves,
Or the old and bannered aisle,
Where their high tombs gleam the while;
Rising, wandering, floating by,
Suddenly and silently,
Through their earthly home and place,
But amidst another race.
Wherefore, unto one alone,
Are those sounds and visions known?
Wherefore hath that spell of power
               Dark and dread,
On her soul, a baleful dower,
               Thus been shed?
Oh! in those deep-seeing eyes,
No strange gift of mystery lies!
She is lone where once she moved,
Fair, and happy, and beloved!
Sunny smiles were glancing round her,
Tendrils of kind hearts had bound her;
Now those silver chords are broken,
Those bright looks have left no token;
Not one trace on all the earth,
Save her memory of their mirth.
She is lone and lingering now,
Dreams have gathered o’er her brow,
Midst gay songs and children’s play,
She is dwelling far away;
Seeing what none else may see—
Haunted still her place must be!",Thomas Moore’s “Oft in the Stilly Night (Scotch Air)’ is one of the most famous songs of the 20th century. The song is about a woman who treads alone through a banquet hall.
The Price of the End of It,"But now it’s her stooped body in queue for the slab, 
her blessed temperature you’re fiddlin’ with, and God’s
holy directive shifts accordingly. Your mother holds 
the tasteful funeral home brochures an inch from her 
eyes until their horrible words unblur, shakes her head 
at the insane cost of the gilded, pall-borne tribute she truly 
craves, asks again for whatever’s cheap. May her Lord 
forgive you as you just keep shuffling that cremation info 
to the top of the pile. You remember how stupidly she 
bobs her napped head to the wagging finger of God, 
God again, always God, how resolutely she clutches 
all the bluish notes in gospel—for her, “the fire next 
time” is not a frugal means of disposing of soulless 
shells, it is payback for a life clawed together outside 
of her savior’s cold little classroom. Oh, never you mind 
the lesson she drilled into you after a handgun blasted 
your father out of the world, what she said to end your 
bouts of snot and fever, your worrisome new habits of 
snatching tufts of hair from your own head and screaming 
the onsets of dawn—Your daddy’s not in that ol’ body 
anymore— and you unrolled your eyes just in time to look 
that pliant, just in time to make her think you believed her.
Now that she has refused to the neat conclusion of ash,
you are thinking of all the damned reams of paperwork
glorious ceremony requires, the feel of scrawling your 
name over and over to officially end her. There will be too 
many syrupy, flowers draped over everywhere, the casket
lid flipped open, your oblivious mother’s vaguely 
whorish makeup job. You dread the hearse’s eerie creep 
through annoyed Ubers, the depressing pit, mourners 
sneaking cell snaps, taking note of your absence of ache. 
While this strange woman comparison-shops, zeroing in 
on the pauper’s special—Girl, what is a cloth casket?—
you remember years of screaming her name into a dead 
phone after she scrubbed her whole history of your needy 
little face. Now that she is frail and beholding, you should
demand that she answer for that kind of love. Or you
can love that way too. Go on. Throw a match into her hair.

Don’t You Wanna,"A double golden shovel
C’mon in, out of that wretched hot, out of the hammer of heat, c’mon! 
Baby, don’t you let these blistering Chi streets put the dead on you. Baby,
don’t you hear that gravel groan, all those wails of been-done-wrong, don’t
you wanna dance, just once, with your backside ’gainst the floor? Don’t you
want to know how grown folk handle heartbroke? You know the boys want
to see all your sugarbottom dripping off a piece of barstool, they want to
go a little crazy with a lotta you on the dance floor. Loose that swivel! Go!
C’mon, sidle on up to the Alabama man on the mic, give him that come-on, 
baby, make him play that brown liquor song that ain’t got no bottom— Baby,
don’t go, please don’t go, he screeches, hurt all up in his neck. Please don’t
you leave me, woman! And like a blue man do, he already knows what you 
want, how you want it. You want to suffer to the roots of your wig, you want
to break the last written rules in the pulpit of this wicked church, you want to
go wallow in the nasty and the necessary, where every way out is alley, go
back to the west side and lunches of improbable pig, you want to go back 
to being a bowlegged goddess only a kingdom like Chicago could love. To
that, and to you, we raise our jelly jars brimming with hootch. You’re that
same woman who makes men know their knees. Yeah, you’re that same
ol’ gal who pains a man so hard his voice skips like a record. Only one ol’
place got the muscle to birth a woman as woman as you. Just one place,
sweet like Nehi grape soda and sour pickle peppermints. It’s our sweet
home, roguish and royal, that wild child riding the lip of a lake. It’s home.
Chicago is sky enough for a storm like you—a storm that hisses Chicago.

What Daughters Come Down To,"For what I’m sure is the fifth time, my mother
plugs in a flat mournful hum where the words
I love you too should be. Then she hangs up 
without saying goodbye. I squeeze my eyes
shut, try to imagine 82 autumns in the bones,
in her rasping joints, in the cool, jaded thump
of what is still a migrant’s ever-arriving heart.
However, I believe she is required to love me.
I wonder what God was teaching her all those 
years, those day after days coaxing raucous 
hips into deadening girdles and gray A-lines 
so she could lose her damned mind to organ. 
Was it all theater, a screeching of north when 
south was what itched her, all of it mock belly, 
the nails, splinter-spewing cross, some sly
spirit habitually overloading her spine, making
her dance thirsty and unfolded? How could all 
those wry hymns and hot-sauced hallelujahs 
lead to this hum, clipped connect and hush?
I am hundreds of miles away, but I can see
where she is sitting, hand still on the phone.
Every surface in her tiny apartment is scoured 
and bleached, draped in a disinfectant meld 
of rainshower and blades. The kitchen glints. 
Her rugs are faultless. The purpled tulips I 
have sent for her birthday are insistent feral 
beauty, a blood in the room. Like her daughter,
they have bloomed in the clutches of vapor. 
I love you too, she thinks out loud, but can’t.","My mother hangs up on me without saying goodbye. I squeeze my eyes tightly shut, try to imagine 82 autumns in the bones. I am hundreds of miles away, but I can see where she is sitting."
The Succumbing,"For Firemen Joseph Graffagnino and Robert Beddia,
lost in the Deutsche Bank Building, NYC, August 18, 2007
  Sizzle, gallop, pushing spew of spark and angle,
fire beyond its normal rage and human border,
taunting skin. And Joseph’s cage is now collapsing,
barely, very barely, managing to hold his
thawing heart’s despairing claw, its shrinking language.
Landscape still beneath him, arms still blindly flailing,
Bobby must remember that to squelch the blazing
means to resurrect deceit, to conjure just the
sound of water on the tongue. The goddamned fools who
seek to save a wall must swallow razors, forkfuls
of a dimming light, must pray to conjure current.
Shuttered throats go craving for a gasp, a way to
scare the day aloose, to flood those shrinking roads with
fuel, whiskey—anything that flows. We’re running 
out of air. The burning riddle-spits, confounding
wind, and whittles towards the bursting bones of both our
boys. Days after, soft and sated smoke will drift like
bland religions up, till someone late for work—some 
sweating stressed New Yorker who barely snags the 6—
slams himself, panting, sideways in a seat. It’s hot 
as holy hell he spits, We’re going to die in here.","Firemen Joseph Graffagnino and Robert Beddia were killed in the Deutsche Bank Building, NYC, August 18, 2007. For more information on the memorial service, visit: www.justgiving.com/josephgrafagnino."
Ghazal of Oranges,"On New Year’s Eve, my father overfills the baskets with oranges,
mangoes, grapes, grapefruits, other citrus too, but mostly oranges.
The morning of the first, he opens every window to let the new year in.
In Chinatown, red bags sag with mustard greens and mandarin oranges.
A farmer in a fallow season kneels to know the dirt. More silt than soil,
he wipes his brow and mumbles to his dog: time to give up this crop of oranges.
The woman knows she let herself say too much to someone undeserving.
She lays her penance on her sister’s doorstep: a case of expensive oranges.
At the Whitney, I take a photo of a poem in a book behind the glass.
Above it, a painting: smears of blue, Frank O’Hara, his messy oranges.
The handsome server speaks with his hands: Tonight is grilled octopus
with braised fennel and olives, topped with peppercress, cara caras, and blood oranges.
No one at the table looks up, ashamed by the prices on the chic menus.
The busser fills my water and I inhale him: his faraway scent of oranges.
Seventh grade, Southern California: we monitored the daily smog alerts.
Red: stay inside. White: play outside. I forget what warning orange is.
Clutch was serious about art and said our final projects could be
whatever . . . performative . . . like, just show up with a wheelbarrow full of oranges.
Jan, in all of those first six years, why is all you can remember this:
the mist rising in the sunny air as you watched her peeling oranges.","On New Year’s Eve, my father overfills the baskets with oranges. The woman knows she let herself say too much to someone undeserving. The busser fills my water and I inhale him: his faraway scent of oranges."
Crazy When You Smile,"I’d never seen them up this close before
or ever known the awkward reckoning 
of our collapsing distance. Their hatred 
of what I am blooms wreckage on their skin,
their arms and faces blare in crimson while
they wave their placards with my breath
misspelled. I never thought that I would find
myself the object of foreboding thick 
enough to make a white man bare his teeth,
all Lucky Struck and rotting, just to hiss
a tightening noose in my direction, or spot 
a mother in a boxy robe of dimming flowers, 
hair all done up high and gelled, wrapped 
‘round Velcro rollers. She sidearms rocks 
at the window by my head—I refuse to flinch. 
She calls me monkey. I smile at her beyond 
and through the spidered cracking of the glass.
It really drives them crazy when you smile 
my father said this morning, while I scrubbed
my pimpled cheeks and picked my badass ‘fro 
to sky. Don’t let on that you’re mad or scared.
I can’t say that I really understood the strategy 
of being less of myself—pretending deafness, 
unremembering my fists. I know he was thinking
of those long ago students in Greensboro, stiff 
in their counter seats at Woolworth’s while 
keening white boys leered and drenched their 
heads with flour, ketchup, sugar, mustard,
spit. Perhaps there was a lesson to be learned.
But this is Boston, ten whole years from then,
and maybe I don’t want to be a martyr because 
to me it looks like nothing much has changed. 
I’m stiff in my seat on this bus while seething 
white folks scan the ground for stones, for shards 
of glass, for ways to break the skin that vexes 
them. I know that this is not the South, and yet 
it is. I know God said they know not what 
they do—but yeah, they do. I know that I am 
not a fool, and yet I feel like one. Like the coon 
they expect to see—smiling and swallowing. 
And everyone still sitting on the bus is silent—
fascinated by the spew of phlegm and venom 
smearing the windows, the way no matter how 
they sing our names it sounds like nigger—
nigger screeched so wide, so thousand times 
and so on-key. When they let me go I just might 
wear that new name home to show my father. ","The author was born and raised in Boston, Massachusetts, and now lives in New York City. She writes about growing up in the South and the racism she experienced."
Mister,"I don’t have the papers to travel to

Maybe it has time to officiate a wedding between me
and the mist that’s gathered here today.

when I oil my body in the mirror. To love it
means to love a man means an opening
to another man. When I take my glasses off
all the lines blur. A body is a body without
language, I tell my girlfriend and she laughs,
mouth wide enough to hide in. She shows me
my softest parts. I dissolve into what. I forget
hiding also means a good beating, the way
passion can be suffering. I can’t believe
my whole life I never touched what made me
holy. We have bread, butter and nowhere to be.","To love a man means an opening                to another man. A firm hand. The shadow waves of satin. He calls me baby, and I touch my face."
Overalls,"On a visit to my Amá’s, she drives us to the DMV.
She must renew her license every few months.
The asylum case has not yet been approved.
Not enough evidence that home is unsafe.
The line is long. The DMV is inside a mall.
In America, everything is for sale. Migrants
pay for safety. We pay people to believe
that what we tell them is true, especially
when we have spared them the hardest
facts to hold. Immigration, DMV, school,
and medical forms ask for our stories.
We pay for our stories too. We pay in smiles,
pretend laughs, head nods, empty stomachs,
panic attacks reserved for elevators,
migraines that will last four days but go
unnamed :: unuttered. After thirty-eight, or
forty minutes, we advance seven or so people
and the Carter’s window is visible from where
Amá and I stand. Overalls. My heart raises.
Eyes begin to shake. Mall lighting hurts
my eyes. I see five Carter’s logos and know
there is only one. I slam my back against the
glass windows. People look (and pretend they
don’t). I try to find my inhaler. It’s not in my
pockets. I close my eyes. I think about a boy.
Kissing a boy. I think about him more. I open
my eyes and look for my mother. Avoid looking
at the Carter’s again. The DMV does not
renew the license. Something about an error
or a glitch :: a document and migration :: (maybe)
a mother and a child. At five, I wore a pair of
overalls. Crossed a border in them too.","In America, everything is for sale. Migrants pay for safety. Immigration, DMV, school, medical forms ask for our stories. We pay in smiles, empty stomachs,panic attacks reserved for elevators."
Lake of the Isles,"January 2021
After my grandfather died
I waited for him to arrive
In Minneapolis. Daily
I walked across the water
Wearing my black armband
Sewn from scraps, ears trained for his voice.
Migration teaches death, deprives us
Of the language of the body,
Prepares us for other kinds of crossings,
The endless innovations of grief.
Forty-nine days, forty-nine nights—
I carried his name and a stick
Of incense to the island in the lake
And with fellow mourners watched
As it burned a hole in the ice.
He did not give a sign, but I imagined him
Traveling against the grain
Of the earth, declining time.
Spirit like wind, roughening
Whatever of ourselves we leave bare.
When he was alive, he and I
Rarely spoke. But his was a great
And courageous tenderness.
Now we are beyond the barriers
Of embodied speech, of nationhood.
Someday, I will join him there in the country
Of our collective future, knowing
That loneliness is just an ongoing
Relationship with time.
It is such a strange thing, to be
Continuous. In the weeks without snow,
What do the small creatures drink?","After my grandfather died, I walked across the water wearing my black armband. He did not give a sign, but I imagined him traveling against the grain of the earth, declining time."

To Dinah Washington,"I have heard your voice floating, royal and real,
Across the dusky neighborhoods,
And the eyes of old men grow bright, remembering;
Children stop their play to listen,
Remembering—though they have never heard you before,
You are familiar to them:
Queen of the Blues, singing an eternal song.
In the scarred booths of Forty-Third street,
“Long Johns” suck in their bellies,
On the brass studded leather of Elite-town,
Silk-suited Bucks raise their chins…
Wherever a man is without a warm woman,
Or a woman without her muscled man,

The Swallow,"Little lone swallow frequenting the skies in the bleakness of oncoming rain,
Gloating on the view by the river reflected when days of sun reappear,
You who can sing in the fulness of sorrow, and in seasons of gladness usefully sing,
You who in mirth and melancholy alike find joy, joy in you we find.
We who aspire to vistas beyond us and only can lift our eyes,
We who live in transient gladness and hovering gloom,
We of the earth who cannot fly with you.
What life is yours who pursue not pleasure and yet have it,
You who know sorrow and by it be left unoppressed
You who in shadow arise, and in sunshine pensively dream on the river,
Of gladness not taking nor little nor much,
Of sorrow the master more often than not,
Knowing the one and the other as passing, imperfect,
Passing as the clouds in the bleakness of oncoming rain,
Imperfect as the vista by the river reflected when days of sun reappear.","Little lone swallow frequenting the skies in the bleakness of oncoming rain. Gloating on the view by the river reflected when days of sun reappear. Knowing the one and the other as passing, imperfect."
Manila Bay,"I sit upon the white rocks by the bay,
Against whose hollows numberless, the waves
Will splash forevermore. The sunset laves
The deep with light. There rise far away
A mountain that has seemingly defied
The very clouds unchanged. And near, portending
That all created things will have an ending,
These crumbled crags lie by the ocean side!
O time! what element escapes your slow
And causeless move? These rough, resisting rocks,
Which the wind startled wave incessant mocks,
Are not to it unyielding even now.

And so must all, whatever may be seeming.","""I sit upon the white rocks by the bay, against whose hollows numberless, the waves will splash forevermore"" ""The day is done, for once it had a beaming, bright end, and so must all, whatever may be seeming"""
Intramuros,"Out where the wild vines spread
Upon the winding walls,
I hear melodious madrigals
And music from the dead.
There where the grasses hang
Their canopy of leaves,
Which oft at dawn receives
Matins the mayas sang,
Where peace holds solemn sway
On mounted mossy squares,
Where panting thoroughfares
Are heard, but far away...
There will I sit and sing,
Far from the tramp of feet
Upon the crowded street,
And dream of crown and king.
Old walls now mouldering
In quiet, silent ease,
They knew not then of peace
When glory was their king.
They tell of a long-lost reign
And love-forsaken beauty,
Of sentinels on duty
With musket and with wine!
Of war and wrathful fight,
Of surging mob and crowd,
Protesting clear and loud
Against the law of might.
Of pirate Limahongs
That raided towns and coasts,
While vengeful hordes and hosts
Were shouting war-time songs.
Of sailors bold and brave,
Of buccaneer Van Noort,
Morga, who sailed from port,
The Spanish flag to save.
And of the years before,
When king was Soliman,
Whose rajah blood outran
To free his native shore.
Here once they help parade
Of saints and flaming torches,
Where now are crumbled churches
And convents all decayed!
Ah, walls that totter must,
Walls of pride and of power,
Living their day and hour,
Only to go to dust!
Walls, olden, ancient walls,
How many memories
And dismal harmonies
To mind your presence calls.","Old walls now mouldering, tell of a long-lost reign, when glory was their king. Out where the wild vines spread, I hear melodious madrigals and music from the dead."
Among the Hills,"I used to watch the sunrise glow
That set aflame the eastern skies,
My lips in songs did freely flow
As thoughts went fleeting with my sighs.
I’ve lived through storms and smiles and tears,
And seen familiar faces die,
Ah, these, my weary youthful years
Are fraught with shades of dreams gone by.
And yet when once again I see
The glory of the purpling hills,
My dying heart revives to be
A spring of loves and lover’s thrills.
My mind in youth did ever roam
Across the mountains and the dales,
And now my heart has found a home
Among the eastern hills and vales.","""My dying heart revives to be a spring of loves and lover's thrills"" ""My mind in youth did ever roamAcross the mountains and the dales"" ""Now my heart has found a home among the eastern hills and vales"""
Love,"In life there is no pleasure
To love and youth unknown,
For love is life’s one treasure,
And love and life are one.
In youth there is one sorrow
To love and life well known,
For beauty fades to-morrow
When youth from love has flown.
But love is like the shower
That waters gardens dry,
And brings to earth a flower
That blooms, but cannot die.","Love is life’s one treasure,                And love and life are one. In life there is no pleasure                To love and youth unknown,                For love is life's one treasure."
My Home,"Up by a leaping stream,
And cradled ’neath the hills,
The hallowed moments seem
Eternities of thrills.
The river runs its course
Half round my little nest,
Where birds are never hoarse
Singing in play and rest.
O’er the roof the cadenas creep,
Soft grasses clothe the lawn,
Which with the twilight weep
And pray for a new dawn.
At morn the butterflies
Are early on the wing,
And when the evening dies,
I hear the late bird sing.
There joy no sorrows mar,
Its cup is empty never,
Wherein griefs, falling, are
Lost in the depths forever.",The poem was written in the early hours of the morning. It is set in a small village in the north-west of England. The author describes the village as 'cradled 'neath the hills'
Awakening,"’T is time this heart indifferent
     To love so long,
Should rise from slumber impotent,
     And stroll among
The gardens that are heaven sent.
The butterflies’ unholy quest
     From vase to pot
For wine within the petal’s nest,
     Will guide me not
As it profanely guides the rest.
But it is time this heart so long
     Indifferent
For years and years, should stroll along
     Where Cupid went
One day, and listened to his song.","‘It is time this heart so long, should stroll among the gardens that are heaven sent’ ‘The butterflies’’ will guide me not as it profanely guides the rest of us."
An Invite to Eternity,"                            1
Wilt thou go with me sweet maid
Say maiden wilt thou go with me
Through the valley-depths of shade,
Of night and dark obscurity,
Where the path has lost its way
Where the sun forgets the day
Where there’s nor life nor light to see
Sweet maiden, wilt thou go with me?
                            2
Where stones will turn to flooding streams
Where plains will rise like ocean waves
Where life will fade like visioned dreams
And mountains darken into caves

Where parents live and are forgot
And sisters live and know us not?

Say maiden wilt thou go with me
In this strange death of life to be
To live in death and be the same

Things pass like shadows—and the sky
Above, below, around us lie?

The land of shadows wilt thou trace
And look—nor know each other’s face,

And past, and present all as one.

To join the living to the dead?

Maria Clara,"A rose and a lily she was, 
pure yet passionate for the love that she bore. 

Futile to her were the wiles of hypocrisy,
Harmless the proffers of dons from Spain. 

For she thought and thought only of him who was pilgrim
To the holiest holy land, 
A crusader at the gates of his sanctuary pausing, praying, 
Unable to enter there. 

In her the meek and the suffering found the heart
Of a woman to works of love devote, 
Ibarra, the gloomy, the fiery, the tempter of fate, 
Could see in her face a glimpse of tranquil peace.

That night, when alone with him whom she loved, 
She communed in fevered, intoxicant bliss, 
That night when he left her alone, 
He to be hunted to death. . . 
Her arms uplifted were protest, remonstrance
From the triumph of greed and desire. ","""A rose and a lily she was, pure yet passionate for the love that she bore"" ""Futile to her were the wiles of hypocrisy,                Harmless the proffers of dons from Spain"""
Solitude,"Stars of the sky come out on the earth, 
Out of the void of the sky, 
Out of the clouds, 
Of the mantle-clouds of the sky, 
Come, 
Come for the moon is pale. 
Pallid and spectral
As the night, 
Dead as the clouds of the night. 
Wake from the woodland, winds, 
Wanton and wail on the sea, 
Move where the billows, rent and restless, 
Are mute. 
Rise from the clod and sea and air, 
Arise, O forms that are lifeless, inert, 
Start as by impulse
And tremble to being. 
Now the light of the stars and the spheres, 
Now the breath of the wind
And the rush of the watery waste, 
Are motionless, 
Immobile, 
Dead. 
Only the tumult, 
The fire and the flame in the heart are here
Within, the beat and the pulse
Of long agitations
Perturb. 
Longings for the loved ones lost, 
Loved as the waves of the wind, 
Loved as the stars of the night, 
Lost as the wind and the night, 
Lost as the waves and the spheres. 
Without, 
In the cold, lightless silence of night. 
All is mute, 
All is dead. ",The poem was written in the early hours of the morning. It is set against a backdrop of the night sky and the waves of the sea. The poem is called 'The Stars of the sky'
The Fisherman,"A fisherman wades, knee-deep in the water, 
Feeling the stones at the bottom with his feet and his fork, 
Lighting his way with an oil-fed torch of bamboo. 
And the curtain of darkness behind him, 
And the halo of light before him,
Wrap the homely-looking man and his four-pointed fork
In chimeras of unreality. 
Ringing faintly comes the song of a siren
From under the rocks where he walks. 
And the fisherman seems like the siren endowed
With the mirthless melody of waves,
Though a sound he makes not, nor speaks in the silence. 
A merman he seems, bewailing his lost and his children
At midnight (and midnight it was when he went to the shore). 
And the fork in his hand
Looks like the scepter of the king of the sea. . . .
A king, bereft of his children, 
A ruler deserted by the queen of the sea. ","A fisherman wades, knee-deep in the water,                 Lighting his way with an oil-fed torch of bamboo. The curtain of darkness behind him, and the halo of light before him,                Wrap the homely-looking man and his four-pointed fork."
A Coast-Nightmare,"I have a friend in ghostland—
   Early found, ah me, how early lost!—
Blood-red seaweeds drip along that coastland
   By the strong sea wrenched and tossed.
In every creek there slopes a dead man’s islet,
   And such an one in every bay;
All unripened in the unended twilight:
   For there comes neither night nor day.
Unripe harvest there hath none to reap it
   From the watery misty place;
Unripe vineyard there hath none to keep it
   In unprofitable space.
Living flocks and herds are nowhere found there;
   Only ghosts in flocks and shoals:
Indistinguished hazy ghosts surround there
   Meteors whirling on their poles;
Indistinguished hazy ghosts abound there;
   Troops, yea swarms, of dead men’s souls.—
Have they towns to live in?—
   They have towers and towns from sea to sea;
Of each town the gates are seven;
   Of one of these each ghost is free.
Civilians, soldiers, seamen,
   Of one town each ghost is free:
They are ghastly men those ghostly freemen:
   Such a sight may you not see.—
How know you that your lover
   Of death’s tideless waters stoops to drink?—
Me by night doth mouldy darkness cover,
   It makes me quake to think:
All night long I feel his presence hover
   Thro’ the darkness black as ink.
Without a voice he tells me
   The wordless secrets of death’s deep:
If I sleep, his trumpet voice compels me
   To stalk forth in my sleep:
If I wake, he hunts me like a nightmare;
   I feel my hair stand up, my body creep:
Without light I see a blasting sight there,
   See a secret I must keep.","""I have a friend in ghostland,"" says the author. ""Without light I see a blasting sight there, without light I can't see it"""
Altered,"He left for Manila one day in April. 

Said good-by to the principal street in town, 
To the tall, austere cathedral beside it. 

At home the evening before, 
His mother and he a seedling in the back-yard planted. 

He stayed in the city seven years and came back in April. 

He strolled in the town as he often had 
With friends in his youth, years ago. 

Calle Real was an alley at the brook commencing, 
Ending, parted in three at the rice-fields. 
By the alley a chapel stood. 

The seedling he sowed, his mother beside him, 
So tiny then when he left for Manila, 
To a flowering tree had grown. 

And the tree by the others called sampaga for seven years,

And his mother kissed him, calling him love. ","He left for Manila one day in April. Said good-by to the principal street in town,                 To the tall, austere cathedral beside it. He stayed in the city seven years and came back in April, he says."
Unsophistication,"The stir of business relapses to silence
With the slowly sinking sun. 
The revels of pleasure commence for the weary. 

But children peering in the deepening dusk
From playmates and playthings the livelong day, 
Children in tiny, toy-houses know not
What night always brings to older, wiser men. 

At the hills where the tremulous shafts of light are flung
On a sea and a sky of gold, 
Children throw a look, careless, 
Transient as the beauty they see not, 
As the sight they cannot enjoy, nor in losing regret,
Like men sophisticated. 

Children at twilight cease from their labor and frolic, 
Impatient of morning. 
From prodigal play, ungetting, 
They sleep ungiven to the pleasure and fancy
Of older, wiser men. ","Children in tiny, toy-houses know not what night always brings to older, wiser men. The stir of business relapses to silence with the slowly sinking sun."
Sonnet [Whyfore must minstrels unattended sing],"Whyfore must minstrels unattended sing
And utter sounds by no one understood?
The shy doves coo their music to the wood
And wild—as soon responsive echoes sing:
Perfuméd flowers impetuously will fling
Such exhalations like to harmony;
The moaning waves, the blood-red clouds on high,
In our soul’s sympathy are wantoning;
But these the poets offer from their art,
Are whispers wafted from some alien strain.
Perhaps they rise as secrets of the heart,
That, surging, sink, and, sinking, surge again,
Perhaps the accents geniuses impart,
Aroused by godly impulse, heard in vain.","The poet's words are said to have been ""aroused by godly impulse, heard in vain"" The poem was written in the early 20th century."
Suspense,"At Mount Mariveles, twilight lazily lingers, 
And the sun descending, almost out of sight, 
Into the hills and the seas beyond the hills, 
Goes down hesitating, slowly, 
While the night of music and mystery waits, 
And the evening of colored lights wonders and waits
As lingers the indolent, twilight sun. 

And the little Luneta is filled to capacity. 
Crowds go there by habit as now they have gone
On this long Christmas eve. 
And the restless people, 
The band men who play to the people there, 
And the new repertoire at the stands prepared, 
Impatiently await the sun sinking slowly
Behind Mariveles miles distant. 

A boy-lover at a gate strains his ear for the six-o‘clock bell, 
At the churchyard another is reckoning time, 
Looking at the minute-hand, 
Grasping the rope to the belfry and bells. 
Children at play stand in the glimmering dusk, 
Doubting if the sun had set
Or if the mother from the window had called to supper and sleep. 

At the concert men look at their watches, 
Women turn sideways for friends and faces familiar, 
And the gallants forget to smoke 
And the flirts to flutter their fans, 
And all glance at the red, full-orbéd sun in the west, 
Loitering, lingering lazily in Bataan, 
While people to the west, leagues and leagues away, 
Stir from bed and peep from lattices and chinks in the walls, 
Watchful of dawn. ","At Mount Mariveles, twilight lazily lingers. The sun descending, almost out of sight, into the hills and the seas beyond the hills."

Sands on the shoreline,
Crags from their setting torn to pieces,
By splash and spray . . . .

For utterance suspiring. O the brave
Unnumbered dead that slumber in their fold!
Some day a bark of light will Hereward glide.

Argonauts,"From Asia’s teeming highlands, coasts and bays,

The seas below, aloft the flaming skies,
They found the ocean haven of Malays.
They set their eyes on points unvisited,

The yawning reefs kept tally of the dead,
Transforming into graves the homes they sought.
From Asia’s naked shores by fancy led,

Tears,"She felt alone
In that garden unfrequented,
Where the winds make moan
For blossom sweetly scented,
Perfumed but far away.
And as the sunset died,
Lost the last long twilight ray,
She felt so lone and cried.
Her face protesting revealed
The trace of promises and prayers unreturned,
Deep disillusions learned,
Sorrows silence-sealed.
And as she wept
Like a lost child
When the shadow of twilight crept
On the forest wild,
Not knowing the ground,
As tears and tear-drops falling,
Moistened the cheek of the night around,
I called, she heard me calling,
And longer cried in that garden frequented only
By her spirit loving and lovely.","She felt alone in that garden unfrequented, where the winds make moan. For blossom sweetly scented,                Perfumed but far away. She felt so lone and cried."
Lost Glimpses,"A fairy came out of the woods,
A creature bewitchingly fair;
A dress would have stolen the beauty
Half-hid by the locks of her hair.
She said that not far from the wilds,
Where the rill gives itself to the brook,
She had seen what for years I was searching
In cavern and crevice and nook.
She led me the way to a spring,
Where to drink meant awakening love;
A draught of the cool, magic waters
Brought pleasure untasted above.
Expectant, I closed on her steps,
We came to the brook and the rill,
But the spring was not there nor elsewhere,
And the woodland was silent and still.
Then sternly, not looking, I asked,
“Where, O fairy, is that which I seek?”
There was nothing but silence for answer,
No fairy was there then to speak.","A fairy came out of the woods, a creature bewitchingly fair. She said that not far from the wilds, where the rill gives itself to the brook, had seen what for years I was searching."
Sonnet [Our days in swift succession bid us on],"Our days in swift succession bid us on

When tired and spent we reach our destined way.
We only know that with each onward move,
We leave behind us friends we cherished most,
Old friends, who, unsustained, their path have lost,

To stranger lands, only to dead men known.","We know that time relentless bids us on to stranger lands, only to dead men known. We leave behind us friends we cherished most, who, unsustained, their path have lost, warm hearts that, hoping, beat for those they love."
Mirage,"I saw in dreams a landscape
With not a shadow by,
It seemed so like a promise
Half-hidden in the sky.
There were high hills and mountains
In purple drest and green,
Like shades and shapes fantastic
Only in dreaming seen.
The waters clear and limpid
Had but a speck to mar,
For in the depths was mirrored
The image of a Star.
Only but once there hovered
Indistinct forms and lone,
Calling to mind the faces
I knew in days by-gone.
I seemed to see them falter
As they were lost to view,
They paused and fell to doubting
Which pathway to pursue.
To them faint words were given,
I thought I heard them say,
We know not where to wander,
But cannot choose to stay.
“Over the realms of heaven
We silently must rove,
With but the Star to guide us
Back to the friends we love.”
Ah, fleeting are the fancies,
Deceiving us too well,
Nor sage nor saint can fathom
The mysteries they tell.","In dreams I saw in dreams a landscape                With not a shadow by,                It seemed so like a promise                Half-hidden in the sky.                There were high hills and mountains                In purple drest and green,                Like shades and shapes fantastic only in dreaming seen.                In the depths was mirrored the image of a Star."
Singing Funeral,"I’ve avoided opening my throat in fear the dead would rise, walk out of me, leave me emptier after their fleeting, and still get deported back into the abyss they climbed from. I don’t think they hunger me. They want to abandon and find a soft rock to lay their head on, a voice, an empty water jug, a song, the striking pain of a windless and deserted desert or a revolver or drugs or gang affiliations. Instead I hoax them to sit perched, their black wings all slick and crow-like while I drag the weight of Mexican unsung mourning in choir. Now I have someone to blame. My brother isn’t coming back from the dead and I won’t fix my scale. The tone will always be off, a crooked meteor slicing what’s left of the sky. Songs will remain unsung, the diaphragm, a cheap staircase, not even lullabies can squeeze out, my voice box sealed, a better state line than the Mexican-American border. This time mami won’t become one million doves in the driver seat while she sings to Jenni Rivera as we drive through the sandstorm. Instead she hardens, tells me of the desert roses tumbling across the desert, how just like us they have razor sharp petals as armor on their body from tumbling aimlessly for years. Memory still doesn’t strike a guitar string, the tíos are turning in their grave, while abuelita twists her mouth so we don’t see her teethless. We all have this disease, a black dove chewing on its feathers inside of a country inside us, trapped in the cave of us, we rage or corridos Chihuahuenses or a dying ensemble, but even if the song kills me I won’t set it free. It’s obvious I must avoid the eulogy that comes after talking about my brother’s death because it’ll haunt me, his death, it will follow me and take me too, and I want to sleep tonight.","I’ve avoided opening my throat in fear the dead would rise, walk out of me, leave me emptier after their fleeting, and still get deported back into the abyss they climbed from.

Mother,"When evenings cast pale shadows on the earth,
And silence, like a vast mysterious ghost,
Stifles the land and sea from hill to coast,
And buries all that tropic suns gave birth,
When by myself I pace the darkened shore,
And think of this unhappy lot of mine,
The pain and grief the fates to me assign,
I sigh for you, O mother I adore!
That I could seek your bosom as of old,
And, nestling there, bare secrets that oppress,
Accuse these that my love would disposses,
Whose hearts to cold desires and base are sold!
O mother dear! When death relieves our sighs,
Shall we in heaven, meet, in Paradise?","When evenings cast pale shadows on the earth,774And silence, like a vast mysterious ghost,774Stifles the land and sea from hill to coast.774And buries all that tropic suns gave birth,774When by myself I pace the darkened shore,774Think of this unhappy lot of mine,774The pain and grief the fates to me assign,774I sigh for you, O mother I adore!"
Parting,"Upon a path we lingered
When skies were overcast,
She knew not I was doubting
If love had come at last.
In her I felt arising
The pity Christ thought of––
To me naught else did matter
If only she could love.
To me unkind was pity,
And hurting, gratitude,
My love was more than kindness,
For thanks from her too good.
She said in lasting friendship
How happy we could be––
She did not know her hatred
Less painful were to me.
I said if love she could not,
’T were better to forget,
That in the flush of summer,
Upon that lane we met.","In the flush of summer, we met. Upon a path we lingered. When skies were overcast, she knew not I was doubting. I felt arising the pity Christ thought of."
Delirium,"In this state of the mind when the least sound perplexes,
And the faintest light shadow the spirit depresses,
When the pen, hesitating, conjectures and guesses
On the scheme enigmatic of mortals and sexes;
When the twilight with shadow the bosom but vexes,
And the morning with sunlight the temper oppresses,
When society of men a mere boredom expresses,
And the phantom of silence, a war of complexes:
Then I think of the second new life of hereafter,
Which will claim at a call my lone soul from the earth,
Of the day when I cease from all tear-drops and laughter,
When the born things are dead, and the dead given birth.
From my bed of repose I, recalling, would waft her
The one halcyon remembrance of our passionate mirth.","The writer describes a state of mind when the least sound perplexes, when the faintest light shadow the spirit depresses. He also writes of the second new life of hereafter, which will claim his soul from the earth."
Ennui,"I slept in the frenzy
And delirium of men and their cities.
Close by the streets and the cross-ways of traffic,
Deep in the waste of houses
Where multitudes unsmiling are homeless,
Mouldered the hut of my life, care-deserted,
Of a haven of slumber and open-eyed sleep,
Of peace for my soul.
To the world and its whirling of men in disorder,
To the riot of manifold unvaried activities
From the pain of birth to the pleasure of death.
I lived not,
I slept for the peace of my soul.
Ears I had but I heard not
The clamor of bells from churches and towers of stone,
I heard not the clink of metal,
The groaning of iron
With the weight of passengers and wheels of iron,
The whistle from long-throated chimneys,
The siren of sound and smoke from the piers.
To the clanking of steel,
To the hissing of vapor from pent-up boilers
In the shops on the street, in the ships on the stream,
To the thud of machines against factory walls,
And of trucks on the adamant road in the open,
To the motley news-boys shrieking,
And the rabble of crowds on the street, on the square,
In a rush of commotion and fury
To the sounds, discordant, erratic, out of tune,
Cadenceless, out of time,
I was rock, unresponsive, alien, remote,
They were silence
And echoes sepulchral of silence in tombs.
Life that stirred from the vitals of creatures
Howling and wakeful in graves . . . .
Death that returned with the ebb and recession
Of life-refusing love
These to me meant nothing, when confusion was all they could mean.
Love that was hatred merely,
Hatred begotten of love unrequited,
Pity self-seeking, self-centered, selfish,
Friendship of hearts that were hollow of feeling,
Passions let loose
And cravings run wild,
These were the forces of fire and power titanic
Oppressing the flesh of a spirit rebellious
For freedom of pleasure,
For freedom from pain.
I slept forgetful of self,
Unconcerned about others living for their own
In a half-mad world.
Of desire unmindful,
Forgetting care and canker and chaos,
I slept with Endymion, loved of the moon, perpetual,
In the wilderness of cities,
In the wasteland of war.","I slept in the frenzy and delirium of men and their cities. I heard not the clink of metal, the groaning of iron, the whistle from long-throated chimneys. I was rock, unresponsive, alien, remote, they were silence."
Sonnet [This day when waking from pertubéd sleep],"This day when waking from pertubéd sleep,
I see the dim night die upon the dawn,
And gaze on gleaming hill and dewy lawn,
On sunbeams soft that o’er the valley peep;
When Nature seems with ecstasy to weep
At seeing earth and sky so lovely grown,
And innocently to herself alone
Counts and recounts the flowers and clouds they keep,
How clearly do I see through thin green leaves
The truth that only beauteous dawns arouse;
The smallness of the mortal man who grieves,
Whose eyes to loveliness perpetual drowse.
O blesséd morning! how the long dead heaves
To life, suspiring on the blossoming boughs.","This day when waking from pertubéd sleep,urousI see the dim night die upon the dawn,                And gaze on gleaming hill and dewy lawn,                On sunbeams soft that o’er the valley peep."
Five American Sentences,"To prove to an unseen someone, a future self, that I am enough.
A loved one drowning, just out of hands’ reach; hover your hand above a flame.

The Garden of Earthly Delights,"  He is imminent, they have told us, a softer way of saying
he is about to die, like the words passed away, passed
to a place that is far, not here, cannot or will not
say where. Passed, as if through a threshold, to a place
we cannot follow, unknown to us. He died. It has a thud
to it, a spade of soil, the two d’s standing at either side
like bookends, died, bracing the solitary i, the self & the e,
his initial. His signature, a perfect birdswoop of wings.
           And taking him by the hand, he flexes his fingers in his sleep,
as if strumming guitar strings, notes that resound
in the caves of Sacromonte, geraniums in clay pots.
A puzzle on the table, half completed, all that blue & green,
grass & sky, tiny naked bodies, towers of fleshy fruits, a carousel
of dancing animals, & from somewhere comes
the music of a guitar, notes played by an unseen hand.
The adagio echoes in that whitewashed cave as we watch him pass.","He is imminent, they have told us, a softer way of saying                he is about to die, like the words passed away.

Relinquenda,"The snake always slips into the bushes when I start down the path.
The snake is just the tail end of what’s happening.
The snake doesn’t look back.
The snake is not an animal I identify with.
I mean, it’s a garden-variety queen snake but I’d still lop off its head with a machete.
Isn’t it expected that one thing will chase another?
Isn’t it normal to want your space?
About this snake, it’s not the kind that holds its tail in its mouth.
About this machete, I do not own one.
About this path, I chose it.
It’s narrow.
About this metaphor, it stretches out like a tightrope.
And these lines force one foot in front of the other.
And these steps are the ones I have to take.
About the snake, I must circle back.
About the time I left the door open.
About the zero surprise I felt when our eyes locked.
As if what I needed was a mirror.
As though I would always lead her in & back her into a corner.
As soon as I extend my hands, she coils into her self.
As soon as I take another step, she slashes the cord.","The snake is not an animal I identify with but I’d still lop off its head with a machete. The snake always slips into the bushes when I start down the path. The path, I chose it."
The Moon,"I, too, am tired of it. And yet, like an old love,
it comes to us, illuminating the bare walls
of our houses, catching its hems
on our thresholds, carrying its little cup of blossoms.
We are done with it.
Aren’t we done with it?
We have told ourselves
only grace can change us;
we have told ourselves
the craft is not the magic;
we have told ourselves
the myths are in our hands.
And yet, Issa wrote to us, and ever.
Let us walk out through the summer grass
and be there. Let us look up through the deepest leaves
and open. Let us wait, then,
while the ancient things
are woken, because haven’t
we always been lonely,
haven’t we looked up
into the wild skies
and asked, too, to be luminous
and ruined,
and risen like this cold stone in the darkness
and changed in it as radiantly as we can?

Hymn,"Nec vitia nostra nec remedia pati possumus
                                    – Livy
  We are like strangers in the wild places. We watch
the deer swinging the intricate velvet from its antlers, never knowing
we are only as immense as what we shed in the dance.
The bride and bridegroom stand at the altar. Each thing
learned in mercy has as river in it. It holds the cargo
of a thousand crafts of fire that went down at evening.
We can neither endure our misfortunes nor face
the remedies needed to cure them. The fawns move
through the forest, and we move through the ruins of the dance.
Like Job, the mourner lays his head on the cold oak
of the table. His heart is a hundred calla lilies
under the muck of the river, opening before evening.
We think there is another shore. We stand with the new life
like a mooring rope across our shoulders, never guessing
that the staying is the freightage of the dance.
Orpheus turned to see his Eurydice gone. The Furies tore him
into pieces. The sun, he said, I will worship the sun.
But something in his ruin cried out for evening, evening, evening.
The wrens build at dusk. Friends, I love their moss-dressed
nests twisting in the pitch of the rafters, for they have taught me
that the ruins of the dance are the dance.

Traffic,"Shouting in the sky-walled air.
The rig-driver’s voice is husky and his throat is hoarse with yelling and shouting in the sky-cooped air.
He jerks the flesh-cutting reins and he dangles the sharp, blood-dripping lash.
The horse is hungry.
The legs are not sure of their footing as the animal heavily gasps for breath,
Its blood kept warm by the cutting reins and whistling lash of the master with the harsh, angry voice,
Its legs propelled by the smell of sweat and blood and distant bundles of grass,
By the ceaseless urge of the creaking of the wheels behind,
By the patter of hoofs on the pavement and the hollow, unmusical echoes.
The animal thinks of the sharp-toned man of the reins and the lash that cuts as sharply,
Of the unbreathing monsters of steel that brush past him without effort,
Of the frail-footed men whom his master slavishly obeys and the round, silver pieces that pass from hand to hand,
Of the bundled zacate that he smells in the distance.
The rig-man’s musings are far from his laboring horse.
He thinks of his waiting wife and counts in his mind the fare he will empty on her lap.
He thinks of the swift-coursing car which riders prefere to his clumsy, creaking, two wheeled rig.
He swings the lash to dispel thoughts of baffled, defeated toil,
And to quicken his slackening horse.
In the rig, a young man stares at the vacant space beside him which in former days was not so.
And again he sees twin stars luminous in the darkness,
Pretty red lips parted with the laughter and wine of kisses stolen, yielded kisses and kisses unasked,
A warm, soft body pressed close against his own,
The perfume of her that sent the blood running in savage tumult through his veins.
Creaking wheels,
Patter of hoofs on the pavement,
Echoes,
Whistling and kissing of reins and the lash,
The young man’s dreams are brushed cruelly aside.
And he sends a sigh to the sky-walled air at the grim, heartless world of fact.",The rig-driver’s voice is husky and his throat is hoarse with yelling and shouting in the sky-cooped air. The animal thinks of the sharp-toned man of the reins and the lash that cuts as sharply.
Repentance,"I have flown over flowers of perfume,
Fondled and touched them before,
I have kissed them so often
And hotly,
That their lips seemed unmeaning to mine.
I am haunted by a meaning of petals
Hovering in vain
In the mind,
I am startled by a new significance
The petals convey with their eyes.
I am frightened by a thought that their color
Of purple and white provokes.
I see a red flower,
I smell a white rose,
I pluck them not
By my eyes from the sight of these!
I falter to look into them
And fail to touch them now.
Ah! these eyes and hands that have often
With a gaze, a caress profane, polluted the pure!
What lips are these to speak of flowers,
O! what lips, what lips are these!
Listless lips
Cursed with kisses in moments unholy
Of shame!
I must leave these flowers of morning.
I must leave unprofaned
These petals consecrated
To mothers on earth,
To mothers in heaven.
From purposed forgetfulness
I peep on a dawn of flowers which I
Must not see.
I will sleep to forget them again
As I have forgotten before.","I am haunted by a meaning of petalsHovering in vain in the mind. I am startled by a new significance the petals convey with their eyes. I have kissed them so often and hotly, that their lips seemed unmeaning to mine."
Pagan Passion,"I am sweetly perplexed by love sallies, releases,
By the countless retreats and the numberless captures,
By the petulant coldness and agreeable raptures,
By the whisper of phrases that hurts and then pleases,
I am drunk by the prodigal total of leases
From her body and spirit, her soul and her senses,
I revel in approaches and artless offenses,
In her challenging taunts and her tenderly teases.
Now will I disengage a red flower from her tresses,
And uplift her lithe form from a divan of roses,
For the zephyr of night too much passion opposes,
And in delicate folds now has rumpled her dresses.
On tomorrow’s new ventures the heart eager presses,
I repose now to ponder on life-soothing losses.","I am drunk by the prodigal total of leases from her body and spirit, her soul and her senses,                I revel in approaches and artless offenses,                In her challenging taunts and her tenderly teases.                I repose now to ponder on life-soothing losses."
October,"This is the season in which the lambs begin
to die, in which the boy in his red and blue plaid
shirt gets down on his wrists and his knees to crawl
into the moorland at night and spread a cross of pumice
on their foreheads, in which he reads to them a hymn
like a freighter burning with a cargo of ripened fruit
because in the morning he will have to kill them.
Because in the morning he will wake to find his father
standing in the hall like a horse with a lamp in its mouth
and he will have to wade into a river with only that silence
in his arms, and he will harm them. Because every year
I watch him stand at the threshold of a season and begin
to call them, to hold the ruined bodies of the dead
with only a dim chord of flame between his lips
and to touch them, to touch them
and to be with them, to touch them
and to sing with them, the way a child
touches everything, with the hand of his murderer.

Letter,"Tonight, as you walk out
into the stars, or the forest, or the city,
look up
as you must have looked
before love came,
before love went,
before ash was ash.
Look at them: the city’s
mists, the winters.
And the moon’s glass
you must have held once
in beginning.
That new moon
you must have touched once
in the waters,
saying change me, change
me, change me. All I want
is to be more of what I am.
 ","All I want is to be more of what I am. All I want to do is change me, change me. That new moon you must have touched once in the waters."
Mimesis,"A thinnest sliver
Of new moon light
At the horn tips of mule deer
Turned toward us
Their dark eyes don’t know
Our dry heels imitate the mountains
“Women imitate the earth”
House finches, quaking,
Imitate chambers
Like Daniel’s prints saying freedom
without love posted along the outskirts
Men wielded mirrors at men
Making of each the other’s babies
Spun ‘round
While the rest of us stayed in bed
And in our closed eyes felt the touch
Of light was a given
To use if we felt like it
As Aleppo pines thread deserts
Still silent in their roots
We will get up
In a movie about us
We’ll go to a higher desert
Only the thinnest air in our way
Released, certain accents will flare
Our mouths saying,
“Suppose one is bred an immigrant”
Citrus groves having been husbanded
Somewhere behind you
And you don’t get too precious
Like things are very small, really
They just turn over and get lost
Across several versions of the portrait
Ragged edged, the mirror, its useful mercury
Sonorous behind the glass, almost a return
Before first light assembles the blue
Then what can we tell?
We took a dialect
From a lineage they took
Only as far as the mountains
We know how to get thin and turn,
Saying, “I’m not
really interested in my affect”
However mannered,
             “Uh-huh,”

Odysseus,"Think of the moment before the moment.
Before recognition. Before the nurse saw
the boar’s scar coursing down his thigh
where the world had first entered him
in the forests of childhood. Before
Penelope. Before his battle for her heart.
Think of his moment alone on the beach,
his sailors running up to the village
where girls stood wringing spices
from their hair. Think of the gods saying to him
you do not have to praise ruin anymore;
you do not have to praise what is lost.
How you imagine him is how you enter things.
He is kneeling. Or he is weeping. Or he is turning
toward the sea again, thinking of the great deeds
of the hopeless. Think of him lifting the sands
and touching them to his tongue, to see
if it is real. If it is home. If it is time. Think of the moment
before he knew he had stepped out of the myths
and into his life. Whether that means to you
that he would sing, or mourn, or be lessened.
And his patience when he rose up again
and took himself the long way
toward his kingdom, not knowing
if it had all changed, or if love
had lasted, or if anything can last.
Think of him as though he were your life,
as though you had sat waiting at a loom
for long, dark years, weaving and unweaving
what you are. Think of your life returning to you
with eyes that had seen death. And whether
you would look away if you saw him
pausing a moment among the gardens
and the horses, listening to the song
of each thing, the common things he had forgotten.
Think of him hearing your voice again,
hiding his face in his hands
as he listened, hearing a music
of losses and joys, pestilence
and bounty, a beauty that had prepared
a place for him. And whether you would have him
be changed by that, or return
to what he was, or become
what he had come this way to become.","Think of him as though he were your life, as though you had sat waiting at a loom for long, dark years, weaving and unweaving what you are.

Mahler in New York,"Now when I go out, the wind pulls me
into the grave. I go out
to part the hair of a child I left behind,
and he pushes his face into my cuffs, to smell the wind.
If I carry my father with me, it is the way
a horse carries autumn in its mane.
If I remember my brother,
it is as if a buck had knelt down
in a room I was in.
I kneel, and the wind kneels down in me.
What is it to have a history, a flock
buried in the blindness of winter?
Try crawling with two violins
into the hallway of your father’s hearse.
It is filled with sparrows.
Sometimes I go to the field
and the field is bare. There is the wind,
which entrusts me;
there is a woman walking with a pail of milk,
a man who tilts his bread in the sun;
there is the black heart of a mare
in the milk—or is it the wind, the way it goes?
I don’t know about the wind, about the way
it goes. All I know is that sometimes
someone will pick up the black violin of his childhood
and start playing—that it sits there on his shoulder
like a thin gray falcon asleep in its blinders,
and that we carry each other this way
because it is the way we would like to be carried:
sometimes with mercy, sometimes without.

The Biology of Random Intention,"I frowned over the soft zodiac of brown wrinkles
attempting to squint clarity
into my palm’s cracked plate
as if it might be a map to someplace
important. I, too, wanted to disappear
into others but was disappointingly singular.
Brandishing an encyclopedia,
I was stunned to learn along our personal
milky way that there were names for every pleat
& channel, every mount of flesh.
Fate line. Sun line. Money line.
Heart line. Head line. Life line.
My life line looked past repair
A coaxial cable snipped, frayed.
Since my quilted palm was my mother’s responsibility,
I asked her what these alien letters meant.

she said. Yours is the mountain. Yours is a life of work.

from behind
every mirror
while I
shaved
washed my hands
cut my hair.
How many times
have you touched me
with my own hand.
My inheritance
probably lies
in habits
that annoy me the most.
The sound
I make
clearing my throat
the broad toss
of my chest
when I walk
or the desolate
silence
we shared in our heads
in our empty rooms
in our isolated youth.
How many times
have we been
so alone
we overlooked
one another
standing
as close
as any man
can
to his own
shadow.","I do not know about myself. I’ve become a mystery to myself. It is so strange, the photograph I was given of you, because the man in it is me and not me."

The Shadow on the Stone,"      I went by the Druid stone 
   That stands in the garden white and lone,   
And I stopped and looked at the shifting shadows   
   That at some moments there are thrown
   From the tree hard by with a rhythmic swing,   
   And they shaped in my imagining
To the shade that a well-known head and shoulders   
   Threw there when she was gardening.
      I thought her behind my back,
   Yea, her I long had learned to lack,
And I said: “I am sure you are standing behind me,   
   Though how do you get into this old track?”
   And there was no sound but the fall of a leaf   
   As a sad response; and to keep down grief
I would not turn my head to discover
   That there was nothing in my belief.
      Yet I wanted to look and see
   That nobody stood at the back of me;
But I thought once more: “Nay, I’ll not unvision   
   A shape which, somehow, there may be.”
   So I went on softly from the glade,
   And left her behind me throwing her shade,   
As she were indeed an apparition—
   My head unturned lest my dream should fade.","“I am sure you are standing behind me,    Though how do you get into this old track?” “I would not turn my head to discover that there was nothing in my belief’ “ “Nay, I’ll not unvision that there may be”"

There is a list of things making it bearable:

a loud song a strong song a highway that knows you
sweet tea an orange cat a helping hand
an unforgettable dinner
a laugh that escapes you and deflates you
like a pink balloon left soft with room
for goodness to take hold
For those who have looked in the mirror and begged
For those with weak knees and an attitude
For those called “sensitive” or “too much”
For those not called enough

My Life Is a Memory,"translated from the Spanish by William George Williams
When I met her I loved myself.
It was she who had my best singing,
she who set flame to my obscure youth,
she who raised my eyes toward heaven.
Her love moistened me, it was an essence.
I folded my heart like a handkerchief 
and after I turned the key on my existence.
And thus it perfumes my soul
with a distant and subtle poetry.
    Mi vida es un recuerdo 
  Cuando la conocí me amé á mí mismo.
Fué la que tuvo mi mejor lirismo,
la que encendió mi obscura adolescencia,
la que mis ojos levantó hacia el cielo.
     Me humedeció su amor, que era una esencia,
doblé mi corazón como un pañuelo
y después le eché llave á mi existencia.

     Y por eso perfuma el alma mía
con lejana y diluida poesía.","When I met her I loved myself. It was she who had my best singing, she who set flame to my obscure youth. Her love moistened me, it was an essence."

The Lost Bird,"translated from the Spanish by William Cullen Bryant
          My bird has flown away,
Far out of sight has flown, I know not where.
          Look in your lawn, I pray,
          Ye maidens, kind and fair,
And see if my beloved bird be there.
          His eyes are full of light;
The eagle of the rock has such an eye;
          And plumes, exceeding bright,
          Round his smooth temples lie,
And sweet his voice and tender as a sigh.
          Look where the grass is gay
With summer blossoms, haply there he cowers;
          And search, from spray to spray,
          The leafy laurel-bowers,
For well he loves the laurels and the flowers.
          Find him, but do not dwell,
With eyes too fond, on the fair form you see,
          Nor love his song too well;
          Send him, at once, to me,
Or leave him to the air and liberty.
          For only from my hand
He takes the seed into his golden beak,
          And all unwiped shall stand
          The tears that wet my cheek,
Till I have found the wanderer I seek.
          My sight is darkened o’er,
Whene’er I miss his eyes, which are my day,
          And when I hear no more
          The music of his lay,
My heart in utter sadness faints away.
    El pájaro perdido 
     ¡Huyó con vuelo incierto,
Y de mis ojos ha desparecido! . . .
¡Mirad si a vuestro huerto
Mi pájaro querido,
Niñas hermosas, por acaso ha huido!
   Sus ojos relucientes
Son como los del águila orgullosa;
Plumas resplandecientes
En la cabeza airosa
Lleva, y su voz es tierna y armoniosa.
   Mirad si cuidadoso
Junto a las flores se escondió en la grama:
Ese laurel frondoso
Mirad rama por rama,
Que él los laureles y las flores ama.
   Si le halláis por ventura,
No os enamore su amoroso acento;
No os prende su hermosura:
Volvédmele al momento,
O dejadle, si no, libre en el viento.
   Porque su pico de oro
Sólo en mi mano toma la semilla,
Y no enjugaré el lloro
Que veis en mi mejilla
Hasta encontrar mi prófuga avecilla.
   Mi vista se oscurece
Si sus ojos no ve, que son mi día;
Mi ánima desfallece
Con la melancolía
De no escucharle ya su melodía.","The poem was written in Spanish by William Cullen Bryant. It is about a man who loses his beloved bird. He searches for the bird in the grass, looking for it in his lawn."

"Barnes & Noble, 1999","I was a boy in a bookstore, “a bathhouse,” I’ll joke

what language I could from books & men who stood hard
before me. This is what it means to be astonishing;
to thieve speech and sense from the undeserving.

the words I know for this I made into small razors,

"Residence, Laramie, Wyoming","If we think of time as a bolt
of cloth we cut swatches from, blue
cotton that begins its immediate slow
fray, then for a moment you were
the newest well-built thing in the world:
the perfect angle of your peaked roof,
unwarped frames of your windows,
glass so clear it almost isn’t there.
Then those who planned you hanged
white curtains, arranged the furniture—
the kitchen table with its smooth
wood legs, the brown leather loveseat
against a dustless living room wall.
The closets grew gray suits, a patterned
morning dress with sunflowers, the yellow
still brilliantine and deep twenty years
before it faded to unripe lemon rind.
And the bassinet in the nursery upstairs
a room whose walls they papered
with cartooned race cars. As the body does,
when it’s allowed to grow old, the bones
of the house will eventually begin to creak,
the plumbing to lose its constant wrestle
to contain the push of water

puts away his brush, canvas filled with another
well-made thing, the house you grew up in
with its green lawn and shrubs spreading
forever out of the frame, no one knows but he

like a painting on a cattle fence outside Laramie.

and fallow needles. Were it not for their
height, their naïve placement beneath
the power lines, too near the neighbor’s
fences, his widow would not have had them

bared and countable. I wish they were
not—then would I not return there

once was, a bright future coming

of some woods a few blocks from the house,
the trees razed later for condos, a strip mall.
You’re a miracle, she said. You’ll do great things.
But I haven’t. I remember the September grass
wilting, the dead leaves’ veins crunching underfoot.
From that day I’ve been lost, wandering
through a field of flawed memories and missed
signposts. What she should have said is
you will learn even your skin is a borrowed mask.

To Edison,"translated from the Spanish by Agnes Blake Poor
In thee, the spirit of thy native soil
    Draws breath and stirs with potent fruitful life.
Thou, from the field of elemental strife,
    Seizest the guerdon of thy noble toil.
Franklin before, along the slender coil
    Called down the fiery sparks in heaven rife.
Traced the quick ray, like sharp dividing knife;
    And to the earth brought down the lightning’s spoil.
And thou, the living glory of thy race,
    Preservest for all time the spoken word;
Defying ignorance’s numbing trace;
    Despising falsehood’s deadly withering breath.
The immortal tree of life thy hand conferred,
    Even on the edge of the abyss of death.",The poem was written by Agnes Blake and published in 18th century Spain. It was written in the time of King James II. The words are translated from the Spanish into English.
"Lord, I Ask a Garden . . .","translated from the Spanish by William George Williams
Lord, I ask a garden in a quiet spot
where there may be a brook with a good flow,
an humble little house covered with bell-flowers,
and a wife and a son who shall resemble Thee.
I should wish to live many years, free from hates,
and make my verses, as the rivers
that moisten the earth, fresh and pure.
Lord, give me a path with trees and birds.
I wish that you would never take my mother,
for I should wish to tend to her as a child
and put her to sleep with kisses, when somewhat old
she may need the sun.
I wish to sleep well, to have a few books,
an affectionate dog that will spring upon my knees,
a flock of goats, all things rustic,
and to live off the soil tilled by my own hand.
To go into the field and flourish with it;
to seat myself at evening under the rustic eaves,
to drink in the fresh mountain perfumed air
and speak to my little one of humble things.
At night to relate him some simple tale,
teach him to laugh with the laughter of water
and put him to sleep thinking that he may later on
keep that freshness of the moist grass.
And afterward, the next day, rise with dawn
admiring life, bathe in the brook,
milk my goats in the happiness of the garden
and add a strophe to the poem of the world.
    Señor, yo pido un huerto 
  Señor, yo pido un huerto en un rincón tranquilo
donde haya una quebrada con aguas abundantes
una casita humilde cubierta de campánulas,
y una mujer y un hijo que sean como Vos.
Yo quisiera vivir muchos años, sin odios,
y hacer como los ríos que humedecen la tierra
mis versos y mis actos frescos y de puros.
Señor, dadme un sendero con árboles y pájaros.
Yo deseo que nunca os llevéis a mi madre,
porque a mi me gustara cuidarla cual a un niño
y dormirla con besos, cuando ya viejecita 
necesite del sol.
Quiero tener buen sueño, algunos pocos libros
un perro cariñoso que me salte a las piernas,
un rebaño de cabras, toda cosa silvestre,
y vivir de la tierra labrada por mis manos.
Salir a la campiña, y florecer en ella;
sentarme por la tarde, bajo el rústico alero,
a beber aire fresco y olorosa a montaña,
y hablarle a mi pequeño de las cosas humildes
Por la noche contarle algún cuento sencillo,
enseñarle a reír con la risa del agua
y dormirle pensando en que pueda, a la tarde,
guardar esa frescura de la hierba embebida;
y luego, al otro día, levantarme a la aurora
admirando la vida, bañarme en la quebrada,
ordeñar a mis cabras en la dicha del huerto,
y agregar una estrofa al poema del mundo.","The poem was written in Spanish and is called ""The Poem of the World"" It is written in the form of a sonnet and includes the words ""Lord, give me a path with trees and birds"""

Homage to Darío,"translated from the Spanish by Agnes Blake Poor
Sadly mourns the fair princess, while her golden bees,
Clustering together in the stillness of the sun,
Murmur faintly like the waves of enchanted seas.
Knight and Squire around her are striving, every one,
Vainly striving to awake on her cheek the blush,
Soft as on an evening cloud the last sunset flush.
Sadly mourns the centaur troop from the classic lands,
Suddenly arrested on some distant shore,
By the cadence of the waves, like a funeral band,
Till they cover all the marge, and are heard no more.
Till the last faint ripple, with a sobbing breath,
Dies away in silence, and all is still as death.
Sacred swans of poesy, snow-white and snow-soft,
Floating heaps of slumber on waveless lakes afar;
Royal train of peacocks, with crested heads aloft,
Such as pace majestic, linked to Juno’s car.
Or in Versailles gardens step slowly one by one,
Past the steps of Pompadour’s rose-heaped, rose-hung throne.
Floating vapors slowly rise and wreathe, wind-swept and pale;
Hiding arching necks of snow, shining crests of blue;
Sad and sweet the murmurs through the misty veil,
Till the poet’s song resounds, the flowerless desert through;
And but for a moment rings the Sonatina’s lay,
Roaring winds and thunder peals sweep it far away.
                  *      *      *      *      *      *
The spectral Archer of the Northern sky,
Bends his great bow across the sphere on high;
Through the unmeasured realms of night and day,
Speeds his black arrow on its destined way.
It strikes, but pierces not, the poet’s breast,
His empty quiver near him lies at rest,
And over him sinks slowly in the West
            The Archer Boy.
Let no loud weeping chill the budding bloom,
That elves and nymphs have wreathed about his tomb,
The gentle Syrinx mourns his shortened years,
And on his laurels Pan sheds quiet tears;
In the cathedral raise the exile’s Psalm,
That through the transepts breathes like sorrow’s balm,
And in the tinted window rises calm
            The Archer Boy
And now the band of those who loved him best
Follows him slowly to his place of rest.
To the slow beating of the muffled drum
With heads bowed down and measured tread they come.
Pale and serene, fixed in triumphant peace,
His noble face bids lamentation cease,
His only fitting requiem shall be
The pealing Psalm that tells of victory.
The blazoned banners float above his bier,
And from blue far-off waters rises clear
            The swan-song on the ear!","The poem was written in Spanish and translated by Agnes Blake. It tells the story of the death of the Archer Boy, who was killed by an arrow."
The Art of Shooting in the Dark,"after Pedro Pietri
We were      nocturnal players, 
Bats in ball,      & ever since Don Pedro said 
There are Puerto Ricans      on the moon 
The night is      my cousin      & the clustered stars 
My cousin      & Saturn’s little ring of smoke      my second cousin 
Though not the same ring      as a freshly snapped Medalla bottle      which
My abuelo      also named Pedro      apparently liked too much 
But back to the moon      the first rock      dollop of sugar  
& slinging hoop in the dark      which we learned was a game
      of approximation
Less math      more muscle memory      less Mozart      more Machito 
Like descarga      more riff      more wrist. 
We set our eyes      on not seeing      but feeling a thing through, indeed
From elbow to hip      wherever the orange lip might lead","Puerto Ricans are nocturnal players, like Pedro Pietri. The night is the moon, my cousin, Saturn, & a dollop of sugar."
By the Sea,"translated from the Spanish by Muna Lee
I embraced her fifteen years,
    And kissed, as I drew to me,
The flower-like face, the chestnut hair,
    Beside a singing sea.
“Think of me, never forget—
    No matter how far I may be!”
And I saw a shooting star
    Fall suddenly into the sea.","“Think of me, never forget. No matter how far I may be!” And I saw a shooting star fall suddenly into the sea."
Escape,"translated from the Spanish by Muna Lee
The dungeon crushes me—over my restless spirit
    Pass dark thoughts unspoken.
My poet’s wings, even in unfolding,
    Against four walls are broken.
Entombed and alive! The nights are eternal,
    And eternal are the days.
Sorrows companion me, spies are about me,
    The fetter upon me weighs.
But on closing my eyes—(light, sky, and meadow!)—
    Broken I see my chain.
With my love on my arm I breathe deep in the garden
    Of magnolia and vervain.
I delight in the air, in the running water,
    Fresh as my belovèd one.
There is still something good despots cannot imprison,
    Nor heap chains upon!",The poem was written in Spanish and has been translated from the Spanish by Muna Lee. It is about a poet who is trapped in a dungeon and is overcome by dark thoughts.
Mist,"translated from the Spanish by Roderick Gill
O faint remembrances of vanished days
    That stole away on such a velvet wing
O’er meads and groves, o’er plains and mountain ways,
    What grief and sorrow to my heart you bring!
Come back without the shadow of your care,
    Come back in silence and without a moan,
As the birds cross the unregarding air
    Till none may tell the whence or whither flown.
Come back amid the pallor of the moon
    That silvers all the azure rifts at sea,
Or in the deadly mist that in a swoon
    Engulfs afar the green palm’s royal tree.
Bring back the murmur of the doves that made
    Their little nests so neighborly to mine;
The vibrant airs––the fragrances that played
     Around the peaks that saw my cradle shine.
Sing in my ear the melodies of old,
    So sweet and joyous to my inmost heart;
O faint remembrances two breasts should hold,
    Two breasts that Destiny was loath to part!
What matter if a sigh steals through the dream
    That shows the withered vine in flower again?––
So that remembrances in singing seem,
    O tremulous lyre, to speak my endless pain!",The song was written in Spanish and was written by Roderick Gill. It is about the loss of a loved one who has died and the grief that comes with it.
Canción,"translated by Peter Anthony Motteux
What makes me languish and complain?––Oh, ’tis disdain!
What yet more fiercely tortures me?––’Tis jealousy.
How have I patience lost?––By absence crossed.
Then hopes farewell, there’s no relief;
I sink beneath oppressing grief;
Nor can a wretch, without despair,
Scorn, jealousy, and absence bear.
What in my breast, this anguish drove?––Intruding love.
What could such mighty ills create?––Blind fortune’s hate.
What cruel powers my fate approve?––The powers above.
Then let me bear and cease to moan;
’Tis glorious thus to be undone;
When these invade, who dares oppose?
Heaven, love, and fortune are my foes. What shall I find a speedy cure?––Death is sure.
No milder means to set me free?––Inconstancy.
Can nothing else my pains assuage?––Distracting age.
What! die or change? ––Lucinda lose?––
Oh, let me rather madness choose!
But judge, ye gods, what we endure
When death or madness is the cure!","The poem was written by Peter Anthony Motteux. It is titled ‘Scorn, jealousy, and absence bear. What shall I find a speedy cure? What is sure?’"
Let Me Go Warm,"translated by H. W. Longfellow
Let me go warm and merry still;
And let the world laugh, an’ it will.
Let other muse on earthly things,––
The fall of thrones, the fate of kings,
     And those whose fame the world doth fill;
Whilst muffins sit enthroned in trays
And orange-punch in winter sways
The merry scepter of my days;––
     And let the world laugh, an’ it will.
He that the royal purple wears,
From golden plate a thousand cares
     Doth swallow as a gilded pill;
On feasts like these I turn my back,
Whilst puddings in my roasting-jack
Beside the chimney hiss and crack;––
     And let the world laugh, an’ it will.
And when the wintry tempest blows,
And January’s sleets and snows
     Are spread o’er every vale and hill,
With one to tell a merry tale
O’er roasted nuts and humming ale,
I sit, and care not for the gale;––
     And let the world laugh, an’ it will.
Let merchants traverse seas and lands
For silver mines and golden sands;
     Whilst I beside some shadowry rill
Just where its bubbling fountain swells
Do sit and gather stones and shells,
And hear the tale the blackbird tells;––
     And let the world laugh, an’ it will.
For Hero’s sake the Grecian lover
The stormy Hellespont swam over;
     I cross without the fear of ill
The wooden bridge that slow bestrides
The madrigal’s enchanting sides,
Or barefoot wade through Yepe’s tides;––
     And let the world laugh, an’ it will.
But since the Fates so cruel prove,
That Pyramus should die of love,
     And love should gentle Thisbe kill;
My Thisbe be an apple-tart,
The sword I plunge into her heart
The tooth that bites the crust apart,––
     And let the world laugh, an’ it will.","The poem was written by H. W. Longfellow in the early 1800s. It is one of the most famous poems of all time, and has been translated by many."

Verses to the Moon,"translated from the Spanish by William George Williams
Oh moon, who now look over the roof
of the church, in the tropical calm
to be saluted by him who has been out all night,
to be barked at by the dogs of the suburbs,
Oh moon who in your silence have laughed at
all things! In your sidereal silence 
when, keeping carefully in the shadow, the
municipal judge steals from some den.
But you offer, saturnine traveler,
with what eloquence in mute space
consolation to him whose life is broken,
while there sing to you from a drunken brawl
long-haired, neurasthenic bards,
and lousy creatures who play dominos.
    Versos a la luna 
  ¡Oh, luna, que hoy te asomas al tejado
de la iglesia, en la calma tropical,
para que te salude un trasnochado
y te ladren los perros de arrabal!
¡Oh, luna! . . . ¡En tu silencio te has burlado
de todo! . . . En tu silencio sideral,
viste anoche robar en despoblado
. . . ¡y el ladrón era un Juez municipal!
Mas tú ofreces, viajera saturnina,
con qué elocuencia en los espacios mudos,
consuelo al que la vida laceró,
mientras te cantan, en cualquier cantina,
neurasténicos bardos melenudos
y piojosos, que juegan dominó. . .","""Oh moon who in your silence have laughed at                all things"" translated from the Spanish by William George Williams.

I Know Not,"Holy God, where are You—Whom I fail to find
Although laboriously I probe and search?
Wrapt in a dense obscurity, I am blind;
And when I pray, I enter in the church.
Doubts in the centre of my spirit dwell
Whose harsh accent my bitter grief revives.
The mollusk is happier far than man; the shell
Oppresses it—and yet within it lives.
Yet life I dare not shorten, since I see—
Mute, sad, mysterious—the narrow grave,
And the certain riddle with a hidden key.
Shadows behind, before me—all about me.
Everywhere shadows, within me and without me—
Even in Your temple with its shadowy nave!","""I am blind; and when I pray, I enter in the church"" ""The mollusk is happier far than man; the shellOppresses it—and yet within it lives"" ""Even in Your temple with its shadowy nave!"""
Intimate Prayer,"Blessed forever be 
My hamlet in its simplicity 
With its mornings calm and bright, 
Lilac-covered, or blue or white. 
Where evening as a perfume goes, 
And twilight’s colored like a rose. 
With nights whose beauty nothing mars, 
Drunken with the moon and stars. 
Where the ancient steeple airy
Watches like a visionary. 
With tiny houses that beguile
One’s spirit with their humble smile. 
Where ancient laurels touch the sky, 
And from tall cotes the pigeons fly. 
Where the rivulet and river
Bathe the feet of the village ever. 
Where blossomy branches are the yield
Of the fertile fragrant field. 
With hearts good and happy, making 
Life’s old hurt leave off its aching—
Hearts that crave no other’s pleasure,
But the days by duties measure; 
Child-like souls who seem to be 
All courtesy and gravity. 
For this, and for much more that I 
From memory will not let die, 
Blessed forever be
My hamlet in its simplicity! ","Blessed forever be my hamlet in its simplicity. Blessed forever be  my village. With its mornings calm and bright,                 Lilac-covered, or blue or white. And twilight’s colored like a rose."
When the Neighbor Boys Gathered,"         It seemed all their faces grew
sticky as they watched. Fruit flies stuck to their chins.
Like any soft boy, I am constantly reminded 
         of how much better I look
inside-out. It was in Kevin’s backyard 
         where I learned how to swallow
         a boot or two.
         This was the birthplace of my knees,
new cells coating the gravel, red lesions 
         like fat worms along my legs.
I didn’t always hate them—the boys I mean. 
It was the closest I’ve come to baptism.
Head locked against his naked torso. His sour sweat 
burning my eyes shut. That restless timbre
growing in my head, as I pursed my lips and pressed 
         my face into his ribs, left a trail of saliva
along his bare skin. Muscles withered
         and dried out as he pushed me away, disgusted
         at how hard my pulse had become 
in his arms. This is how the summer opened
its wet mouth, how it wrung the blood 
                         from a body and rebuilt it
                                                    from the mud.
 ","Like any soft boy, I am constantly reminded of how much better I look inside-out. It was in Kevin’s backyard where I learned how to swallow a boot or two. This was the birthplace of my knees, new cells coating the gravel."
The Story,"My mother opens my bedroom
door and gags on the overwhelming scent
of urine, like something died, she says, 
in the story that follows me
to every family gathering,
a hound locked on the scent
of a wandering child. It was a phase
my mother said lasted until I was fourteen,
or around the time I started doing my own laundry. 
She goes on to tell them about the piles of wet
clothes hidden in the back of my closet, 
like something died—again
we all know this story,
a boy gets touched and then ruins
the upholstery, or a boy rubs himself 
in the back of the school bus
until his jeans become a shade darker.
I never told my mother I was molested,
never told her that story, the one 
where a boy finds a tongue,
ten years later, fermenting 
in a jar. I never told her
how someone reached inside me 
and turned on all the faucets.
 ",The writer was molested when he was a boy. He never told his mother about the incident. He says he never told her how someone reached inside him and turned on all the faucets.
I Want Nothing,"to do with my mother’s
sadness, her mouth:
a pockmark on every door
that opens onto a memorial scene, 
her mouth: the beginning
of traffic. Odd to think
of it as an ugly and frequent
song on the radio,
a small bird shitting
and dying in my hands.
He is dead, she says,
over and over again,
except in Vietnamese,
which to me doesn’t sound
as tragic—a little uglier,
maybe, but less tragic,
for sure. The house phone
on her lap sings its dead
hum into the static air
of our living room. Who?
Who? I ask. I shake her
shoulders, Who?
When she finally looks
at me through the slit
of her black bangs,
she tells me about the man
she would have married
if she stayed in Vietnam,
and my posture straightens,
and my eyes roll, and I am 
relieved at the absence
of my own grief, and I hate him, 
this man, this dead man
that won’t stay gone
now that he’s gone
for good, now that he has built
this house of meat to rot
and stew on the sunniest days, 
now that he fills the marrow
in each bone of my mother’s regret. 
When she thinks of love 
either she’s a widow or divorced, 
and I believed for a while
that regret is leaving
the burning house 
empty-handed, but he is
already ash, and I tell her
she made the right choice, 
which is funny, cause I hate
my father, and often forget
that he’s still alive.
 ","The author's mother talks about the man she would have married had she stayed in Vietnam. The man is dead, she says, over and over again, except in Vietnamese, which to me doesn’t sound tragic. I tell her she made the right choice, but he is already ash, he says."
The Dock,"No one wants to go near the lake 
that swallowed two more boys
this year. Sad story, yes, but we’re thankful 
to have a pretty place to be discreet.
Not saying a basement can’t be pretty, 
and don’t get me wrong, I am a fan
of the mass-produced hotel art,
the same photo hanging above each bed
makes it easier to pretend each new room 
is still our room, makes me crave a life
of dull decor and basic cable, makes my mouth 
water, really. I bite the lips off of a Styrofoam cup
and spit them at the ducks that swim past.
Wait. Don’t eat that. Fuck.
This is the first time I hear him laugh out loud. 
With him, there are few noises I can recognize.
A fly lands on his cheek and I try to brush it 
away, but before my hand can cast
a shadow on the bridge of his nose,
the fly burrows into him. He doesn’t flinch,
just winks—and now there’s one on his knee, 
and another lands in his dimple, one on each
eyelid. There are hundreds now, all digging 
or moving underneath his skin, all bubbling
behind that firm smile. His eyes begin
to vibrate, and he doesn’t reach for me. He doesn’t
need me here, really. I am no expert, or exorcist, 
or great love. I am just another boy sitting
an arm’s length away from someone he doesn't recognize 
in the light. He opens his mouth and they all fly out,
not a swarm, but a single-file line, a thin braid of black
hair, the longest exhale from a sinking car—That’s it.
There. That’s the noise I’m so familiar with.","A fly lands on his cheek and I try to brush it away, but before my hand can cast a shadow on the bridge of his nose, the fly burrows into him.

Nocturne,"One night, 
One night filled with murmurs and perfumes and the music of wings, 
One night
When fantastic fireflies blazed in the moist nuptial shadows, 
By my side slowly, clasped to me, pale and silent, 
As if a presentiment of infinite bitterness
Agitated the most secret depths of your heart,
Over the blossomy path through the meadow
You wandered; 
And the full moon
Scattered white light over bluish skies, boundless and deep. 
And your shadow, 
Frail and languid,
And my shadow
By the rays of the moon projected 
Over the gloomy sand, 
Joined together 
And were one,
And were one, 
And were one, 
And were one long shadow, 
And were one long shadow, 
And were one long shadow. . . . 
Tonight 
Along—my soul
Filled with infinite bitterness and pain of your death, 
Separated from you by time and space and the tomb, 
By the black infinity
Whither the voice cannot reach: 
Silent and alone
I wandered along the path, 
And I heard the dogs baying the moon, 
The pallid moon, 
And the chirrup of frogs. . . . 
I was cold, with the cold of your cheek and your brow and your beloved hands 
Among the white snows of your shroud: 
It was the cold of the sepulchre, the ice of death, 
The chill of nothingness. . . . 
And my shadow, 
By the rays of the moon projected, 
Went alone, 
Went alone, 
Went alone over the lonely plain. 
And your shadow quick and slender, 
Frail and languid, 
As in that warm night of vanished spring, 
As in that night filled murmurs and perfumes and the music of wings, 
Came close and walked with mine, 
Came close and walked with mine, 
Came close and walked with mine, 
Oh, the shadows knit together! 
Oh, the shadows of the body joined with shadows of the soul! 
Oh, shadows which seek one another in nights of sorrow and tears! ","One night,                 One night filled with murmurs and perfumes and the music of wings. One night when fantastic fireflies blazed in the moist nuptial shadows."
The Fugitive,"Fair vision, undefined and fleeting, 
Whose light foot hardly prints the lawn; 
Now here, now there, my charmed gaze meeting
To be more quickly yet withdrawn. 
A shadow flitting through the wicket, 
A sunny flash upon the air 
Where just behind the lilac thicket
I catch a gleam of golden hair. 
And starting at the passing splendor, 
I lose it like a shooting star. 
One dazzled glance alone I send her, 
Before she vanishes afar. 
Her silver laugh rings musically 
Along the garden’s winding ways;
I hasten down the shady alley, 
Where her white dress flits from my gaze. 
I pour my soul, lest she be near me, 
In some old song, beloved of time; 
But only echo deigns to hear me, 
And chill me with her mocking chime. 
The dream is o’er, I wait in vain; 
But will she never come again? ","""The Dream is o’er, I wait in vain"" is a short story written by the British poet David Walliams. The story is about a girl who falls in love with a man."
Boy,"My mother’s favorite story, a dull one, of course— 
            is that she did not scream during my birth, 
instead dug her nails into her sister’s wrist, severing
            a vein, and killing her—I’m only joking. 
She lived. I did say this was her favorite story after all.
                          :::
               They say if the mother is silent
               during birth, then the child will grow
               up without the ability to smell or decipher 
               maps, but will indeed grow up.
               They say if the baby is born silent, 
               then it’s probably a faggot, or dead, 
               or will be eventually.
                          :::
He was a stupid child. Ate dirt they said. Ate glass 
and people’s wallets. Kept a farm of cigarette butts 
in his cheeks. Smelled like a highway,
but sounded like a boy.
Stood on the overpass and swore 
he could hear her screaming.

The Hurricane,"Translated by William Cullen Bryant
Lord of the winds! I feel thee nigh;
I know thy breath in the burning sky!
And I wait with a thrill in every vein,
For the coming of the hurricane!
And lo! on the wings of the heavy gales,
Through the boundless arch of heaven he sails;
Silent and slow and terribly strong,
The mighty shadow is borne along,
Like the dark eternity to come;
While the world below, dismayed and dumb,
Through the calm of the thick hot atmosphere
Looks up at its gloomy folds with fear.
They darken fast—, and the golden blaze
Of the sun is quenched in the lurid haze,
And he sends through the shade a funeral ray,
A glare that is neither night nor day,
A beam that touches, with hues of death,
The clouds above and the earth beneath.
To its covert glides the silent bird,
While the hurricane’s distant voice is heard
Uplifted among the mountains round,
And the forests hear and answer the sound.
He is come! he is come! do ye not behold
His ample robes on the wind unrolled?
Giant of air! we bid thee hail.
How his gray skirts toss in the whirling gale;
How his huge and writhing arms are bent
To clasp the zone of firmament,
And fold, at length, in their dark embrace
From mountain to mountain the visible space.
Darker—still darker! the whirlwinds bear
The dust of the plains to the middle air;
And hark to the crashing, long and loud,
Of the chariot of God in the thunder cloud!
You may trace its path by the flashes that start
From the rapid wheels where’er they dart.
And the fire-bolts leap to the world below,
And flood the skies with a lurid glow.
What roar is that? ’tis the rain that breaks
In torrents away from the airy lakes,
Heavily poured on the shuddering ground,
And shedding a nameless horror around.
Ah! well known woods and mountains and skies,
With the very clouds! Ye are lost to my eyes.
I seek you vainly and see in your place
The shadowy tempest that sweeps through space,
A whirling ocean that fills the wall
Of the crystal heavens, and buries all.
And I, cut off from the world, remain
Alone with the terrible hurricane.",The poem was written in the first half of the 19th century. It was written by the French poet Jean-Michel Cousteau and published in Paris in 1883.
Near the Shrine of Saint Naum,"translated from the Arabic by Kareem James Abu-Zeid
I stood in the red church,
its tiny domes like buds

I stood near the saint’s resting place
while a tourist laid her cheek on the tombstone
to hear his beating heart.
But I was no tourist,
and the saint left the room with me,
and the church the builders wrote in his memory
was nothing more
than a passing dream in his eternal sleep.
The tourists come in vain,
as do the believers.

Abraham Lincoln Turns to Listen to the Lower Ninth,"Unsteady aquanauts,
we leave behind the capsules of our mothers’ bodies.
This is who we are,
moving along the tributaries that take us away
and back home
to the delta and the sea.
Pushing along Okwata—wide wide water
we live
Bayougoula Mougoulacha
Chitmacha Oumas 
Tangipaho Colapissa,
Quinipissa Accapissa
among the pines and cypress,
before Pontchartrain 
manacles and the deep cuts
into what we know.
Pushing through the water
inside the body of Jesus
the Lord
the Wonderer,
we huddle indecently,
resisting the foul compression
that would shame us
into that which we are not
that would turn our salty blood
into molasses
rum
cooking oil,
that would turn our bodies
into leather goods
and amusement
that would make us forget
we are water
inevitably returning to the river and the sky
always returning
baked by the sun to rising,
and falling as rain.
Pushing along the Mississippi,
Abraham Lincoln turns to see
his life and ours revolving at slow speed
shuffling into in the grand St. Louis Hotel
anywhere everywhere in New Orleans.
He watches our picked, baled and branded lives.     
Hushed by the din of trading, he watches
our lips to see what we are saying.
“They were yelling, I thought I heard yelling,” he whispers
as he watches, then
“No. Of course, not.”
Pushing against the water
so many of us leave the capsules of our mothers’ bodies
parched bloated unburied.
Spinning synchronous with the circling helicopters
we turn to gain our bearings.
Our eyes fill with the funeral water 
that cannot be left behind.
It is in our blood
it is our blood
it is in our tears
it is our tears
it is who we are now and then,
stumbling and blinded from all we have seen,
straining along the roadways that lead away
from the shelter of the delta and the sea.
Falling
falling
falling,
rain
falling into his blinking eyes.","Pushing through the water inside the body of Jesus, we huddle indecently, resisting the foul compression. Unsteady aquanauts, we leave behind the capsules of our mothers’ bodies."
How To Forgive,"She asks me to write a list
of all the names I’ve been called.
And then a list of things
that are killing me.
Where to start? Susie. Sue.
Big Head. Men have called me cold.
Men I know, men I don’t.
It’s all over the news
how they want to kill me.
It doesn’t matter what they
call me. When I was 17, I kneeled
on the stained carpet at Men’s Wearhouse,
looping a tape measure around
a small boy’s waist and he showed me
my name. He pulled his eyes slant
as I measured the distance
between belly button and floor: inseam
or outseam, it’s hard to keep track.
A wedding, his father said.
There was going to be a wedding.
The boy needed a tux.
I don’t like this memory
because I did nothing.
In remembering,
I become nothing again.
Not long after in college,
I was sorting clothes in the back
of a Goodwill. Court-ordered community
service. An older man took
his time looking me up
and down as I sweat through my shirt,
threw pit-stained blouses
into the discard pile,
everything else the salvaging bin.
I went home with him for years,
not knowing about the prior assaults.
Would my knowing have changed
anything? He was gentle
to my face. I only ignored
his texts sometimes.
Men have destroyed me
for less. Even the boy.
I’m supposed to tell you
I forgive him—
he was just a boy.
I forgive myself instead.","When she was 17, a man measured the waist of a small boy at Men’s Wearhouse. He pulled his eyes slant as he measured the distance between belly button and floor: inseam or outseam. The boy needed a tux for a wedding, his father said."
Tomorrow,"translated by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow
Lord, what am I, that with unceasing care
   Thou did’st seek after me, that Thou did’st wait
   Wet with unhealthy dews before my gate,
And pass the gloomy nights of winter there?
Oh, strange delusion, that I did not greet
   Thy blest approach, and oh, to heaven how lost
   If my ingratitude’s unkindly frost
Has chilled the bleeding wounds upon Thy feet.
How oft my guardian angel gently cried,
   “Soul, from thy casement look, and thou shalt see
   How He persists to knock and wait for thee!”
      And oh, how often to that Voice of sorrow,
“Tomorrow we will open,” I replied,
   And when the morrow came I answered still “Tomorrow.”","The poem was written by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow in 18th century. It was written in the form of a letter to his son, Henry."
Peace,"Written in exile in Uruguay, 1838 “Deh fate un corpo sol di membri amici, Fare un capo che gli altri indirizzi e frene.” —Gerusalemme Liberata.
Protect, O Lord, our glorious heritage!
   Now by thine aid delivers from the yoke
        Of many a weary age.
   Thy never-ceasing bounty we invoke
        To make us truly free;
To guard and guide our hard-won liberty.
Let it not fade, the young and tender shoot,
   In the hot bread of faction’s withering blast;
        Let us but grasp one fruit,
   One little humble one, and hold it fast.
        We are but yet new-born;
Have we deserved the fate of States outworn?
Save us, we pray thee; the temptation spare
   That on America’s ambition waits;
      And warn us of the snare,
   That caught our sister of the silver gates,
      Fairer and proper then,
But now an outcast for the scorn of men.
Send here the pair divine, Concord and Peace,
   Daughters of Virtue, driven from the West.
      Let strife and hatred cease,
   And then our country shall be doubly blest.
      In Law's benignant shade,
Science and Art shall prosper unafraid.
Before their radiant, all-pervading light,
   Like sunrise breaking over hill and plain,
      Will fly the ghosts of night;
   Blind Superstition and Intolerance vain.
      The Faith of Freedom born,
Shall come upon the pinions of the morn.
No more the brazen trumpet’s summons wild
   Shall waken terror o’er the startled lea;
      The mother and her child
   Shall rest at eve beneath the twilight tree;
      And from the smiling fields,
The peasant gather all his labor yields.
But now the poet’s lyre exults no more;
   Sadly it answers to his failing hand.
      Yet on a foreign shore,
   Have I no prayer for thee, my native land?
      For Argentina rings
No chord of hope along its silver strings?
Speak her name tenderly, not to upbraid,
   But with the heart to pity and regret;
      And draw forgiving shade,
   Over the sins that we may not forget.
      For her there yet may be,
A resurrection day we shall not see.
Give her your prayers, sons of the happier East,
   When on the altar bounteous gifts you lay,
      On your Thanksgiving feast.
   And in return will grateful exiles pray
      “For many a coming age
Protect, O Lord, our glorious heritage!”","Gerusalemme Liberata was written in exile in Uruguay, 1838. “Deh fate un corpo sol di membri amici, Fare un capo che gli altri indirizzi e frene” —Gerusalemmede Liberata."
Canción,"translated from the Spanish by George Ticknor
O Love, I never, never thought
    Thy power had been so great,
    That thou couldst change my fate,
By changes in another wrought,
Till now, alas! I know it.
I thought I knew thee well,
    For I had known thee long;
    But though I felt thee strong,
I felt not all thy spell.
Nor ever, ever had I thought
    Thy power had been so great,
    That thou couldst change my fate,
By changes in another wrought,
Till now, alas! I know it.","I thought I knew thee well,                    For I had known thee long. But though I felt thee strong,                I felt not all thy spell."
The African Mother,"Translated by Agnes Blake Poor
Tirai-je enfans de la rive africaine.
    Qui cultivent pour nous la terre americaine?
Differents de couleur, ils ont les mêmes droits;
    Vous-mêmes contres vous les armez de vos lois.
      —Delille, Malheur et Pitie, Chant I.
“And hast thou sped upon the ocean wind,
     Say, cruel pirate, hast thou come for this?
                  Not to leave one behind.
To rob my humble home of all its bliss?
     Come back and look into my cabin door
                  And find me there alone.
Their parting footsteps will return no more;
All of my own are gone, forever gone.
                  Husband and children taken
                  And only I forsaken!
O bear me after them, thou iron heart,
     And to toil with them, I will be thy slave!
                  Or if death be their part,
Cast us together in an unknown grave.
But why pray I to thee, by prayer unmoved?
     Thou hast no children, thou has never loved.
“Free waves their flag, the golden sun displaying
        Celestial globe on skies of heavenly blue!
                  The sportive breezes straying,
Waft on our sight the wonder strange and new;
        While the relentless crew
Dart like wild beasts on weaker creatures preying.
        Darken, thou sun, thy fiery light,
And die away in black eternal night.
“What see I here? his quiver and his bow
        Shattered and useless on the trampled sand?
. . . . . . . My hero! Well I know
        They were not torn from unresisting hand.
But these with magic art
                  Can grasp the lightning’s dart
And wake the thunder clap at their command.”
        Some poor relief to find,
So wailed in grief the mourner left behind.
        They heeded not her accents of despair;
A feeble outcast worth no robber’s care.
        And full in view, with every sail unfurled
The Eagle spread her pinions to the air,
        And soared away into the western world.
        Chained in the hold beneath,
        The captives gasped for breath,
And spent their strength in vainly wasted strife,
        A groaning heap of mingled death and life.

To Her Portrait,"translated by Roderick Gill
This that you see, the false presentment planned
   With finest art and all the colored shows
   And reasoning of shade, doth but disclose
The poor deceits by earthly senses fanned!
Here where in constant flattery expand
   Excuses for the stains that old age knows,
   Pretexts again the years’ advancing snows,
The footprints of old seasons to withstand;
’Tis but vain artifact of scheming minds;
’Tis but a flower fading on the winds;
   ’Tis but a useless protest against Fate;
’Tis but stupidity without a thought,
   A lifeless shadow, if we meditate;
’Tis dead, ’tis dust, ’tis shadow, yea, ’tis nought",The poem was written in French and has been translated by Roderick Gill. It is written in the form of a sonnet. The sonnet was written by French poet Frida Ghitis. It was published in Paris in 1892.
Love,"translated from the Spanish by Agnes Blake Poor
Fair maid! believe me, love is like a lake,
    Whose crystal depths reflect thy brow of snow;
The roses on thy cheek that come and go,
    When in thy azure eyes the smiles awake,
No passing winds the liquid mirror wake,
    The cool refreshing airs so softly blow.
But hidden currents in the depths below
    The angry surface in an instant shake.
Gaze then in safety from the emerald shore;
    Nor launch thy shallop on the treacherous wave.
Even the gentle touch of thy light oar
    May rouse the slumbering peril from its grave.
Thy fragile bark is on rough waters tossed;
    The picture fades, thou sinkest, and art lost.","Love is like a lake, with hidden currents in the depths below. The angry surface in an instant shake. The picture fades, thou sinkest, and art lost."
Ecstasy,"translated by Muna Lee
Now, O Christ, seal my eyelids,
Let ice on my lips be spread!
All the hours are superfluous,
All the words are said!
He looked on me,
We looked each on each
In silence, for a long space—
Our look as rigid as death’s
The stupor that whitens the face,
In the last agony, blanched us.
After that instant life hold nothing more!
I head him speak
Convulsively. I spoke.
My words—a confusion
Of plentitude, tribulations, and fears—
Hesitated, broke.
I spoke of his destiny, of mine—
A mortar of blood and tears.
After this I know there can be nothing more.
Nothing! No perfume but would roll
Diluted down my cheek.
My ears are shut, my mouth is sealed!
What meaning for me now
By pallid earth could be revealed?
What to me are bleeding roses,
Or quiet snows congealed?
Therefore, O Christ, I plead to You now;
Though when anguished with hunger I stilled my cries.
But now, stop my pulses!
Shut the lids over my eyes!
Protect against the tempest
This flesh that was thronged with his words.
Let not the brutal daylight
Shatter this image to shards.
Receive me! I go without stain.
And I go fulfilled, like a flooded plain.","He looked on me, we looked each on each other in silence, for a long space. We looked as rigid as death’s, with a stupor that whitens the face, in the last agony, blanched us. After that instant life hold nothing more! I spoke.

Anna,"translated from the French by Marilyn Hacker

a. 
I was born with a twelfth hole. Instantly
the floating world carved its shame

No good Samaritan comes forward and only the moon like a platoon 
treacherously approaching, its extended hand like a speculum, the better
to illuminate, disgrace.

the places women leave. An unsuspecting caretaker. The bacterial streets.

is anyone’s guess.
  e.
That time Tet fell in the year of the snake. As in reptilian. As in 
no turning back. As in when I became
a child of containment. As in how like a monetary policy
I was loosed to an existence feral as a raised bayonet. As in
what the serpent might say: knowledge for knowledge’s sake
is both industrial and complex.

I was swaddled
in a blanket. Pink
wool. Threadbare.
Like everything else

           under the mattress, a new strangeness, an undiscovered way 
 
       we could touch each other, a bird never heard before

Birds from Parnassus,
swift
you dart
from the loftiest peaks;
you hover, dip,
you sway and perch
undaunted on the gold-set cornice;
you eagle,
god’s majestic legate,
who tear, who strike
song-birds in mid-flight,
my arrow whistles toward you,
swift
be off;

ah drift,
ah drift
so soft, so light,
your scarlet foot so deftly placed
to waft you neatly
to the pavement,
swan, swan
and do you really think
your song
that tunes the harp of Helios,
will save you
from the arrow-flight?
turn back,
back
to the lake of Delos;

lest all the song notes
pause and break
across a blood-stained throat
gone songless,
turn back,
back
ere it be too late,
to wave-swept Delos.

Alas, and still another,
what?
you’d place your mean nest
in the cornice?
sing, sing
my arrow-string,
tell to the thief
that plaits its house
for fledglings
in the god’s own house,
that still the Alpheus
whispers sweet
to lure
the birdlets to the place,
that still the Isthmus
shines with forests;
on the white statues
must be found
no straw nor litter
of bird-down,
Phœbos must have his portal fair;

and yet, O birds,
though this my labour
is set,
though this my task is clear,
though I must slay you,
I, god’s servant,
I who take here
my bread and life
and sweep the temple,
still I swear
that I would save you,
birds or spirits,
winged songs
that tell to men god’s will;

still, still
the Alpheus whispers clear
to lure the bird-folk
to its waters,
ah still
the Isthmus
blossoms fair;
lest all the song notes
pause and break
across a blood-stained throat
gone songless,
turn back,
back
ere it be too late,
to wave-swept Delos.","Birds from Parnassus. translated by H. D. D’Souza. ‘I, god’s servant, who take here my bread and life and sweep the temple, still I swear I would save you’ ‘‘Birds or spirits’ – ‘Songs of Helios’."
Dirt Cakes,"My Grandmother’s body lives
under an ash tree
on an old church ground,
her spirit can be seen making
a maple tree’s shadow jealous.
 
The church’s bricks absorb
the choir’s songs, they flake Holy Ghost,
If Trouble Don’t Come Today.
 
I visit, fall on my knees,
ask her how she doing?
How long is her hair now?
 
Does she still like it braided
in front? Still like having
her scalp scratched?
What y’all doing
in heaven today?
 
She’d tell my mama
don’t let a bird get the hair that falls
out your head, they’ll use it to build a nest
and you’ll never leave Rolesville. Dirt
 
is the only thing I know that can’t die,
it makes sense
we would bury here, makes sense
mama don’t want me playing in it.

Gin River,"If the Neuse River was gin
we would’ve drunk to its bottom,
its two-million-year-old currents,
shad, sunfish, redhorse, yellow lance,
All the blood from the Tuscarora War. 
We would have drunk it all,
aunts and uncles would have led us in Big Bill Broonzy’s 
“When I Been Drinking,”
until everything inside us began to dance 
and we all joined in,
silt around our ankles,
everyone kicking sand.

Odysseus at the Mast,"They lashed him halfway up the mast
And he screamed above the silent oarsmen
As they rowed him relentlessly away
From the bone-cluttered island shore of the Sirens
Sitting in the flowers singing unearthly promise.
            They saw the ship go by,
            and the madman raving there.
            One of them stood up,
            still singing, and made gestures
            with her aching body, using
            hands between thighs, showing
            as well as singing.
            The ship went on by wind and oars.
            The voices faded.
            They shrugged, sucked their sharp teeth,
            and went back to their flowers.
His anxious men, blessed with the silence
Of the blind, saw only the soundless agony
As he fought the bonds of the rigid mast
For the vision the Sirens never dreamed
In a word that faded for ever as he moved
Through life after life in the ship at the mast
And his screaming for release, ceased.
They lowered him down among their flesh
And he mastered again his own flesh and his ship
And remembered, once, an impotent whim for mutiny.","They lashed him halfway up the mast and he screamed above the silent oarsmen. They lowered him down among their flesh and he mastered again his own flesh and his ship. He remembered, once, an impotent whim for mutiny."
No Ghost Abandoned,"We still celebrate
my Grandmother’s birthday
by frying a slab of fish,
smothering flounder
in Texas Pete,
chicken in Sweet Baby Ray’s,
someone puts on Marvin,
someone says I love you.
How can we lift enough
smoke to reach you?
Our cookout has the blues,
I can’t tell you why
I walk old country roads
looking for your spirit.
I hear you speaking
near the river,
where the water
slows against rocks.
My mother says
the best thing to do
is get addicted to God.
But I write from inside my body,
what’s the price of being
obsessed with the dead?
No ghost abandoned,
you mostly
speak of wind.
Someone put on Marvin,
someone say I love you.
In my purple bedroom,
I’ve heard a woman
long dead speak of gardens,
tomatoes, squash,
white tobacco flowers, lilies
are pretty, but they are weeds.
By the elementary school
we used to pick sweet potatoes,
played games like
that’s my car,
that’s my house.
The lands murmurs
in our hands,
where to grow
the biggest melons,
the place where June Bug
finally died,
what’s so sweet
must be sacred.
We mended the horses
rubbed an old mane
until it was time,
you prepare
an old man for death
by reminding him
of his legs, of his work,
I can still see your silhouette
in the window like a kiss
to a father long gone.
In the kitchen where
I haven’t stepped-in today,
I can hear you
among the spoons
and butter knives
in the drawer.
What do you think
when you see my loneliness?
Living ghost? I must learn
the language of rain
to speak to plants
and the Genesis of how seed
turns to flower.

"January 16, 1967: 5:30 P.M.","so that you will know where the sun was
     . Too cold to look up but going downhill
home, I saw the pink contrail, so high
it began the length of my thumb behind
     the silver nail, going somewhere northwest,
just going, like one of the kids running down the street
streaming long crepe paper behind just to keep
     it in the air. “Beautiful,” I said,
committing myself, thinking about the
cold up there surrounding the pilot
     in the cockpit, comforted by warm
instruments and dialfaces. Then, more than
I could bear, another, coming from where
     the first was going, their flight patterns
giving them all the margin of safety
from fingertip to elbow they passed––
     the ductile, malleable cold making
pink parallel bars that showed how pilots
go from where to when, and why horizons
     lose their distance between the points of going.
Forced into a judgment this time, I saw
that it was good and let them go wherever
     they were going, let the sun go down,
and turned the corner home to my own warm faces, and rested.","The pink contrail was so high it began the length of my thumb behind the silver nail, going somewhere northwest. “Beautiful,” I said, thinking about the cold up there surrounding the pilot."
Aloft,"I drove East Genesee Street to West Genesee Street
while the sun was setting––the cold winter sun
slowly withdrawing from the walls
of black snow.
I was not driving anywhere in particular, just driving––
and I remembered what Sam once said
about never having been on his way anywhere,
but simply on his way.
And I thought of a dream I’d had
in which I dreamt that I was dreaming––
in which I was also driving
past stolen goods: TVs and stereo equipment
left on the side of the expressway exit ramp
to kiss the immaterial in the night.
Once, years ago, I was suddenly lost
below a huge overcast sky and driving past rows
of anonymous houses
some still with their long leftover Christmas lights
and identical white mailboxes––
and in passing, I glimpsed
a man running up his driveway with two garbage cans
––one in each hand––
He wore a black pinstriped suit.
The garbage cans were his wings, his galvanized steel wings.","I was not driving anywhere in particular, just driving. I remembered what Sam once said about never having been on his way anywhere. I glimpsed a man running up his driveway with two garbage cans. He wore a black pinstriped suit."
If There Is Another World,"If there is another world,
I think you can take a cab there––
or ride your old bicycle
down Junction Blvd.
past the Paris Suites Hotel
with the Eiffel Tower on the roof
and past the blooming Magnolia and on––
to the corner of 168th Street.
And if you’re inclined to,
you can turn left there
and yield to the blind
as the sign urges us––
especially since it is a state law.
Especially since there is a kind of moth
here on the earth
that feeds only on the tears of horses.
Sooner or later we will all cry
from inside our hearts.
Sooner or later even the concrete
will crumble and cry in silence
along with all the lost road signs.
Two days ago 300 televisions
washed up on a beach in Shiomachi, Japan,
after having fallen off a ship in a storm.
They looked like so many
oversized horseshoe crabs
with their screens turned down to the sand.
And if you’re inclined to, you can continue
in the weightless seesaw of the light
through a few more intersections
where people inside their cars
pass you by in space
and where you pass by them,
each car another thought––only heavier.","If there is another world, I think you can take a cab there, or ride your old bicycle down Junction Blvd., past the Eiffel Tower and the Magnolia. If you’re inclined to, you can turn left there and yield to the blind, especially since it is a state law."

Poetry,"There’s no sense
in telling you my particular
troubles. You have yours too.
Is there value
in comparing notes?
Unlike Williams writing
poems on prescription pads
between patients, I have
no prescriptions for you.
I’m more interested
in the particular
nature and tenor of the energy
of our trouble. Maybe
that’s not enough for you.
Sometimes I stick in
some music. I’m capable
of hallucination
so there’s nothing wrong
with my images. As for me,
I’m not looking for wisdom.
The wise don’t often write
wisely, do they? The danger
is in teetering into platitudes.
Maybe Keats was preternaturally
wise but what he gave us
was beauty, whatever that is,
and truth, synonymous, he wrote,
with beauty, and not the same
as wisdom. Maybe truth
is the raw material of wisdom
before it has been conformed
by ego, fear, and time,
like a shot
of whiskey without
embellishment, or truth lays bare
the broken bone and wisdom
scurries in, wanting
to cover and justify it. It’s really
kind of a nasty
enterprise. Who wants anyone
else’s hands on their pain?
And I’d rather be arrested
than advised, even on my
taxes. So what
can poetry be now? Dangerous
to approach such a question,
and difficult to find the will to care.
But we must not languish, soldiers,
(according to the wise,)
we must go so far as to invent
new mechanisms of caring.
Maybe truth, yes, delivered
with clarity. The tone is up
to you. Truth, unabridged,
has become in itself a strange
and beautiful thing.
Truth may involve a degree
of seeing through time.
Even developing a relationship
with a thing before writing,
whether a bird
or an idea about birds, it doesn’t
matter. But please not only
a picture of a bird. Err
on the side of humility, though
humility can be declarative.
It does not submit. It can even appear
audacious. It takes mettle
to propose truth
and pretend it is generalizable.
Truth should sting, in its way,
like a major bee, not a sweat bee.
It may target the reader like an arrow,
or be swallowable, a watermelon
seed we feared as children
would take up residency in our guts
and grow unabated and change us
forever into something viny
and prolific and terrible.
As for beauty, a problematic word,
one to be side-eyed lest it turn you
to stone or salt,
it is not something to work on
but a biproduct, at times,
of the process of our making.
Beauty comes or it doesn’t, as do
its equally compelling counterparts,
inelegance and vileness.
This we learned from Baudelaire,
Flaubert, Rimbaud, Genet, male poets
of the lavishly grotesque.
You’ve seen those living rooms,
the red velvet walls and lampshades
fringed gold, cat hair thick
on the couches,
and you have been weirdly
compelled, even cushioned,
by them. Either way,
please don’t tell me flowers
are beautiful and blood clots
are ugly. These things I know,
or I know this is how
flowers and blood clots
are assessed by those content
with stale orthodoxies.
Maybe there is such a thing
as the beauty of drawing near.
Near, nearer, all the way
to the bedside of the dying
world. To sit in witness,
without platitudes, no matter
the distortions of the death throes,
no matter the awful music
of the rattle. Close, closer,
to that sheeted edge.
From this vantage point
poetry can still be beautiful.
It can even be useful, though
never wise.
 ","Poetry is the raw material of wisdom before it has been conformed by ego, fear, and time. Truth, unabridged, has become in itself a strange and beautiful thing. Truth should sting, in its way, like a major bee, not a sweat bee."
Gertrude Stein,"I’d just brushed the dog, there on the dog’s couch.
I was wearing a black—well, to call it a gown is a criminal
overstatement—a black rag. It became clear to me—
and when I say clear I mean the moment went crystal cathedral—
I could see my life from—not a long shot—
but what they used to call an increment apart—a baby step
to the right or left of myself—about the width of a corrective
baby shoe. There I was, broad-shouldered, witch-shaped
without the associated magic—with my dog in my shack—
once mauve faded to pink—beyond sex or reason—
a numbness had set in—Gertrude Stein, Picasso’s portrait of her—
that above-it-all—or within-it-all—look on—not a face
but the planes that suggest a face—the eyes
aren’t really lined up right or the real eyes are peering
from behind the cut-out shapes of eyes. The couch
had been a sort of—not a gift—but a donation of sorts
from a person with plenty of money. When it was dragged
into my house it was already—stately—but with worn patches
and stains. A trinity of dogs over time had laid claim to it—
three egotists. To brush the dog meant I had to visit it
in its monarchy—and in that visit—that single prismatic
increment—I saw I’d become—maybe all arrive in their own time—
some before dying, some after—a draped artifact—
haystack or headstone rising out of the plains—
and then, with fascination—and a degree
of sadness and even objectivity—I loved—
as I once loved “Tender Buttons”—myself.
 ","I was wearing a black—well, to call it a gown is a criminal                overstatement—a black rag. I’d just brushed the dog, there on the dog’s couch. It became clear to me—and when I say clear I mean the moment went crystal cathedral."
Weeds,"The danger of memory is going
to it for respite. Respite risks
entrapment. Don’t debauch
yourself by living
in some former version of yourself
that was more or less naked. Maybe
it felt better then, but you were
not better. You were smaller, as the rain
gauge must fill to the brim
with its full portion of suffering.
What can memory be in these terrible times?
Only instruction. Not a dwelling.
Or if you must dwell:
The sweet smell of weeds then.
The sweet smell of weeds now.
An endurance. A standoff. A rest.

To never be touched. Oh, a nurse,
a doctor, but never to be touched in that way.
You know what way. Listen.
Hear it. Let’s not tag it with a feeling.
Give me a break. What possible song
would you play when you toss my ashes,
someone once asked me.
There is no song, he said. Don’t
narrativize, Diane. Don’t narrativize Diane.

Curl,"No longer at home in the world
and I imagine
never again at home in the world.
Not in cemeteries or bogs
churning with bullfrogs.
Or outside the old pickle shop.
I once made myself
at home on that street,
and the street after that,
and the boulevard. The avenue.
I don’t need to explain it to you.
It seems wrong
to curl now within the confines
of a poem. You can’t hide
from what you made
inside what you made
or so I’m told.

fine a harbor as the Adriatic, Charles said, before the big storm

kretek-ing,"translated by Pauline Fan
i like to watch your breast heave, the pulse of your green veins
smoldering at the crack of my lips,
your brimming breath speaks passion
bloodrush like the swell of desire in a room
surging higher and higher to my eyes, craving life;
our mouths thirst for milk and wellsprings
our clothes laugh, unashamed, into death throes
oblivious to the day’s disquiet;
you close your eyes, compose your shoulders, offer your neck
and tiny hairs unfurl into games and crosswords,
my nose is doglike, my fingers swarm around you
your smiling breath hoists my clavicle
like a wheel that rises and falls with your sighs
—at last you inhale a whole spirit
with several lives—while your eyes wink in pleasure;
i finger the kretek lit by her body,
as smoke seeps to your sublime realm of solemn jest and becomes a city;
i have touched it, i seize it all on a day like this
on a day you urge me to conquer, a day like this.

Poem About My Life Mattering,"Asked myself this morning—this usual—where is black life found?
Surely not in an atlas given how they cull the size
of the Continent down as carefully managed roach control,
But other nights I hear myself singing down a well and it sounds
a trumpet or at least the mouth of Joseph trying to have a good time,
you know? When the stars decided the fly tanning on Mike Pence’s
picket-fence hair—was that black life? And should I shed myself
of that chitin and decide this black self—and so grow a spine—
who must I show it to? I wouldn’t recommend history either,
But black life died for me to sip high-fructose liquids with less ice:
no matter whose skin I wear I can’t laugh at that. A parallel history
is right next door and the neighbor’s dog keeps barking my name.","The writer asks himself: Where is black life found? The answer is not in an atlas, he says. But other nights he hears himself singing down a well and it sounds like Joseph, he writes."

Fête Gallante,"translated by Richard Aldington

The Morning Star flies from the clouds and the bird cries to the dawn.
Amaryllis, awake! Lead your snowy sheep to pasture while the cold grass glitters with white dew.
To-day I will pasture my goats in a shady valley, for later it will be very hot.
Among those distant hills lies a very great valley cut by a fair stream.
Here there are cold rills and soft pasture and the kind wind engenders many-coloured flowers.
Dear, there I shall be alone, and if you love me, there you will come alone also.

On Reading Allen Ginsberg’s “Homework”,"after an article in the New York Times 
It was in the Financial Section. On page 3, below
the fold. A huge multi-national conglomerate is
praised for an “innovative marketing program”
that washes dirty clothes and linens for free  
after a disaster. This time it’s the tornado
that tore through Joplin, but Loads of Hope
began after Katrina. When I think how hard
and costly it was to wash everything we
didn’t throw away after 9/11, my eyes
well up. To begin with, no water or electricity.
It would be months before new machines
arrived to replace those contaminated by dust.
Everything in closets, dressers, chests had to be
hauled to a distant laundry. The sheer number
of quarters it took, the fear that, no matter
how many wash, rinse and spin cycles, 
our clothes would never be clean enough
to put against skin. Allergic to perfumes
as I became after 9/11, I want to breathe
in the Tide of cleanliness; to be one of the lucky,
leaving our filthy belongings with strangers
to remove what they can of disaster and return
them to us, clean, neatly folded, wrapped 
in paper, bagged, and tied with a ribbon.","After 9/11 it was hard to wash everything we didn’t throw away. Everything in closets, dressers, had to behauled to a distant laundry.

Wild Horses Drink from the River of History,"Hours before dark, I follow the stony path
from the parking lot to the river bank. 
Along the shore I look for crushed branches and trampled grass,
the clearing where wild horses are said to appear.
Then, I hide behind a mesquite tree, hold my breath.
I want to know their secrets.
Finally the mares and foals emerge from the woods
and stand, ankle deep, among the dense reeds.
At once the entire herd bows their heads,
laps the cool water, takes the river into themselves. 
If I were brave, if I’d forget 
to move past the brokenness of my own family,
I’d approach these unclaimed, unnamed creatures.
I’d stroke their brown manes, 
feed them sugar apples and snow peas.
We’d share one fearless story.
Now the Mustangs dig their feet under the tall grass.
I step forward, snap a few pictures,
as if the camera could capture 
when my unsettled heart and theirs became one.
Overhead, the whir of helicopter blades
cuts through a questioning sky.
Suddenly there’s a thousand echoes,
galloping hooves ringing over badlands.
I turn and look back to the river
which flows on, relentlessly, carrying with it
every story of who or what has come and gone.
And the sun sets, dropping behind the mountain,
leaving a blue ridge, a dimming thread of gold.
I get into my car, head up switchbacks
that lead me to the open highway and down towards the city
where lights shimmer like the past of distant stars.","The Mustangs are said to have appeared in a clearing in the Badlands of northern Arizona. The wild horses are unclaimed, unnamed creatures. The herd of mares and foals swim ankle-deep in the river."
Karma,"my heart keeps breaking does not stop breaking
            —Agha Shahid Ali
            What are the chances, Shahid, you will 
yardstick your way out of the wintering ground’s 
pinafore of snow with the identical song 
memory now recites for me, 
like the time our car stuttered to a stop
in the middle of the street, or when those orchids 
bordering the far side of the walk had to be 
wing bones once, the prehistoric gull’s flight before 
consciousness was pegged by man,
before rain shuddered like a crowd’s deafening voice, 
that same pitch loneliness factors from silence, 
or when one’s hands and knees are on the earth 
and sorrow becomes a hundred silver fish heads 
thrown in a market in China. How 
burnt grass in California carried a warning wind 
that still hurts someone’s lungs in upper Canada. . . 
            What, what are the chances a piece of my flesh 
glow-wormed its way into your heart as a single word 
would in the future of someone’s open mouth, or that 
the ones we loved were once the ones we hated, how 
my undoing passion for Moon Jellyfish means the next 
life will be empty freedom and all sex, or opposite:
a taproot set in the garden where 
the impress darkness smells like saffron and blood 
as it retrieves the desert’s mirage water
over and over again, all the while we’re here, 
knowing this loss phrases some god’s gain or damn,
that obsidian wasn’t merely volcanic glass 
but the last jewel set deep in your brain?","Agha Shahid Ali is the author of the novel, ‘My Heart Keep Breaking’ The novel is based on Ali’s experiences as a young man in Pakistan."
The Nightingale to the Workman,"translated by Rose Pastor Stokes and Helena Frank
Fair summer is here, glad summer is here!
O hark! ’tis to you I am singing:
The sun is all gold in a heaven of blue,
The birds in the forest are trilling for you,
The flies ’mid the grasses are winging;
The little brook babbles—its secret is sweet.
The loveliest flowers would circle your feet,—
And you to your work ever clinging! . . .
Come forth! Nature loves you. Come forth! Do not fear!
Fair summer is here, glad summer is here,
Full measure of happiness bringing.
All creatures drink deep; and they pour wine anew
In the old cup of life, and they wonder at you.
Your portion is waiting since summer began;
Then take it, oh, take it, you laboring man! 
’Tis summer today; ay, summer today!
The butterflies light on the flowers.
Delightfully glistens the silvery rain.
The mountains are covered with greenness again.
And perfumed and cool are the bowers.
The sheep frisk about in the flowery vale.
The shepherd and shepherdess pause in the dale.
And these are the holiest hours! . . .
Delay not, delay not, life passes away!
’Tis summer today, sweet summer today!
Come, throttle your wheel’s grinding power! . . .
Your worktime is bitter and endless in length;
And have you not foolishly lavished your strength?
O think not the world is with bitterness rife,
But drink of the wine from the goblet of life.
O, summer is here, sweet summer is here!
I cannot forever be trilling;
I flee on the morrow. Then, you, have a care!
The crow, from the perch I am leaving, the air
With ominous cries will be filling.
O, while I am singing to you from my tree
Of love, and of life, and of joy yet to be.
Arouse you!—O why so unwilling! . . .
The heavens remain not so blue and so clear;—
Now summer is here! Come, summer is here!
Reach out for the joys that are thrilling!
For like you who fade at your wheel, day by day,
Soon all things will fade and be carried away.
Our lives are but moments; and sometimes the cost
Of a moment overlooked is eternity lost.","The poem was written in the first half of the 20th century. It is called ""The Song of Songs"" and was written by Robert Frost. The poem is about the joys of summer and the joy of life."

In Public,"Promise you wont forget

confinement’s theft; no must or sudden blows

of falsehood, hunger and last year","We kept our clothes on despite obvious intentions to take them off. We seldom kissed or even slept. We rode the great divide of falsehood, hunger and last year, hunger."

path upheld as memory’s perennial

Forthcoming,"    to Fernand Léger
I died in loneliness
for no one cared for me enough
to become a woman for them
that was not my only thought
and with a woman
she wanted another one
I died in loneliness
of that I am not afraid
but that I am a clank
upon the gutter, a new guard at twilight
without a dream of adolescence
frustration plucked as strong
I died in loneliness
without friends or money
they were taken off
long ago, a melodrama
sounded out my name, the glass key of a
torch song on Father’s Day
I died in loneliness
away from the beach and speeding cars
back seat in love with Bunny
on the way to Howard Johnson’s
beyond the blue horizon
hunting for a lost popular tune.","Fernand Léger’s poem ‘I died in loneliness’ was written in the 1930s. The poem was written by Fernand Légeger, a French poet. Légar wrote the poem for his friend and fellow poet, Fernando Légers."
Loss,"To live without the one you love
an empty dream never known

Riding down that deserted street
by evening in a lonely cab
     past a blighted theatre
oh god yes, I missed the chance of my life
     when I gasped, when I got up and
        rushed out the room
          away from you.",To live without the one you love is an empty dream never known. To live without your partner is to live without yourself. To be happy is to be happy with someone you love.

II Alone,"Sustained by poetry, fed anew
by its fires to return from madness,
the void does not beckon as it used to.
Littered with syllables, the road does not loom
as a chasm. The hand of strangers on other

does not desert, but looms large
as a dream, a prairie within our dream,

and fell into that pit of the past with no escape.
You knock on the door, and off I go with you
into the night with not even a cent in my pockets,

Act #2,"For Marlene Dietrich
I took love home with me,
we fixed in the night and
sank into a stinging flash.
¼ grain of love
          we had
2 men on a cot, a silk
cover and a green cloth
over the lamp.
        The music was just right.
I blew him like a symphony,
   it floated and
          he took me
down the street and
          left me here.
3 AM. No sign.
          only a moving van
          up Van Ness Avenue.
Foster’s was never like this.
I’ll walk home, up the
         same hills we
             came down.
He’ll never come back,
          there’ll be no horse
              tomorrow nor pot
tonight to smoke till dawn.
He’s gone and taken
my morphine with him

      the night moan yr. name","2 men on a cot, a silk pillow and a green cloth over the lamp. The music was just right. I blew him like a symphony, it floated and floated. For Marlene Dietrich                I took love home with me."
Sonnet VIII,"translated by Viscount Strangford
Mondego! thou, whose waters cold and clear 
Gird those green banks, where fancy fain would stay, 
Fondly to muse on that departed day 
When Hope was kind and Friendship seem’d sincere; 
—Ere I had purchas’d knowledge with a tear.
—Mondego! though I bend my pilgrim way 
To other shores, where other fountains stray,
And other rivers roll their proud career, 
Still—nor shall time, nor grief, nor stars severe, 
Nor widening distance e’er prevail in aught 
To make thee less to this sad bosom dear; 
And Memory oft, by old Affection taught, 
Shall lightly speed upon the plumes of thought, 
To bathe amongst thy waters cold and clear!
    [Doces e claras aguas do Mondego,] 
  Doces e claras aguas do Mondego, 
Doce repouso de minha lembrança, 
Onde a comprida e pérfida esperança 
Longo tempo apoz si me trouxe cego.
De vós me aparto, si; porém não nego, 
Que inda a longa memoria, que me alcança. 
Me não deixa de vós fazer mudança. 
Mas quanto mais me alongo, mais me achego.
Bem poderá a Fortuna este instrumento 
Da alma levar por terra nova e extranha, 
Oíferecido ao mar remoto, ao vento.
Mas a alma, que de cá vos acompanha. 
Nas azas do ligeiro pensamento 
Para vós, aguas, vôa, e em vós se banha.",Viscount Strangford's poem was written in the early 19th century. It was written to commemorate the death of the Viscount of Mondego.
Tasting the Last of the Ice Age,"We stuffed our mouths with snow 
& bark on sleds to the border. 
The ice hotel was not forgot. 
Sleds kept their ice caps on 
& skidded between forest folk— 
they waved, they cried, we saw it all.  
We live in the hotel beyond estrangement. 
It floods sinks swerves—
Ultraviolet auroras on postcards slip
from their raining frames.
The diamond chandeliers
hold prismatic sleepers 
between glass sheets. 
When staircases come down
we lose distinctions.
Still thrilled, yes, thrilling as ever— 
the midnight sun stays on & on.
We do not anyway think of leaving.
Cities nearly all torched.   
Pull-apart bodies stagger
into melting ice. One
drinks from a frozen glass 
then drinks the glass too, 
face at frost removes. 
Flakes ache to re-constellate.
This dawn a pair of lovers, 
were trapped in an ice alcove, caving, 
beneath a smeared Patagonia 
cover, and puffer jacket, p.53? 
Stone told—“look under me.” 
They were already dead.                         
Hardly anyone notices a tender 
chilling bliss. The giant cumulous 
are walk-ons for permanence. 
All the slow night they are there.",We stuffed our mouths with snow & bark on sleds to the border. We live in the hotel beyond estrangement. We do not anyway think of leaving.

Do I want to sleep soundly
Do I want to keep living

Only a single color

Our Quarantine Story,"after Dorothea Grossman
During the pandemic, after he was laid off, it was his idea
to forage for edible weeds around Queens when our food grew scarce.

From the stoop, I would watch him crouched on one knee,
his bare hands between telephone poles,

pulling up green stars from the control joints
under our mailbox full of clover mites & commercial flyers.

I almost forgot how sprawl could be so quiet.

When he returned inside, he rinsed off the stalks,
placed a rolled lot on his tongue and then on mine.

He mentioned how “sticky” foods could be a delicacy
in other cultures, as I turned my back and coughed them out.

And later in the evening, he read to me about how
indigenous women prevented pregnancy by drinking

cleaver tea, as he handed me a tall cup of it swirling with honey.","During the pandemic, after he was laid off, it was his idea to forage for edible weeds around Queens when our food grew scarce. He mentioned how “sticky” foods could be a delicacy in other cultures."
"Oh, I’m Dying, I’m Dying,","                                                          the disembodied voice ribs
in the clip of the snake whirlpooling itself to a fake death.
            Blech, she belches, blepp,
as the faux-bra scrapes, underside-up along the grass, forked
                                                          tongue trailing the coil. Oh,
I’m dead—but we know it’s not. The touch-me-not gapes
            its mouth long enough
to be patted again by the cowgirl who runs one finger a length
                                                          of ventral scales. With shit
it musks itself, sometimes punctures a bleed in its commitment
            to being left alone.
I rewind to the seconds of its resurrection, when it flips to flee,
                                                          and pause to admire its hog-
nose of a snout, upturned and useful, subtle shovel in the plot.","The author watched a clip of a snake whirlpooling itself to a fake death. The snake was revived by a cowgirl, who patted it on the head and ran her finger along its snout."
2020,"Up late scrolling
for distraction, love, hope,
I discovered skew dice.
In the promotional video
you see only a mathematician’s hands,
like the hands of god,
picking up the dice one at a time,
turning them over and over 
before returning them 
to the hard wood table,
where each lands with something 
between a whoosh and silence,
face up, face down,
some faces lying on their side,
as at other archaeological sites.
I bought a set of the patented dice,
each with its own logic and truth 
and aleatory uncertainty—
at home alone I rolled them
across my dining table
to pass the time, 
and time with its own logic
passed. Dear god.
I haven’t been touched in so long.","I bought a set of the patented dice, each with its own logic and truth. At home alone I rolled them across my dining table. Each lands with something between a whoosh and silence."

Disputed Tread,"Where she steps a whir,
Like dust about her feet,
Follows after her
Down the dustless street.
Something struggles there:
The forces that contend
Violently as to where
Her pathway is to end.
Issues, like great hands, grip
And wrestle for her tread;
One would strive to trip,
And one would go ahead.
Conflicting strengths in her 
Grapple to guide her feet,
Raising an unclean whir,
Like dust, upon the street.",The author describes a woman's struggle to find her way down the street. She describes the whir that follows her as she walks. The author also describes the struggle between her strengths and her weaknesses.

Into the question. We turn ourselves against
Its gravity. An axis we defy.

Handed lightning—: bolts, striking.
Who wants to address     America?

Curious and Counting,"How do I get in your atmosphere?
Tell me about your signs, look me planetarily
—those Venuses in your eyes?
There was no thought after you
and I wrote it down. Wandered
to the wailing with my back exposed.
My kind of Sunday, your knees
buffalo and kicking up plains.
We go sockless for beauty.
Ribbons unwind bring us to tied,

all your digits and your lucky number nine.","I’m at your symmetry, remembering                all your digits and your lucky number nine. How do I get in your atmosphere? Tell me about your signs, look me planetarily—those Venuses in your eyes?"
The Inflammation,"The air in the high school is swollen. My heart balloons
as I smooth my name tag down. The woman checking
me in at Austin East Magnet High School has a warning,
“They might not have much to say.”
I have not come to measure their verbs or their vowels.
My vested interest is their red blood cells. East Knoxville,
where six students in one year, from one high school,
are dead by gun violence.
As I walk to Ms. Hall’s young writers class, 16-year-olds
with the mud-red beauty of the Maasai fly past me in the
hall late for class. There are no visible signs of bruising.
A blood test could reveal the damage done these last 400
years. A blood test is a fine modern measurement of the
homocysteine levels moving through precious growing
creative bodies. There are no blood tests in my bag and I
only have one hour to measure what I have traveled here
to know. East Knoxville, fifty years before, every grocery
store, bakery, doctor’s office, barbershop, pharmacy, juke
joint, Miss Lucille Reader of Palms, closed down and laid
to rest on the new Civic Center pyre. Blood sugar levels
bought season tickets to the Moon. Families on the East
side came to know American architecture intimately, how
the right side of Martin Luther King, Jr. Boulevard arced
into the halls of the high school, and the left side dangled
at the front door of Jarnigan & Son Mortuary, oldest Black
business in town. A swelling is how the body begins to heal.
A blood test can be historical marker for the inflammation
of disparity. My ballooning heart enters the door of their
A, B, and O world. I am met by 14 framed faces of curious
encyclopedic sunlight. Their Wolof and Benin mouths follow
me around the room like awakened cicadas. I ask them to read.
They stop buzzing, mid-air, hold their patterns, wondering
if I have come to take something else from them. The one
in perfect white sneakers with BEATS dangling off his ears
keeps his head under his hoodie. The two by the window
use the glass as dream portal, watching, then aiming, their
father’s eyes farther out into the rising Blue Ridge Mountain
light settling the pitched roof of Jarnigan & Son. The room
is a clover field of hide, luck, and chance, but the burning
tenderness of their inflammation wants out. Inflammation
is a fight response from the body when the immune system
leaps into action even when there is no visible injury. Angelina
extends her grey tablet out to me. Her dark Motown eyes
begin their return to Earth. I read her poem as if it belongs
in my mouth. Their words reach and ricochet. My immune
system kicks in just as Jamartray decides I might be worthy,
handing me his fragile worry-filled word rope, his mother’s
Lindy Hop, in and out of the Double-Dutch rope of illness.
Shiasia’s spunky Afro-Latin is read with Black girl attitude
kept under my tongue for moments when the fear in their
eyes is molten and strawberry. She cheers. Leonard begins
with a piercing refusal to never be a statistic and ends with
his mother’s double helix—HeLa—never-ending cells of
extraordinary love alighting every face in the room. It is
9:00 am on a Friday morning in East Knoxville. I have lost
my tally and count. The young poets have broken my fever.","Six students in one year, from one high school, are dead by gun violence in East Knoxville, Tennessee. A blood test could reveal the damage done these last 400 years. The young poets have broken my fever."
I Was Told the Sunlight Was a Cure,"for the cloak of despair thrown over our bright & precious
corners but tell that to the lone bird who did not get the memo
dizzy & shouting into the newly unfamiliar absence of morning
light from atop a sagging branch outside my window—a branch
which, too, was closer to the sky before falling into the chorus
line of winter’s relentless percussion all of us, victims to this flimsy math 
of hours I was told there was a cure for this. I was told the darkness
would surrender its weapons & retreat I know of no devils who evict themselves
to the point of permanence. and still, on the days I want
to be alive the sunlight leaves me stunned like a kiss
from someone who has already twirled away by the time my eyes open 
on the days I want to be alive I tell myself I deserve a marching band
or at least a string section to announce my arrival above
ground for another cluster of hours. if not a string section, at least one
drummer & a loud-voiced singer well versed in what might move me
to dance. what might push my hand through a crowded sidewalk
towards a woman who looks like a woman from my dreams
which means nothing if you dream as I do, everyone a hazy quilt
of features only familiar enough to lead me through a cavern of longing
upon my waking & so I declare on the days I want to be alive I might drag
my drummer & my singer to your doorstep & ask you to dance
yes, you, who also survived the groaning machinery of darkness
you who, despite this, do not want to be perceived in an empire
awash with light in the sinning hours & we will dance
until our joyful heaving flows into breathless crying, the two often pouring
out of the chest’s orchestra at the same tempo, siblings in their arrival & listen,
there will be no horns to in the marching band of my survival.
the preacher says there will be horns at the gates of the apocalypse & I believed even myself
the angel of death as a boy, when I held my lips to a metal mouthpiece & blew out a tune
about autumn & I am pressing your ear to my window & asking if you can hear the deep
moans of the anguished bird & how the wind bends them into what sounds like a child
clumsily pushing air into a trumpet for the first time & there’s the joke:
only a fool believes that the sound at the end of the world would be sweet.",On the days I want to be alive I tell myself I deserve a marching band or at least a string section.

River Roads,"Let the crows go by hawking their caw and caw.
They have been swimming in midnights of coal mines somewhere.
Let ’em hawk their caw and caw.

And the blue has gone to his wings and the red has gone to his head. 
Let his red head drum and drum.
Let the dark pools hold the birds in a looking-glass. 
And if the pool wishes, let it shiver to the blur of many wings, old swimmers from old places.

A Flair for Language,"She wasn’t easy, is a thing we say
about someone we love. My father
says this about his mother. Grandmother’s
words could cut you from the far side
of a room, well into her last years.
The expressions on her face were widely
reported. It wasn’t necessarily the content
of the opinion, although, it was sometimes,
but how it was packaged and delivered
to your door. One might say she had a flair
for language, if it was a Trini ole-talking.
Which is why I had little choice but to laugh,
one of the last times I saw her,
lustrous as velvet in her dark brown flesh,
recalling me, under the glare of early dementia,
as a lovely little darkie, in a more fragile
voice than the one bellowing into my girlhood,
Fatty-Fatty-Boom-Boom. Her smile hanging
off the long vowel, like a cat’s tail, upturned
to the moon. You see; it’s a miracle I still love
rhyme, the coincidence of language and time.","Grandmother's words could cut you from the far side of a room, well into her last years. One might say she had a flair for language, if it was a Trini ole-talking."

And sparrows unthread nests, bring their young nothing
And shadows best seen inside the pitch of a cave
And three hearts stabbed on a train because of courage
And jacarandas flick cinder and blacken the ground
And the harbor horn is a creature roping hulls to the reefs
And the reefs gleam with chrome and absence
And absence is welcome
The bullet is welcome
The malignant cell is welcome
The gray faces and their merciless tongues are welcome
And a father is reptilian in his regard. And a mother stitches
Her lips like a wound.  And the wound smells of silence and its blaring
And a child lays hands on a mine.  And a man swallows his lies without measure
And a woman is told she is less than him she is less than the bodies left
Behind, less than the unmade, the never-was, the dirt forgotten by the tracks
And I no longer care about the losses. I no longer care if the last 
Bit of bark is stripped from the earth, if the starved possum survives
The road, whether my neighbor coughs blood while she drags off a red
Or the hand turning the knob means me harm. I no longer fear 
The inexorable diagnosis, the oceans rising to such heights
In my dreams they are monstrous but we are all still running 
Towards each other, in this latest hour, refusing to shutter our eyes.","""I no longer care if the last bit of bark is stripped from the earth, if the starved possum survives,"" writes the author.

Night of Telescopes,"I have buried my share and hardly anyone knows.
A house must hold ghosts, writing
Names across funereal woods and windows
Good for viewing the lingering past. 
This night of telescopes fixes the cold
October sky—a Saturn so delicate as if
Sketched by moths holding to nearby stones
For their lives. The sutures of the moon drift
Into sharpness and a hand points to the inevitable screen
Another haunt in this dim garden where voices ride
Across pines and the invisible fountain locked
In the same little song. Here is the Sea of Crisis
And I would recognize its expanse anywhere
Having visited often, even beneath my lids when I disappear
At night to visit with a father who no longer knows me
Or the dead who always do, and glow like the rain or a rose
Finished with the business of becoming. I can’t say the worst 
Because I’ll keep living it. Machine of the mind. Belt 
Of the hunter. I can spot his patient blade from either coast—
The one where I drown the one where I love the one
Where I keep rowing through the blaze and the black.","A house must hold ghosts, writing                Names across funereal woods and windows                Good for viewing the lingering past. I have buried my share and hardly anyone knows. I can't say the worst because I'll keep living it."
Florida Poem,"After summer rains,
marble thumb snails and beetles
blot the window screens 
with pearl and drone. Gardenias swell,
breathing is aquatic and travel
a long drawl from bed to world.
During drought,
the heat becomes a devil
girl with oven-red lips
who wants your brains puddled
in a brass-capped mason jar,
who wants the silver stripped
from your tongue, the evening pulse
between your legs, yes, she wants
everything from you.","During drought, the heat becomes a devil with oven-red lips. After summer rains, snails and beetlesblot the window screens. Gardenias swell, breathing is aquatic."
The Function of a Wing,"They arrive as red masked druids, ghost
The edge of the desolate golf course, sandhill
Cranes poised between the tall grass and oaks
Lathered in moss, a fading, this pocket of homes
Long past afternoons of stickball and smoking grills,
Hearts alert to the rhythm of clouds
Despite how loneliness drifts beside us all.
Each day’s arc is a wing, a wish hurling
Across the sky, and also time, because what is the clock
But a ship of travel we must board upon our first breath?
I have read about a girl who pinned her healing to the making
Of cranes, and how they navigate by starlight, instinct, the ancient
Maps scored inside the lace of their bones. They know how to dance.
They arrive as themselves. A newborn will curl around her mother’s
Temples in peace, a place where no harm will descend
in its poisonous light, its cell-stripping forms,
A place of quiet, and journey that is a kind of returning to love.","Cranes poised between the tall grass and oaks. A place of quiet, and journey that is a kind of returning to love. A newborn will curl around her mother’s."
The Depths of the Grass,"Look, in the early light, 
   Down to the infinite 
   Depths at the deep grass-roots; 
      Where the sun shoots 
In golden veins, as looking through 
   A dear pool one sees it do; 
   Where campion drifts 
Its bladders, iris-brinded, through the rifts 
      Of rising, falling seed
   That the winds lightly scour—
Down to the matted earth where over 
   And over again crow’s-foot and clover
      And pink bindweed
      Dimly, steadily flower.","The poem was written in the early hours of the morning. It is set in a field of grass. The author describes the grass as a ""dear pool one sees"""
Corazón in Fall,"People like my poems better when
They are serious and lament the fading
Vessels in my cornea, the fog of days
How I’ll be the last one left on the deck
At the bottom of one of the great oceans.
They don’t want to read about the cure
And how I will never stop listening
To Robert and his lovely sliced mouth
I don’t care how old I get. Poems are like
Fists or lipstick, why waste them on me
Trudging through the park with my free 
Pandora and infectious truths, songs from before the new
Cool kids were born and endless, in the time of disco naps
Delicious chain smoking, the world and its innumerable fires
Then and now and now. A voice bleeds beneath my ribs
Into the rubber-band palms and baby lawns and empty cans
Crammed into the recycling, its triangle logo reminds me of radio
Active garbage buried at the core. We break. We sing the familiar 
Because it feels soft and always. The numbers rise like souls
Flying into the hole no one can see, and did I tell you my arms
Carry decades of lockets shaped like metal hearts, corazones ready
To click open or shut depending on what I can never tell.
There are so many, all that promise and defeat, coiled around
My brittle turquoise view.","People like my poems better when they are serious and lament the fading, he says. Poems are like fists or lipstick, why waste them on me, he writes."
Monologue of One Whom the Spring Found Unaccompanied,"It happens, at times,
That the route becomes beautiful
The incline gentle and the landscape rich
And on the heavy air the smell of growing things
We think the secret hidden in the land
Or month or year
Or traced upon the chart by which we go,
But do not tinker so with subtleties
You brush the secret with your hand,
As the arm swings, striding.
Gone, you’ll know how much more real her absence is
With sound of her that’s missing now in every sound
With walk of her that’s missing now in every passer-by
Who speaks incessantly
Speaks of how the buds unfold
Of how these days the twigs are fat
Of how all things begin to bloom
How every god-damned thing begins to bloom.","The route becomes beautiful when the incline gentle and the landscape rich. We think the secret hidden in the land or the chart by which we go, but do not tinker so with subtleties."

[Like the Japanese cherry blossoms wedded to the soil’s palm],"Like the Japanese cherry blossoms wedded to the soil’s palm
planted in front of the train station; or the yellow-black dance
of the tiger swallowtail’s wings as it flees; or the echoes that follow
after I thunder loud against the kitchen cabinets; or the summer fire
hitched to the air we breathe—the chuckle of ash sneaking into our lungs;
or the way your eyes elope when you’ve had enough of my
tit-for-tat-I’m-right-your-wrong song; or wind—always, there is wind—

Fracture,"When the grizzly cubs were caught, collared, and taken away—
relocated they call it—
their mother ran back and forth on the road screaming.
Brutal sound. Torn from her lungs. Her heart,
twisted knot, hot blood rivering
to the twenty-six pounding bones of her feet.
Just weeks before
I watched a bear and her cubs run down a mountain
in the twilight.
So buoyant, they seemed to be tumbling
to the meadow,
to the yarrow root they dug, rocking
to wrest it from the hard ground, fattening for winter.
They were breathing what looked like gladness.
But that other mother . . .
Her massive head raised, desperate to catch their scent.
Each footfall a fracture in the earth’s crust.","Just weeks before, I watched a bear and her cubs run down a mountain in the twilight. They seemed to be tumbling to the meadow, rocking to the yarrow root they dug, fattening for winter. They were breathing what looked like gladness."
You remember the feeling but not what made you feel that way,"We get used to trash along the road 
or don’t even have to get used to it 
but then some kids put their beer cans 
on the tips of small trees trying to come up. 
Little star. Now I know the cancer 
is in my body and always will be. 
Still, we can convince ourselves 
of anything. When Bea wants to play, 
that’s what I do. She gets under the covers 
and pretends to be part of my body. 
We tell her daddy she’s gone, 
but she’s right there. I say 
this is just me.","Cancer is in my body and always will be, he says. Bea pretends to be part of my body when she wants to play. We tell her daddy she’s gone,  but she's right there."
Sun to Void,"I cannot help my gaze
and did not choose this.
I was a flurry of atoms.
I was a disassembled spark.
I desired impression.
I desired progeny.
Then the Lord said unto me:
Suppose a daughter.
Does it please you?
Immensely. Immeasurably.
But I was not myself a daughter,
could be no mother of one or three.
So I was given all daughters.
All blooms, all fruits.
At first, I was a lamp
craned above a clovered garden.
The roots, they suckled the dirt,
and lashed it, and crawled for eons.
Then they were standing upright
all over the earth.
My gaze horizoned.
My origination fogged.
My eyes searched forever,
my gaze compassing.
I asked God to turn me a way,
give me eyelids, give me veil.
Give me some cover, like every other.
God, please. Please ease me, God
until God grew weary of my weary
and fixed for me an axis.
God said: Wait. Repeated: Wait.
I gave you daughters on daughters.
Are you not pleased?
I do not know pleasure.
I know not what I become.
God said: Your touch
is incomprehensible.
Now you know Me.
No fathom between us.
All men turn their faces to you,
but verily, they turn a way.
They tarry home.","At first, I was a lamp                craned above a clovered garden. Then they were standing upright                all over the earth. I cannot help my gaze                and did not choose this."
Summer Wind,"It is a sultry day; the sun has drunk
The dew that lay upon the morning grass;
There is no rustling in the lofty elm
That canopies my dwelling, and its shade
Scarce cools me. All is silent, save the faint
And interrupted murmur of the bee,
Settling on the sick flowers, and then again
Instantly on the wing. The plants around
Feel the too potent fervors: the tall maize
Rolls up its long green leaves; the clover droops
Its tender foliage, and declines its blooms.
But far in the fierce sunshine tower the hills,
With all their growth of woods, silent and stern,
As if the scorching heat and dazzling light
Were but an element they loved. Bright clouds,
Motionless pillars of the brazen heaven—
Their bases on the mountains—their white tops
Shining in the far ether—fire the air
With a reflected radiance, and make turn
The gazer’s eye away. For me, I lie
Languidly in the shade, where the thick turf,
Yet virgin from the kisses of the sun,
Retains some freshness, and I woo the wind
That still delays his coming. Why so slow,
Gentle and voluble spirit of the air?
Oh, come and breathe upon the fainting earth
Coolness and life! Is it that in his caves
He hears me? See, on yonder woody ridge,
The pine is bending his proud top, and now
Among the nearer groves, chestnut and oak
Are tossing their green boughs about. He comes;
Lo, where the grassy meadow runs in waves!
The deep distressful silence of the scene
Breaks up with mingling of unnumbered sounds
And universal motion. He is come,
Shaking a shower of blossoms from the shrubs,
And bearing on their fragrance; and he brings
Music of birds, and rustling of young boughs,
And sound of swaying branches, and the voice
Of distant waterfalls. All the green herbs
Are stirring in his breath; a thousand flowers,
By the road-side and the borders of the brook,
Nod gayly to each other; glossy leaves
Are twinkling in the sun, as if the dew
Were on them yet, and silver waters break
Into small waves and sparkle as he comes.","The author writes of a sultry day in the countryside. The sun has drunk the dew that lay upon the morning grass, and there is no rustling in the lofty elm that canopies his dwelling."
Notes from a Pioneer on a Speck in Space,"Few things that grow here poison us.
Most of the animals are small.
Those big enough to kill us do it in a way
Easy to understand, easy to defend against.
The air, here, is just what the blood needs.
We don’t use helmets or special suits.
The Star, here, doesn’t burn you if you
Stay outside as much as you should.
The worst of our winters is bearable.
Water, both salt and sweet, is everywhere.
The things that live in it are easily gathered.
Mostly, you can eat them raw with safety and pleasure.
Yesterday my wife and I brought back
Shells, driftwood, stones, and other curiosities
Found on the beach of the immense
Fresh-water Sea we live by.
She was all excited by a slender white stone which:
“Exactly fits the hand!”
I couldn’t share her wonder;
Here, almost everything does.","The Star, here, doesn't burn you if you stay outside as much as you should. Few things that grow here poison us. The worst of our winters is bearable."

Reconciliation,"translated by Babette Deutsch and Avrahm Yarmolinsky
(To My Mother)
A great star will fall into my lap. . .
We would hold vigil tonight,
Praying in languages
That are carven like harps.
We would be reconciled tonight—
So fully God overwhelms us.
Our hearts are only children,
Eager for weary-sweet slumber.
And our lips would kiss each other,
Why are you fearful?
Does not your heart border upon mine—
Your blood always dyes my cheeks red.
We would be reconciled tonight,
If we clasp each other, we shall not perish.

Not,"after Adrianne Lenker
I was supposed to be writing you back
I was supposed to be describing my desires
The moment I plugged my ears, not the clouds on the ceiling
How the heat doesn’t burst
Where you sheered the gap with your thighs, a black skirt
A glossy rainbow beetle eating a lanternfly
A wasp displaced from the splintered wood door
How rain flattened the sky
Blank lightning scorching the undone bed
My chest flat with bones which don’t die
Bones, which persist like hair, inanimate, as stones persist
Mostly green indifferent appetites
When the animal god dies it’s spoiled with worms
When anger reaches its iron tongue inside it burns
I used to get off on a small, concentrated sensation
It took years to undo the glue of experience
It’s a big gap for mood
It’s a dark stripe in the darkness
It’s how I remember nothing in particular
Tracks of metal gridding the street
How a body could produce an iron nail if iron in blood assembled
I didn’t think I came but I must have
How angry it made me, the indignity of not touching
The gauzy light on a woman’s face, her idle desires
Compared to the way we fit two hands inside, hungry
How indifferent to particular folds of skin
There was a bottomlessness to the negations
Whatever it was burning gold inside a ring of nots
I, untied, dispensing promise
A commitment of green circling green only
Not what you might think, a hawk in the dead tree
A velvet rope cordoning
Nothing eventful happened so I forgot it
That’s how life moving through space works
Comparing the size of palms, smoothness of thighs
Caught in a loop I knew from history
Not capital, not significant, of a personal nature
A solemn quality of knowledge, what others might call god
Hair collected in an archive versus
Hair drawn in a long strand from one’s crevices
My horoscope says to do the smallest thing possible
The trees say indifferent rattle in the wind
This was life, normal, tidal, I considered it

The Story of Everything,"dad?
yes, my love
where do we come from?
and we come from all of this
this is a story about a time
a time of strange times
what happened during the Big Bang?
what came after our Sun and planets were created?
throughout the first nano nano nano milli centi second of this Universe
that’s when this story takes shape
in the valley of our birth place
and we cried out to the Universe that we were here
that we were here
and we were many
so many
trillions upon trillions upon trillions
so countless and beautiful
every atom of carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, and phosphorous that makes up our bodies was forged in stars
and as the world continued to change
we evolved our ways
we honor the ancestors and the elders
we pass on the knowledge from generation to generation
maybe we go cyborg
incorporating technology into our skin, bones, and brains
if we all had biological Bluetooth, USB, or WiFi, 
i could’ve just beamed this presentation to y’all
it’s hard work up here you know
there will be the pulling and pushing of emotions
there will be laughter, and tears, and everything in between
for all the racism and hatred that the color of our skin has produced through the history of
our humanity, and for all the conflict that exists even till this very day
it all comes down to vitamin D
if we held hands for a moment and listened
we could become the power of love
the power of unity
and the power of understanding
we gathered together as a community in peace
we showed the universe how great we could all be
if we just sat and listened to the music
if you happen to be down to help create a global self-sustaining reality,
imagine the impact we could have
because the moment we perfect this
the moment we get this
we all win
together
game on
because energy is the currency of the universe

and go out there and live it

At Sainte-Marguerite,"The gray tide flows and flounders in the rocks 
Along the crannies up the swollen sand. 
Far out the reefs lie naked—dunes and blocks 
Low in the watery wind. A shaft of land 
Going to sea thins out the western strand. 
It rains, and all along and always gulls 
Career sea-screaming in and weather-glossed. 
It blows here, pushing round the cliff; in lulls 
Within the humid stone a motion lost 
Ekes out the flurried heart-beat of the coast. 
It blows and rains a pale and whirling mist 
This summer morning. I that hither came— 
Was it to pluck this savage from the schist, 
This crazy yellowish bloom without a name, 
With leathern blade and tortured wiry frame? 
Why here alone, away, the forehead pricked 
With dripping salt and fingers damp with brine, 
Before the offal and the derelict 
And where the hungry sea-wolves howl and whine 
Live human hours? now that the columbine 
Stands somewhere shaded near the fields that fall 
Great starry sheaves of the delighted year, 
And globing rosy on the garden wall 
The peach and apricot and soon the pear 
Drip in the teasing hand their sugared tear. 
Inland a little way the summer lies. 
Inland a little and but yesterday 
I saw the weary teams, I heard the cries 
Of sicklemen across the fallen hay, 
And buried in the sunburned stacks I lay 
Tasting the straws and tossing, laughing soft 
Into the sky’s great eyes of gold and blue 
And nodding to the breezy leaves aloft 
Over the harvest’s mellow residue.
But sudden then—then strangely dark it grew. 
How good it is, before the dreary flow 
Of cloud and water, here to lie alone 
And in this desolation to let go 
Down the ravine one with another, down 
Across the surf to linger or to drown 
The loves that none can give and none receive, 
The fearful asking and the small retort, 
The life to dream of and the dream to live! 
Very much more is nothing than a part, 
Nothing at all and darkness in the heart. 
I would my manhood now were like the sea.—
Thou at high-tide, when compassing the land 
Thou find’st the issue short, questioningly 
A moment poised, thy floods then down the strand 
Sink without rancour, sink without command, 
Sink of themselves in peace without despair, 
And turn as still the calm horizon turns, 
Till they repose little by little nowhere 
And the long light unfathomable burns 
Clear from the zenith stars to the sea-ferns. 
Thou art thy Priest, thy Victim and thy God. 
Thy life is bulwarked with a thread of foam, 
And of the sky, the mountains and the sod 
Thou askest nothing, evermore at home. 
In thy own self’s perennial masterdom.",I would my manhood now were like the sea. I would my life be bulwarked with a thread of foam. The loves that none can give and none receive. The life to dream of and the dream to live.

Witness,"I’m convinced that if you could

with sweat & felt the pulsing of the stars, if

hair rise up
on granddaddy’s arm like that, like
offerings to god, when his elbow touched
hers, if you could have seen

Asking About My Mother,"In the small kitchen, the hog’s head weaves
the gamey scent of death throughout the house.
My grandmother scrapes black hair
from the hog’s pink head with the
sharp blade of her butcher knife. I ask
her about my mother;
I always ask her about my mother. I play
paper dolls under a Formica table with
pearls around my neck & pink lipstick
from my mother’s treasure chest.
My grandmother places the head into the tub & i watch
her hands, wait for her to tell me where my mother’s gone.
My grandmother fills the tub with water.
I hate that she always reminds me of all she’s done for
love. Remember. Remember. Hair. Face. Knife.
She lifts the heavy tub & situates the hog upon
the stove covering all the burners & turns on all the eyes","In the small kitchen, the hog’s head weaves                the gamey scent of death throughout the house. I always ask her about my mother. I play with paper dolls under a Formica table with pearls around my neck & pink lipstick."

I guess  black  people  can  write  about  flowers  at   a   time   like   this since   every

it     in     nature     too.      How      seed    turns   to

A Thing That Happened,"“Oh, we had an intruder alert,”
said my fourth grade daughter
when I asked how school was.
She said this
after the usual shoulder shrug and mumble.
My kindergarten daughter sang in, “Yeah,
we did.”
And I keep the car moving forward.
Even though it feels like a bird
just thwapped against a window in my chest
and this car should stop
now.
Over the intercom, the same silver strainers in the ceilings as the school I went to a long
time ago,
a voice will say, “Mr. Snow, please come to the office,”
and what is expected
is that the teacher will sharply walk to the door
and lock it, that every student in the room
will hide, will be unseeable from the block of glass targeted above the doorknob.
My fourth grader
says everyone tried to fit
in the prairie schooner the teacher and her husband built between the two bookcases,
but there wasn’t room so she tried to squeeze herself alone
behind the filing cabinet.
They tell me this
as no big thing.
They tell me this
like it’s line up, single file, quiet down,
hands to yourself, march outside.
They can’t say it
like I do now. They don’t think about it
like it’s a heartbreak
poem,
have no inclination to want to ask the NRA to give one actual moment of silence,
no inclination to know the name of the school secretary in Atlanta who
talked an AK-47 and a gym bag full of bullets
onto the floor, no inclination to think of grade school teachers
laying their bodies over students,
arms out,
lungs pulling in so hard
they could make their backs
as wide

Untitled Poem For Sarah,"Every morning you'd think

The Start,"It probably started
in a whisper, a murmur,
a low tone hardly caught by the papers,
a sticker, a poster,
a brick wall with slogans in fresh, black paint
because
it probably started with a shove,
some bluster, a gunshot,
crushed fingers, it probably started
with a speech that caught the right ears
on an otherwise happy day,
yellow flowers in a wooden stand on the sidewalk,
red apples, radio
trying hard to smooth out the mood,
kid hurrying past, thinking,
God, he’s shouting
about me,
pulls his hat low,
it probably started
with another man
drunk on swagger,
it probably started
with a small crowd
coaxing exciting lies,
it probably started
with a neighborhood’s head bowed
as the drone grows each day

it came
in a quick, monstrous surprise).","It probably started with a whisper, a murmur, a low tone hardly caught by the papers, a sticker, a poster, a brick wall with slogans in fresh, black paint. It probably started                with a speech that caught the right ears on an otherwise happy day."
At The Corner of New Orleans and Frontier - At Disneyland,"Under Old West guitar and Jazz band trumpet,
where the riverboat steam horn blares,
you order a corn dog.
Beignets and étouffée
are down the way, cowboy,
you don’t have to put up with that.
But the sun dips into everybody’s eyes,
strollers full of screams rock by
and you
start searching, at the popcorn cart and in your life,
for something more
than everything
you’ve been settling
for.","Under Old West guitar and Jazz band trumpet, where the riverboat steam horn blares, you order a corn dog. Beignets and étouffée are down the way, cowboy, you don’t have to put up with that."
Camelot,"One summer
he came back
to my mother’s mother’s
house, missing a finger.
He and my grandmother
drank Old Crow for hours,
swiveled in the torn white
vinyl seats in her kitchen,
forearms draping the edge
of her glass-topped table.
I’d asked what happened,
eyeing the empty near his pinkie.
He said while sleep on the tracks
a transit train ran over this hand.
He was able to pull back—mostly—
all except for the ring finger,
which sat under a rail in Metuchen.
My grandmother inched in, offered:
So what, Sonny, you holdin’
whiskey like a man ain’t
lost a damn thing.
He laughed like royalty
at court, head thrown back.
Turned toward me to change
subject, asked if I had a bike.
Said he saw some kids
on Stuyvesant ridingbadass
10-speed name brands.
I declined. He warned best to
want than refuse what’s free.
Told me to expect one,
like other kids, on Christmas.
His eyes seemed clouded, though.
Squinty. He kept blotting his fore-
head with a torn paper towel.
The hand with one finger gone
missing—kept scratching, tugging
at his face, his arms, his legs--
where my grandmother’s cat,
Camelot, rubbed against
my father’s hems revealing
a pair of mismatched socks:
one white with his blood
seeping through the ankle
the other, brown & unclean.","He and his grandmother drank Old Crow for hours in her kitchen. He was able to pull back, mostly, except for the ring finger, which sat under a rail in Metuchen. The hand with one finger gone was missing."
Rose Song,"Plant, above my lifeless heart
   Crimson roses, red as blood.
As if the love, pent there so long
   Were pouring forth its flood.
Then, through them, my heart may tell,
   Its Past of Love and Grief,
And I shall feel them grow from it,
   And know a vague relief.
Through rotting shroud shall feel their roots,
   And unto them myself shall grow,
And when I blossom at her feet,
   She, on that day, shall know!","Crimson roses, red as blood. Plant, above my lifeless heart. The love, pent there so long, were pouring forth its flood. Through them, through them, my heart may tell."
"I Go Back to Myself, April 2014","And every time, I say this is the last time, now
that we know what travel can grift from the body.
She is naked as I am now, but drunk. In bed.
The place dark, the bamboo blinds like split brooms.
A few weeks before, he’d slipped in using his key,
skittered the dog waiting at the top of the stairs,
watered the mums he’d left on the counter,
put away the wine. He doesn’t mention
coming to the room and she can’t remember.
But this night, every courtesy is whittled
to her littlest part, its radical pink, for once,
indistinguishable from everything: darkness;
his shirt; singed mothwings splayed
on the lampshade like pencil shavings;
wet receipts stuck to the bottom of the vase.
Persephone emerged each spring with the inventory
of her kingdom still clinging to her ankles,
and there were whispers that she grew to love
what we never wanted: swollen Easter fruit, 
its uninvited flesh blue as the vein
bisecting the corridor of my inner thigh.
Each time I go back, I want to sit
with the body. I want to say, “One day you’ll fold
into nights devoid of liquor and lose the taste.
Your joints will ache; your body will try to leave
in ways only your ancestors understand.”
I never think to tell him, “Stop”; tell her “Wake up.”
She’s still afraid of other women, endings, and the dead.
And so I leave, but with the door ajar
as if to say, “Beloved, what has happened
to me shouldn’t happen to you. But until
it does, there is nothing I can tell you.”","The writer returns to the house where he first met Persephone. She is naked as she is now, but drunk. He doesn't mention coming to the room and she can’t remember. She’s still afraid of other women, endings, and the dead."
Daytona 500,"Where we’re from, we know ballet as Dale Earnhardt
gliding through the traffic of Daytona; we know dance
as our hands moving across a table of drunk Miller Lites.
This is universal because I say it is. When my mother called
me Kayleb for the first time, I remembered the haunted house
on Clifton Hill, how she was tugged away by a hired actor.
I screamed until they took us out the fire escape. To care
is to call a name. To care is to call your mother’s name,
as your father pulls at her ankles. Dear Ma, you know your
hands were always too blue in the winter, strapping snow
chains onto the Ford Expedition. This is a happy memory
because it’s a memory. It is warmer now. Blame global
warming, blame the divorce. It doesn’t matter. All that
matters is the heat of the sun, and both being here to feel it.","This is universal because I say it is. To care is to call your mother’s name.

The Understudy,"Even in California
all of my friends require touch

It’s true, I am waiting to be in love          
in front of the people I love.       
He says, I’m glad you’re here

that earthquake for a passing train
but what do we do with the stillness                    
when after great change             
nothing moves, but his hand      
sliding a glass of wine
across the table
instructing me to drink              
with a single nod.
I bring the glass to my face                     
but don’t let a drop pass my lips.
Beside him, I am almost somewhere        
I’d like to be for a while.

I tell him I am bad at sex.

I tell him when I’m happy
I go looking for things
I haven’t lost yet.","He says, I’m glad you’re here, and I want to cover his mouth. Even in California, all of my friends require touch, he writes."
Give Me a Boat That Can Carry Two,"See there, the grapes
in the bowl you threw
with your own hands against
the wheel turning anti-clock
wise, at rest on the granite
countertop—first the globes’
gloss will corrode and the air
will spin a fine white cotton
to shroud it into dust—
The quarried stone counter
also marches slowly
to dust. Today, outside
the sky and sea both share
a dark blue-grey stoneware—and this,
this is how you love:
as the crescendo of morning’s bright,
its silver spears, diffused
through a veil, as the kiss
of grape-skin against
lilac glaze, even,
until from the dark
that formed you, you hear
that whisper call you back
to purple wideness, and you return
to the wheel to practice
giving shape to one vessel
that can hold another,
that can feel it pulse
and then slacken.",Grape-skin against lilac glaze is the kiss of grape-skin. The quarried stone counter also marches slowly                to dust.
Cape Cod,"The low sandy beach and the thin scrub pine,
The wide reach of bay and the long sky line,—
           O, I am far from home!
The salt, salt smell of the thick sea air,
And the smooth round stones that the ebbtides wear,—
           When will the good ship come?
The wretched stumps all charred and burned,
And the deep soft rut where the cartwheel turned,—
           Why is the world so old?
The lapping wave, and the broad gray sky
Where the cawing crows and the slow gulls fly,—
           Where are the dead untold?
The thin, slant willows by the flooded bog,
The huge stranded hulk and the floating log,—
           Sorrow with life began!
And among the dark pines, and along the flat shore,
O the wind, and the wind, for evermore!

My Hero,"(To Robert Gould Shaw )
Flushed with the hope of high desire,
    He buckled on his sword,
To dare the rampart ranged with fire,
    Or where the thunder roared;
Into the smoke and flame he went,
    For God’s great cause to die—
A youth of heaven’s element,
    The flower of chivalry.
This was the gallant faith, I trow,
    Of which the sages tell;
On such devotion long ago
    The benediction fell;
And never nobler martyr burned,
    Or braver hero died,
Than he who worldly honor spurned
    To serve the Crucified.
And Lancelot and Sir Bedivere
    May pass beyond the pale,
And wander over moor and mere
    To find the Holy Grail;
But ever yet the prize forsooth
    My hero holds in fee;
And he is Blameless Knight in truth,
    And Galahad to me.",The poet wrote of a young knight who died for God's great cause to die for the cause of chivalry. He was killed in battle in the battle of Ypres in France.
Chaucer,"Gone are the sensuous stars, and manifold,
Clear sunbeams burst upon the front of night;
Ten thousand swords of azure and of gold
Give darkness to the dark and welcome light;
Across the night of ages strike the gleams,
And leading on the gilded host appears
An old man writing in a book of dreams,
And telling tales of lovers for the years;
Still Troilus hears a voice that whispers, Stay;
In Nature’s garden what a mad rout sings!
Let’s hear these motley pilgrims wile away
The tedious hours with stories of old things;
Or might some shining eagle claim
These lowly numbers for the House of Fame!","Gone are the sensuous stars, and manifold men, gone are the vast and manifold stars of the night. Clear sunbeams burst upon the front of night; ten thousand swords of azure and of gold give darkness to the dark and welcome light."
The Negro Soldiers,"These truly are the Brave,
These men who cast aside
Old memories, to walk the blood-stained pave
Of Sacrifice, joining the solemn tide
That moves away, to suffer and to die
For Freedom—when their own is yet denied!
O Pride! O Prejudice! When they pass by,
Hail them, the Brave, for you now crucified!
These truly are the Free,
These souls that grandly rise
Above base dreams of vengeance for their wrongs,
Who march to war with visions in their eyes
Of Peace through Brotherhood, lifting glad songs,
Aforetime, while they front the firing line.
Stand and behold! They take the field today,
Shedding their blood like Him now held divine,
That those who mock might find a better way!","These men who cast aside old memories, to walk the blood-stained pave of Sacrifice, join the solemn tide that moves away, to suffer and to die for Freedom.

The Rubinstein Staccato Etude,"Staccato! Staccato!
Leggier agitato!
    In and out does the melody twist—
Unique proposition
Is this composition.
    (Alas! for the player who hasn’t the wrist!)
Now in the dominant
Theme ringing prominent,
    Bass still repeating its one monotone,
Double notes crying,
Up keyboard go flying,
    The change to the minor comes in like a groan.
Without a cessation
A chaste modulation
    Hastens adown to subdominant key,
Where melody mellow-like
Singing so ’cello-like
    Rises and falls in a wild ecstasy.
Scarce is this finished
When chords all diminished
    Break loose in a patter that comes down like rain;
A pedal-point wonder
Rivaling thunder,
    Now all is mad agitation again.
Like laughter jolly
Begins the finale;
    Again does the ’cello its tones seem to lend
Diminuendo ad molto crescendo.
    Ah! Rubinstein only could make such an end!",The piece was written in the early 20th century. It was composed by the composer Rubinstein. The piece is called ‘The Music of Rubinstein’.
[I seek for rhythmic whisperings],"translated by Babette Deutsch and Avrahm Yarmolinsky
I seek for rhythmic whisperings
Where noises bandy—
For life I listen wistfully
In footless banter.
I cast wide nets and tentative
In lakes of sorrow.
I go toward final tenderness
By pathways sordid.
I look for dewdrops glistering
In falsehood’s gardens.
I save truth’s globules glistening,
From dust-heaps garnered.
I fain would fathom fortitude
Through years of wormwood—
And pierce the mortal fortalice,
Yet live, a worldling.

To bear, untainted;
By tenebrous bleak passages
To joy attaining.","""For life I listen wistfully in footless banter"" ""I cast wide nets and tentative in lakes of sorrow"" ""My cup, through ways impassable, I go toward final tenderness"""
from “Consequences upon Arrival”,"We woke into the morning undressed. Every thought washed of color and their chains rusted over. 
Our certainty absorbed into forms of circulation. Plasma-rich consistencies. Or spittle. It was difficult to make out the occasion. Or to whom we owed the honor. 
No one suffered a wound. Nor suffered without good reason. The occasion filled to capacity our uncharted, elemental mouths.
  //
  The only meaningful thought tore itself from the valley. Meaning thirst increased. Flooded dwellings and crevices of pain. 
The pain that was simple. Fundamental as the air before rain. 
The circumstances formed around our suffering decayed from the point of initiation inward. This so abandonment became common. 
We trained our ears to wake and comprehend the hour. Deliver oxygen. Rest one foot in its light.
  // 
  We rose our heads only to say, fuck learnedness. Behavior that could only exist in the mouth acquired by failure. 
Articulate and reform the needle drawn up into the roof of its suffering. 
We weren’t coming back—not one night we said—to that disease-shaded landscape. That puss in sheep’s clothing though desire was tied to its awning. 
  //
  Difference presented a sense of direction. Non-glorious. Scars that festered when we did not proceed.
What underpinned the context profited in its depletion. In frequent marshes. 
Trust, it’s one true follower. 
  //
  Undressing was performed in accordance with regularity. Its networks regulated and perverse, context required no record. Met us squarely in our eyes. 
The eye that awned. 
The loud immeasurable eye. 
The eye hugging the feet of our failure required collaboration 
that could only be offered between streams. Or given in the rivers that fed themselves.
  //
  We woke with dreams pulled through fine intelligent mesh. 
An intelligence that aged gracefully, like iron. Hardly undone. Such were the overwhelmed conditions upon which our senses depended. The just barely. 
The thorn a fundamental characteristic of our sides.
We saw history was outlined in our ruin of stitches, appearing despite the context that was their given keloid nature. 
What is a vulnerable frontier. It was important to ask of our musculature seizing.
  //
  Language returned through the appearance of clouds. Furtive, deeply shadowed offering nothing. 
We stood adjacent. Looked up and rubbed our arms. 
While not offensive, it’s inappropriate to remain in the procession and offer nothing. Not shade nor rosettes. No part in restoring the fence. Neither the most obvious: rain. 
We should start a committee, someone said. THE COMMITTEE TO END LANGUAGE THAT DOES NOT OFFER RAIN, of which the goals and bylaws were as heart-felt as they were without collective teeth. 
  //
  We woke to vandalization relative to the committee. 
Someones it seemed, were, in their quiet nighttime way, against what they interpreted as the public shaming of non-productive existence. And for the first time in memory, accountability was on the table. It was bulbous and moist. It absorbed all of the blame which was not at all called for. 
It said I have introduced ideological context.
I ruined the stitches. 
I don’t feel seen. 
I’m absorbed by failure. 
I drink from the river and feel nothing. 
My gaze depletes. 
It is me to whom you owe great honor.",The author writes about the pain of living in a language that doesn’t offer rain. He says the language is ‘a vulnerable frontier’ and ‘the thorn a fundamental characteristic of our sides’

that is what i do
not anybody but the one who is the very one who is the one who 
can know I do not forgive the ones who have the same quality for warring

who i want inside me who among my sweet friends
all of whom treat me like the

somebody to pick up the tab for afterschool

“Uvalde Shooting Highlights Role of Doors in Security Plans”,"—AP News headline
The teacher remembers pulling the door
closed. She thought the door
would lock because that door
is always supposed to lock. The door
failed to lock. They say when god closes a door
the shooter will fire through the door’s
windows. At first they said she left the door
open and the shooter got through the door.
She remembers she had opened the door
to carry in supplies, propping the door
open with a rock. But she closed the door
when she heard the shooter just outside the doors.
I ran back into the building. I still had the rock in the door.
So—I opened the door—
kicked the rock—and then locked the door.
Later, they verified she had closed the door
and the door
did not lock. Later, there will be a closed-door
inquiry at the state Capitol. It’s through the closed door
that all the men with guns will enter. The classroom doors
have windows above the knobs. The glass on one door
shatters from gunfire and a man walks through the door-
frame and fires more than 100 rounds. A thin blue door
connects one classroom to another. He shot the door,
a girl in the classroom tells the 911 dispatcher. Through the door
bullets graze two officers and they retreat farther from the door.
No other men with guns will go near the classroom door
for another forty minutes. They said they needed the door’s
key from the janitor. It remains unclear if they tried the door
to see if it was locked. The girl calls again and watches the door
and covers herself in her dead friend’s blood and this is how the door
between heaven and hell cracks open. The door-
way is a thin blue line. The men with guns unlock the door
and shoot the shooter who shoots back from the closet door-
frame. The governor orders all the schools to check their doors
each week and all the doors everywhere come unhinged and every door
is a door is a door is a door is a door

The Sheaves,"Where long the shadows of the wind had rolled,
Green wheat was yielding to the change assigned;
And as by some vast magic undivined
The world was turning slowly into gold.
Like nothing that was ever bought or sold
It waited there, the body and the mind;
And with a mighty meaning of a kind
That tells the more the more it is not told.
So in a land where all days are not fair,
Fair days went on till on another day
A thousand golden sheaves were lying there,
Shining and still, but not for long to stay—
As if a thousand girls with golden hair
Might rise from where they slept and go away.","A thousand golden sheaves were lying there, shining and still, but not for long to stay. Where long the shadows of the wind had rolled, green wheat was yielding to the change assigned."
The Forest for the Trees,"I have seen a tree split in two
from the weight of its opposing branches.
It can survive, though its heart is exposed.
I have seen a country do this too.
I have heard an elder say
that we must be like the willow—
bend not to break.
I have made peace this way.
My neighbors clear-cut their trees,
leaving mine defenseless. The arborist
says they’ll fall in the first strong wind.
Together we stand. I see this now.
I have seen a tree grown around
a bicycle, a street sign, and a chainsaw,
absorbing them like ingredients
in a great melting pot.
When we speak, whether or not
we agree, the trees will turn
the breath of our words
from carbon dioxide into air—
give us new breath
for new words,
new chances to listen,
new chances to be heard.","Trees can survive, though its heart is exposed. I have seen a tree grown around a bicycle, a street sign, and a chainsaw. When we speak, the trees will turn the breath of our words into air."
Words of Encouragement,"“One must always present something
Among the dying” —W.S. Merwin
When writing poems about extinction
it’s important that you make the poems
deep but uplifting.
Nobody wants to read a bummer poem
about endangered orcas and their dead babies.
Keep it light. Keep it motivational. Encouraging.
It’s important to accommodate your gentle reader.
Don’t say anything about how if you won’t swim in it,
why should they live in it.
Don’t say that. Honesty is offensive
in this day and age. It’s always been offensive.
How else do you suppose we got here?
Maybe, instead of saying something like,
“The orca and salmon are going extinct
because of ordinary greed and apathy,”
say something like, “The noble creature
with his power and grace shall journey away
forever through the portals of time.”
Good taste omits mention of
(baby orcas, abducted to be theme-park clowns—
decades in chlorinated cages, taking their eyes—
how during the capture, so many died.)
Don’t forget to forget what you know
about human cruelty—
how the baby orcas that didn’t survive
had their bellies slit and filled with stones,
then were sewn closed
and dumped into the sea,
to sink into a silence so dark and so deep
public outrage couldn’t reach—
a depth unfathomable as a mother’s grief
too heavy to carry for one day, much less 17*.
Among the dying, shall we pretend
that in the end, we too shall not be listed
among the dead? Yes. Let's pretend,
when writing poems about extinction.
  * This detail is referring to the seventeen days that an endangered Southern Resident orca carried the body of her dead calf on her rostrum for more than 1,000 miles in what the media called a “tour of grief.”","When writing poems about extinction, it's important that you make the poems deep but uplifting. “One must always present something                Among the dying” —W.S. Merwin."
(A Poem Is a) Naming Ceremony,"What has grown out of what has gone away?
The clear-cut patch has grown larger on the mountain.
The rivers have grown murky with timber trash,
and there’s enough run-off cow manure to grow corn
out there on the tide flats. I don’t want to think about
what has gone away. I want to meander and play
and forget myself until I can grow a new me
in place of all this grief—learn the language to see
the cotton wood as kwealich ice, the dancing tree;
the killer whales as quell’ lhol mechen, our relatives
under the sea; the whole glorious landscape
filled with meaning to end my grieving.
When I was young, I was invited to learn
Xwilngexw’qen, the people’s language,
but I said no. I didn’t understand. I thought
I wanted to learn how to be rich. I didn’t know
that the only way to posses all the weather
of the world is by naming it—here is bird song,
here is the kiss of a lover, here is the feel
of cold water at the peak of summer.
I have spent my life with words, trying to name
a hint of what I lost by not learning my language.
Estitemsen. Tu totest sen. Estitemsen.*
  * I’m doing my best. I’m still learning. I’m doing my best.","When I was young, I was invited to learnXwilngexw’qen, the people’s language, but I said no.

Tour of a Salmonberry,"A salmonberry is a
luminous spiral,
a golden basket
woven of sunshine,
water, and birdsong.
I’m told that the birds
sing so sweet because
of all the berries they eat,
and that show you
can have a sweet voice too.
In my Native language,
the word for salmonberry
is Alile’. In Sanskrit, Lila means
God plays. Salmonberries
sometimes look that way.
Every year they debut,
spectacular in the landscape,
worthy of their genus name—
Rubus spectabilis, meaning,
red sight worth seeing.
Each drupelet holds a seed
and the shimmering secret
kept by rain—of how to rise,
float above the earth, feel
the sun, and return.","A salmonberry is a shimmering spiral, a golden basket woven of sunshine, water, and birdsong. In Sanskrit, Lila means God plays, and salmonberries sometimes look that way."
Abecedarian for the Dangerous Animals,"All frantic and drunk with new warmth, the bees
buzz and blur the holly bush.
Come see.
Don’t be afraid. Or do, but
everything worth admiring can sting or somber.
Fix your gaze upward and
give bats their due,
holy with quickness and echolocation:
in summer’s bleakest hum, the air
judders and mosquitoes blink out,
knifed into small quick mouths. Yes,
lurking in some unlucky bloodstreams
might be rabies or histoplasmosis, but almost
no one dies and you
owe the bats for your backyard serenity.
Praise the cassowary, its ultraviolet head, its
quills and purposeful claws. Only one
recorded human death, and if a boy
swung at you, wouldn’t you rage back? Or P.
terribilis, golden dart frog maligned by Latin,
underlauded and unsung, enough poison to
vex two elephants into death but ardent
with eggs and froglets, their protection a neon
xyston. And of course,
yes, humans. Remarkable how our
zeal for safety manifests: poison, rifle, vanishment.","Bats are holy, holy with quickness and echolocation. They can sting, but almost no one dies and youowe the bats for your backyard."

How Becoming a Mother is Like Space Travel,"The astronaut told us
he didn’t look out the window
for eight and a half minutes
as the rocket launched him
beyond our atmosphere.
Terrifying things happened—
ground vanished, boosters
exploded, day became
night—and he did not look.
He was focusing,
he said, on his job.
He was up there
a long time. He learned
to sleep suspended. He learned
how the sunrise looks
when you watch it every morning
from the soft dark mouth
of space. Many things,
he told us, were different
than he’d once expected.
There’s no space ice cream,
he said. That’s a big hoax.
His vision blurred.
His body became a study:
blood, appetite, cognitive function.
He took many pictures.
All of them were beautiful.
None of them showed
what it was like to float.
When the astronaut returned
to earth, more tests were run.
Scientists discovered that
seven percent of his genes
had changed in space.
He left the planet
as himself. He came back
as himself, rearranged.","The astronaut said he didn’t look out the window for eight and a half minutes as the rocket launched him beyond our atmosphere. He was focusing, he said, on his job."
Anthropocene Pastoral,"In the beginning, the ending was beautiful.
Early spring everywhere, the trees furred
pink and white, lawns the sharp green
that meant new. The sky so blue it looked
manufactured. Robins. We’d heard
the cherry blossoms wouldn't blossom
this year, but what was one epic blooming
when even the desert was an explosion
of verbena? When bobcats slinked through
primroses. When coyotes slept deep in orange
poppies. One New Year’s Day we woke
to daffodils, wisteria, onion grass wafting
through the open windows. Near the end,
we were eyeletted. We were cottoned.
We were sundressed and barefoot. At least
it’s starting gentle, we said. An absurd comfort,
we knew, a placebo. But we were built like that.
Built to say at least. Built to reach for the heat
of skin on skin even when we were already hot,
built to love the purpling desert in the twilight,
built to marvel over the pink bursting dogwoods,
to hold tight to every pleasure even as we
rocked together toward the graying, even as
we held each other, warmth to warmth,
and said sorry, I'm sorry, I'm so sorry while petals
sifted softly to the ground all around us.","In the beginning, the ending was beautiful. Early spring everywhere, the trees furred                pink and white, lawns the sharp green                that meant new. Near the end, we were eyeletted. We were cottoned."
Where Do You Go from Tonopah?,"Because the Mizpah Hotel has claw foot tubs,
this is where you stop. This place has its own
ghost, a good story about The Lady in Red.
It’s said she was murdered here, discovered
by her husband in the arms of her young love.
She’d have lived to wear her lace and heels
if it hadn't been for the train being late,
her husband missing his connection, stopping
in for a cold drink, seeing her, seeing him
ascend the steep stairs. In Nevada,
it’s always about trains, drinks, connections
missed and made and wholly imagined.
Because, you’re told, Tonopah is for those
with a thirst for adventure, you venture
into the Long Shot Bar, order steaks,
a fine red wine and, arguably, the best
margarita between Reno and Las Vegas,
listen to some old man chat up the young
couple from Henderson who say this is
the farthest north they’ve been, exploring
their new state, transplants from Atlanta.
The old man says this is the real Nevada,
but suggests they also make Elko, Winnemucca,
decent towns he’s fond of, would live in, given...
And because you love books and the beauty
of dust, you’ll spend hours wandering
the dense aisles of Whitney’s Bookshelf,
where paperbacks are a dollar hardbacks, two.
What you’ll take home is a first edition,
hardback, John Gardner's On Moral Fiction.
Inside is a personal inscription, June 1978.
Bob, it says, keep writing in NYC. Thanks
for all your help these two years in Tonopah.
Best of luck. I’ll miss you here. Love Jack.","Because the Mizpah Hotel has claw foot tubs, this is where you stop. Because you love books and the beauty of dust, you’ll spend hours wandering the dense aisles of Whitney’s Bookshelf, where paperbacks are a dollar hardbacks, two."
Address What Matters,"You know you want Marilyn’s dress.
Not the one your mother wanted, not
the rhinestone second-skin she sang his song in—
Happy Birthday, Mr. President—not that dress.
You want the simpler but also sleekly tight
little thing she wore here, in this Nevada town,
the dress she wore while drinking shots at this bar
in Dayton. Cocktail cherries, halter back.
You want this dress because she wore it here
but also because everyone who watched her
learned of her secret special talent,
how she could wield a paddleball 100 times
and never miss a strike. Her hips, egg yolks sliding
around a big bowl, kept time, and so did the men
who loved her, or wanted to. No one, not even
Huston nor Miller, knew she could do this,
could create this moment of pure carnal joy.
The movie was The Misfits, and you watch it
every year because it matters, Marilyn matters,
this bar where you and your third husband
spend long summer hours—it all matters.
Everyone has a story here, and some
remember Marilyn, or say they do.
If you had her dress, you could be fearless,
could show everyone who’s ever doubted
that you have skill, you can shudder air.
You would move with a ferocious heat
like the dry desert dust, which is where,
when you’re done here, you’re headed, no matter what.","You know you want Marilyn’s dress. Not the one your mother wanted, not the rhinestone second-skin she sang his song in. You want the simpler but also sleekly tight thing she wore here, in this Nevada town."
Driving Dad to The Dog Museum,"On cross country road trips, my father sang,
old songs he made us learn at least to hum,
my mother snapping along in the front seat,
their daughter untethered in the back.
He sang Oh, Susanna, he sang There’s a Hole
in the Bucket, dear Liza, dear Liza,
he sang Maybellene (why can’t you be true?),
songs with pet names for all of us.
Today I’ve sprung him from Assisted Living,
a picnic in the park, then the Dog Museum.
I’ll pay to see the Huneck exhibit,
the wood cuts and chairs, admire
the exquisite porcelain Great Dane,
a harlequin. My father’s done well
with his therapy dogs, their soft coats
bring back his days of raising hounds,
a young father, before the suits and ties,
before the suburbs. He loves best the room
which houses the war dogs exhibit,
old Rin Tin Tin and the Yorkie, Smoky.
As we enter the parking lot, circle
for a spot his chair can handle,
he starts to sing, he sings Way Down Yonder
in the Land of Buttons...he sings loudly,
his voice echoes across the lot, reaches
a woman walking her whippet, she’s startled,
the dog turns toward us. My father
ignores the woman, says isn’t that the same dog
your friend had in high school? Wasn’t she the one
who died of a self-inflicted woe?
What happened to her dog? Was he sad, too?
Before I can begin to answer,
my father starts to sing, he sings This Old Man—
knick knack paddywack, give the dog a bone!
This old man came rolling home. By the time
we travel the museum’s ramp, he has sung
all ten verses, and I’m Liza again, mending.","On cross country road trips, my father sang old songs he made us learn at least to hum. He sang Oh, Susanna, he sang There’s a Hole                in the Bucket, dear Liza, dearLiza,                he sang Maybellene (why can’t you be true?)"
Fireworks,"Pink faces—(worlds or flowers or seas or stars),
You all alike are patterned with hot bars
Of coloured light; and falling where I stand,
The sharp and rainbow splinters from the band
Seem fireworks, splinters of the Infinite—
(Glitter of leaves the echoes). And the night
Will weld this dust of bright Infinity
To forms that we may touch and call and see:—
Pink pyramids of faces: tulip-trees
Spilling night perfumes on the terraces.
The music, blond airs waving like a sea
Draws in its vortex of immensity
The new-awakened flower-strange hair and eyes
Of crowds beneath the floating summer skies.
And, ’gainst the silk pavilions of the sea
I watch the people move incessantly
Vibrating, petals blown from flower-hued stars
Beneath the music-fireworks’ waving bars;
So all seems indivisible, at one:
The flow of hair, the flowers, the seas that run,—
A coloured floating music of the night
Through the pavilions of the Infinite.","The music, blond airs waving like a sea, draws in its vortex of immensity. The new-awakened flower-strange hair and eyes beneath the floating summer skies. The flow of hair, the flowers, the seas that run."
Dissent and the Hydra,"“[G]uided by the history and tradition that map the essential components of our Nation’s concept of ordered liberty, we must ask what the Fourteenth Amendment means by the term ‘liberty.’”
—Justice Samuel Alito, leaked draft, Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization
“Early attempts to cope with this vile infection resembled battling the Hydra.”
—Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Shelby County v. Holder
  We turn our collars up against the chill of raw judicial power
The fabulous many-headed snake of the marshes of Lerna
It is said that if one head is smyte, three heads grow
A rancorous national controversy
Of spring-headed Hydras and sea-shouldering Whales
Members of the court split three ways
Gestational age ministers life to this monstrous Hydra
We make a long list of circuit conflicts
To cope with this vile infection
We are a quick child
We expect more from an opinion striking at the heart
Had we as many mouths as Hydra, our answer would stop ’em all
For liberty is a capacious term
A jettisoned framework
An animated hiss and whistling wail
Hydra assailants return every hour
Yet their cuts produce in time a perfect animal
Hubris is a fit word for today’s demolition
Of a deeply rooted right, full of hydras and crocodiles
This scheme of ordered liberty is the Court’s own brainchild
Poison fumes, poisoned blood
In a long constellation
With a few bright stars","“Had we as many mouths as Hydra, our answer would stop ’em all’” “We turn our collars up against the chill of raw judicial power’ “ “The fabulous many-headed snake of the marshes of Lerna’s marshes”"

Saturnine,"for Karen Taylor
We cannot feel microbes in the palms of our hands
or hear nanoseconds—we can see the laser slice wind. But 
how it shaves beards remains mysterious.
This talk of science & biologicals & viral crowns  
make old mean men crawl into bowls of cotton 
waiting to be plucked at some point
by cadaver slaves humming Tin Pan Alley tunes.  
What’s a pandemic
but one more mortality wake up call. Tongue dulled by wine salted
and cabbage stews happily forgotten. Buffed shoes shining, not worn.
No more the perfect Windsor Knot because the definition for knot
has swerved from necks to bandages.
If ever we could color the subatomic particles and smash them up
would they look like a Ken Tisa Quarantine Drawing—how that 
could brighten the feet step by step in August air. The summer
feels like a heavy cough that starts in the chest, lingers
until it exhausts patience and runs up through the throat
out into the embracing air carrying all manner of microbes, some
of which or what could possibly infect a city or laugh pyrotechnic
4 p.m. along with feral snarls and cheap guns shooting, poor man
Falls—
Mercy walks down a different block.","Karen Taylor is the author of the book, ""A Man Walks into a Room"" The book is based on Taylor's experiences in New York City during the summer."

Thirst,"Where broken clouds lay dripping
On the edges of the afternoon
Our footprints littered summer’s beach
Abandoning lying driftwood
Torn pictures old letters and the death-buzz
Of flies against the murderous dunes
Returning was to die of thirst
Or see the sun possessed descend
And dive past wet horizons",The author was inspired by the beach where he and his friends spent their summer holidays. He describes the beach as a place where broken clouds lay dripping and where the sun possessed descend.
Vortex,"As the wind unscatters me
Spindle hurricanes unwind

Blow down the ocean’s fences

Whatever sheaf of breath remains
To edge a word along a wind-left wall.","""As the wind unscatters me                Spindle hurricanes unwind from my horizontal eye                Blow down the ocean’s fences                And approach my wreckless remnant                Bones bedenizened by birds:"
Spider,"translated by The Friend
It’s a massive spider who can’t move;
a colorless spider, whose body—
a head and an abdomen—bleed.
Today I saw her up close. And with what effort
all along her flanks
her innumerable feet stiffened.
I have thought of her invisible eyes
the fatal pilots of the spider.
It’s a spider that trembled stuck
at the edge of a stone;
abdomen to one side,
to the other the head.
With so many feet the poor thing, she still can’t
work herself out. When seeing her,
stunned in some trance,
what grief this traveler gave me today.
An enormous spider who blocks
the abdomen from following the head.
I’ve thought about her eyes,
considered her numerous feet...
What grief this traveler’s given me today.
    La Araña 
  Es una araña enorme que ya no anda;
una araña incolora, cuyo cuerpo,
una cabeza y un abdomen, sangra.
Hoy la he visto de cerca. Y con qué esfuerzo
hacia todos los flancos
sus pies innumerables alargaba.
Y he pensado en sus ojos invisibles,
los pilotos fatales de la araña.
Es una araña que temblaba fija
en un filo de piedra;
el abdomen a un lado,
y al otro la cabeza.
Con tantos pies la pobre, y aún no puede
resolverse. Y, al verla
atónita en tal trance,
hoy me ha dado qué pena esa viajera.
Es una araña enorme, a quien impide
el abdomen seguir a la cabeza.
Y he pensado en sus ojos
y en sus pies numerosos...
¡Y me ha dado qué pena esa viajera!","An enormous spider blocks the abdomen from following the head. With so many feet the poor thing, she still can’twork herself out. When seeing her, I wasstunned in some trance."
Gitanjali 60,"On the seashore of endless worlds children meet. The infinite sky is motionless overhead and the restless water is boisterous. On the seashore of endless worlds the children meet with shouts and dances.
They build their houses with sand, and they play with empty shells. With withered leaves they weave their boats and smilingly float them on the vast deep. Children have their play on the seashore of worlds.
They know not how to swim, they know not how to cast nets. Pearl-fishers dive for pearls, merchants sail in their ships, while children gather pebbles and scatter them again. They seek not for hidden treasures, they know not how to cast nets.
The sea surges up with laughter, and pale gleams the smile of the sea-beach. Death-dealing waves sing meaningless ballads to the children, even like a mother while rocking her baby’s cradle. The sea plays with children, and pale gleams the smile of the sea-beach.
On the seashore of endless worlds children meet. Tempest roams in the pathless sky, ships are wrecked in the trackless water, death is abroad and children play. On the seashore of endless worlds is the great meeting of children.",On the seashore of endless worlds the children meet with shouts and dances.

Virgin, adjective, composed of or consisting of virgins. It takes until definition six to ungender it: a person of either sex in a state of chastity. Virgin bush: not under cultivation. Virgin voyage: first attempt, initial foray. A suite of lexemes, including virga, a strip of wood, and vireo—green, flourishing, or fresh. Split at the root: she is fresh. She is new and unspoiled. She is insubordinate, impertinent, rude. Virgin, when said of wool: not yet, or only once, spun or woven. Said of olive oil: first press. Said of metal: made from ore by smelting. Said of clay: not yet fired.","A Virgin Mary is just a glass of tomato juice.

N 49° 43´ / W 53° 53´,"Just off Joe Batt’s Arm. Nadia’s on the bridge, and you bring her the new calculations. Narrow nightwatch nigh the ship’s head while she tossed close to cliffs. She gestures for you to sit, tells you things—drugs they can grow, remedies, interactions, techniques. There are more men than women of working age on board. While she talks, she oversees the change of watch, the steady steps along the catwalks and up to the crow’s nests, the gray-clad backs bent over their tasks. The northern sea has begun to roll with more surge and menace, and a layer of chill under the mist clings to the mouth and nose, undercold. No icebergs to worry about anymore. She tells you that the continental currents are uncertain, as are the depths. Crispin has another bellyache. Some crew sweeps up a grainy spill on the deck below, and she stops to write a note. She looks up as if she has news and explains that the females of only two species undergo menopause. That is, the females of only two species outlive their capacity to reproduce: humans and killer whales. Experience in cessation: the females stop having young, then they lead the pod, carry knowledge of navigation, food supplies, routes.","There are more men than women of working age on board.

Economies of Scale,"You’ll get used to it, Val. Count containers 
to find your way back, because nouns can be 
mass or count, and some can be either—
sin, a sin, crime, a crime, death, a death. 
Windward, leeward, athwart, abaft—nouns 
occur in all environments, above or below 
the waterline or Plimsoll mark, the depth 
to which a ship can be safely loaded in a given 
season or locale. Count the sons up to three—
turns out their names are Stu, Howie, and Jason—
count 67 souls on board: original crew, youth,
merchant marines, engineers, a few tunnel guys 
from the Port Authority, fishers, builders, 
craftspeople, pilgrims: Roy’s their man who 
had keys to warehouses—bullets, millet, rice,
protein powder, beef jerky, canola oil, nails. 
Once you could call it a bareboat charter, 
Post-Panamax with hydraulic rams and gantry 
cranes, a quarter mile bow to stern, powered 
by bunker fuel: what part of speech is somehow? 
This ship’s been through Suez, Guangzhou, 
Singapore, Durban, Le Havre, Shanghai, flying 
its flag of convenience for rent. In the heyday 
of intermodal freight up to 10,000 containers 
a year slid overboard in storms: a hundred gross 
Tri-Metal Ancient Healing Power Bangles, 
3000 Pac-Man ponchos on the sea floor. 
The engine thrums through every pore, judders 
the soles of your feet to the roots of your hair.
Step out for some air—containerization 
divides the risk and limits the loss—auto-
motive to tilapia to zucchini, bay to bay, 
tier to tier, starboard to port, let’s say 
I love you a bushel and a peck: proportionate 
savings in shipping cost are gained by 
an increased level of production. Go on—
the gangway has 88 steps, like a piano, 
and they drove school buses into the hold 
in the dark, fitted them with bunks. Firms 
cannot realize economies of scale in perpetuity.
You do what you have to do. Make rooms 
in it and coat it with pitch inside and out.","The ship is a bareboat charter, a quarter mile bow to stern, powered by bunker fuel.

Ripples,"I trace back the paths that I’ve chosen to take
Only to realize they were not choices,
Just ripples on a lake
Originating from a single cast stone
That was a stupid mistake made on a lonely walk home
And I am sewn together, stitched in a womb
And outward these timeless ripples bloom
Across the lake of my existence
So persistent that my life is an accumulation of choices
Yet I look to these ripples and perceive their voices
Recollections of a mother hell bent on a will
Recollections of a daughter choosing to not fill
The shoes of a misfit mother
I uncover,
I reveal decades of ill given advice
Which was equally ill received
And try to trace back that dreaded stone that I perceive to
Have started it all
Started the cascade of a daughter’s fall
Because the cause is still unknown
Three generations of women unsown,
Related but unknown to each other
I am desperate to escape the ripples of my mother
Just as desperate as she is to escape the ripples of her own
Fighting the ripples that engulf my daily life
To escape the strife that always seems to belong
I wait for the ripples to someday slow, to fan out and release
Me from this curse
But those never-ending ripples seems to grow stronger daily
Instead of just disperse
They engulf me, shroud me, whip me from side to side
I submerge beneath them to where the truth hides
These ripples are the only thing that’s holding us together
So for now at least I’ll pretend to not know better
And go with the flow of the ripples","I trace back the paths that I’ve chosen to take.Only to realize they were not choices, just ripples on a lake.Originating from a single cast stone.That was a stupid mistake made on a lonely walk home."
Hope 2020,"I tried to write about hope
But wasn’t sure I had the audacity
The pandemic took a toll
And our last president was a fascist
He
Said he did more for Christianity
Than Jesus
And between the BLM protest and right wing hatred we just
Stayed inside and tried to live
Contemplating if loans would be forgiven
To provide a little relief
We were safe at home but had to march in the streets
To beats
Of Black Lives Matter
See I was flattered
To be part of the Healthcare Hero’s
Until I start telling the truth and the death toll added zeros
And zeros
Until the number reached 100000
And still people believed it was a hoax
And wouldn’t wear masks in public places
The deck was stacked against us and the government held
Aces
But they underbid as the death toll continued to rise
But as the number grew there were fewer tears from eyes
Of the privileged
Because big business needed that money
Propaganda had normal people acting funny
Yet still I dared to hope
Until I couldn't breathe as
George Floyd choked and his killer walked the streets free
See
We're going back into summer
But instead of George Floyd the name we will march to is
Daunte Wright
And we again will wear our masks as we continue to fight
Systems of oppression
The National Guards were called and wore bullet proof vest
When we said Black Lives Matter
But were nowhere to be seen when the right wing
Unhinged the government’s seat of power
And the hours
Continued to tick on
525600 deaths but rent wasn’t on
But Nurses were on
The verge of a mental break down every day
Saving lives of the people who claimed don’t tread on me
And yet I say I’m going to write about hope
As a black woman in America it’s impossible not to choke
On the repetitious contradictions
Vaccines vs quarantine things while the seams are bursting
On the national debt
“Make 600 dollars enough” because it’s all you gone get
As you try to survive this crisis
Going hungry while giving the nation its slice is
Your patriotic duty
I’m a poet and I know it sounds looney
That I can’t write about hope
2020 had me riding a high worse than dope
And when I came down it was comparative to death
Knowing that nothing would change
So I inhale and deep breath
And continue to think about hope",The pandemic took a toll and our last president was a fascist. Between the BLM protest and right wing hatred we just stayed inside and tried to live.

Fragile,"I remind myself that I am not fragile
People will not tiptoe around me
My blackness is on full display
To complement my femininity
I attempted to understand you
I put my heart and mind in your shoes
And now it is pounding out of sync
To the rhythm of my blues
I am not supposed to be fragile
I am not expected to cry
But instead to throw back my shoulders
And hold my head up high
I am not considered fragile
I am the epitome of strength
Careful to not show my emotions
Careful to disregard the length
Of my pain, expected to be perfect
You seldom allowed the privilege of a mistake
I did it all in the right order
You never wondered if it made my mind break
Split my consciousness in two
The black, the female, in addition to
The wife and the mother,
The nurse, the friend,
The sister to a brother
And each title adds a brick to my back
Just as I attempt to swim
I am unable to be fragile
Even though my patience is wearing thin
Of being expected to get over the past
Expected to hide my pain
I pray that if I am reincarnated
Lord please don’t make me a Black woman again
Because I desperately NEED to be FRAGILE
To be handled with tenderness and love
To have my very soul caressed
And be praised as I am capable of
Such amazing and beautiful things
I need to be able to fully experience my pain
Instead of brushing it aside and acting
Like everything is okay
White girls want to be fragile like bombs
Not fragile like the flowers
Black girls aren’t even given the choice
Because our feelings simply don’t matter
We are and were never expected to be fragile",I remind myself that I am not fragile. People will not tiptoe around me. I am the epitome of strength. I desperately NEED to be FRAGILE.
Martyr,"I don’t want to be a martyr
But I see you calling for my help
Confusion beyond words
I try not to gasp at the wrong conclusions
Cry at our government in rage
Attempt to stay positive on my Facebook page
Because I cannot be a martyr
Although I was trained to be your saving grace
I’ve held hands with the dying
Looked their families in the face
When I say “they’re gone”
Assure them you didn’t suffer
I dare not be your martyr
My youngest would barely utter
Memories of us if the worst were to pass
I’m home praying for help
But my faith won’t last
Because I know I can help you
I know I can give you 4 weeks
I know I’m being arrogant
But in my arrogance at least
I want to help
Powerless is one thing most nurses say they felt
But there are simply no words for this
I’m in my small town living life in bliss
While my counterpart is comforting the dying
Risking her life daily trying
Because she don’t give a damn about being a martyr
This guilty privilege I choose to bear
Sending prayers out to those who will stare
At the face of a stranger as they take their last breath
I’m not a martyr
Therefore I guess I will just sit here and wonder
What I could have done","I don’t want to be a martyr, but I see you calling for my help. I’ve held hands with the dying and looked their families in the face. I know I can give you 4 weeks, but in my arrogance at least I want to help."

                                          And it all goes dark
                    And the engine starts
            And the vibrations shake
                Everything that was not tied down properly
Gets jostled
                            As the weight shifts
When the truck leaves
                And some things fall
                        With every turn            And heirlooms break
                That we have held onto                            Because we were supposed to
                    We do not stop moving
            Because we know
            that when we get
            to the new house
            it will be bigger
                    and better
            and more beautiful
            with no cracks in the foundation
            and enough room for everyone
            to sleep peacefully.
        ","In the back of the moving truck in the middle of the night, the driver slams the door of the truck shut and the vibrations shake the truck. Everything that was not tied down properly is jostled and heirlooms break. We know that when we get to the new house, it will be bigger and more beautiful."
"Seed of Mango, Seed of Maize","I saw one of the grandmothers only once
in a photograph.
Short and sturdy she was, a black black Carib
with a forehead wide as the sea
that kisses Port Elizabeth
and a nose broad as the nostrum of Admiralty Bay.
Breathing deeply,
her breath was fume of coconut and allspice,
mango and frangipani,
blackbird and blue sky,
was the isle of Bequia.
She conjured a daughter,
then jinxed another,
and they bedeviled five daughters between them,
and I am one of those flying fish.
The other grandmother I composed from myth
and half-told stories.
She was a red red Cheyenne—
scorched earth,
much chased—
sported a thick reed of brain
pulled off from her forehead,
wide as Dakota
before it was north and south.
She hisses warnings across ten, then ten times
ten more years to a son
who reshapes them for me
in my dreams, sometimes in my waking.
As flute, blue maize, dance of the sun, she comes, crow on the wing, singing up the ghosts,
and I am one of those—a ghost, singing.","I saw one of the grandmothers only once                in a photograph. She conjured a daughter, then jinxed another, and they bedeviled five daughters between them. She was a red red Cheyenne, with a thick reed of brainpulled off from her forehead."
Langston Won’t Stay In His Grave,"calls me rose of neon darkness, calls him-
self early blue evening, black smoke of
sound. Says we are related, you and I,
reminds me we are wandering in the dusk,
our faces a chocolate bar, facing the night
of two moons. And though I’m a lonely little
question mark, he laughs. Life is for the living
with gypsies and sailors. `Til the old junk man
Death plants your toes in the cool swamp mud,
shake your brown feet, honey. Wander through
this living world—get out the lunch box of your
dreams. Stay awake all night with loving or be
a woman in the doorway. Death don’t ring no
doorbells or say here is that sleeping place as if
it were some noble thing. Think how thin and
sharp the moon is tonight. Don’t mind dyin’,
veiling what darkness hides. Haunt like mystery,
like a naked bone in gumbo. Nod at the sun.","Life is for the living with gypsies and sailors, he writes. Death don’t ring no doorbells or say here is that sleeping place as if it were some noble thing. Haunt like mystery, like a naked bone in gumbo."
I Never Felt Comfortable in My Own Skin So I Made a New One,"I was on a walk when I was struck by the precarity of the gender that wore me,
which moved my matter, wrote books, and fell in love. as a child, I scoured 
the forest for brittle cicada skins abandoned on trees. husks present differently now
a pair of nylons caught in the thicket, a beak surviving its decomposing bird, 
a mural of George Floyd with a purple cock spray-painted on his beryl cheek.
among these discreet mutilations, I pull a line of thought through flesh 
where a misled margin slept. I was uninhabitable before I snared a man
for his hide. I was not unlike the skin of a drum thriving under a stamina 
that made music of me before I split. you wouldn’t recognize me now
if you saw me in the trees, played out, scattered to the undergrowth. I took a life 
and returned it to scale and membrane. I foraged a life coated in plastic
and mud from the highway overpass. it reeked of wheatpiss and it was mine.","As a child, I scoured  the forest for brittle cicada skins abandoned on trees.

from “Consequences of a Heavy Heart”,"The whole time you’ve been writing and thinking ocean because it is unknown, because it’s your life. Because you have the brightest terror, like following a white feather into the street. You want it so badly. Would you call that desire? Would you call it love? When you can’t see your legs because of the dark. But did you want to see what was happening? Every life form skidded by. The human products bobbing and sinking. Was that seaweed, we always said it was. The helicopter above seemed to be going somewhere but then it just cycled around the clouds. You thought of churning butter, street crimes, richness, fame. What small dot were you to the motor in the air, only human because of your lack of grace, your head that needed to be above to live. A shape inside the shapeless. Not able to rid shape. Even when brought under, the shape stays, though flattened. The eel is the snake and the manta ray the bat. Transformations in the underworld proliferate and you are unable to stand on your head or hold your sister. Your skin wears the same dint with cosmetics. Your blink, that fear, displaced, running.","The eel is the snake and the manta ray the bat.

"I, New York","I long to hear the history of ordinary people who populate and recreate all over the NYC subway lines, strung together like beans on a charmbracelet drumming on their worldly advice and late-night distractions,
I smoked an ashtray’s worth of cigarettes, cold and tired and snuffing out the little fire on yellow brick walls baring my bones to the whims of demolition,
I jumped over to Manhattan from Staten Island wishing to be Superman but also making music, yes music, from stretched out lizard skins suspended in animation,
I wiped the hair off my scalp dancing around a hollow pumpkin, swore to the forehead of my German moms that I would be unmarried at 50 or otherwise relocate to a harsher life in Uzbekistan,
I hid behind cardamom, cumin, and Halal-style chicken with my eyes darted thinking about Egypt, and the ABCs of Atlantic Barclays Center, Brooklyn, and a biweekly regular named Catherine,
I drank in a tent in the Q train station at Beverly, never showered but always made time to guide clueless New Yorkers to alternative train service like an MTA angel,
I in a rush to get to a Malaysian restaurant in Chinatown dozed off daydreaming about mushrooms, catfish, silkworms and missed my destination by just one stop; went back the other way and still couldn’t stop dreaming,
I asked for baby formula, bow-legged and inarticulate, full of luck and lice on my silver hair, dashed from one street to the other, filling the night with whispers and threats of self-immolation,
I broke a mirror three years before, and now, feeling the effect of medications, yearned to go back to a more violent time in quiet white rooms praying to another religion mistaken for glued together plastic flowers,
I drank my Vietnamese sweat, turned around when spoken to in God’s language, offered fresh fish, pears, and dried plums on a makeshift altar afraid to blink under oath","I long to hear the history of ordinary people who populate and recreate all over the NYC subway lines, strung together like beans on a charmbracelet.

The Treasure,"Mountains, a moment’s earth-waves rising and hollowing; the earth too’s an ephemerid; the stars—
Short-lived as grass the stars quicken in the nebula and dry in their summer, they spiral
Blind up space, scattered black seeds of a future; nothing lives long, the whole sky’s
Recurrences tick the seconds of the hours of the ages of the gulf before birth, and the gulf
After death is like dated: to labor eighty years in a notch of eternity is nothing too tiresome,
Enormous repose after, enormous repose before, the flash of activity.
Surely you never have dreamed the incredible depths were prologue and epilogue merely
To the surface play in the sun, the instant of life, what is called life? I fancy
That silence is the thing, this noise a found word for it; interjection, a jump of the breath at that silence;
Stars burn, grass grows, men breathe: as a man finding treasure says ‘Ah!’ but the treasure’s the essence;
Before the man spoke it was there, and after he has spoken he gathers it, inexhaustible treasure.","""I fancy that silence is the thing, this noise a found word for it; interjection, a jump of the breath at that silence"" ""After death is like dated: to labor eighty years in a notch of eternity is nothing too tiresome, says the author."

Sea Ranch Psalm,"Vast emerald all day,
at dusk the sea turns to ink.
The sky, a bonfire.
Now let it be what it must,
though you will ask, Why? What did I do?
A full moon opens her white coat
to the dark matter of it—
the all-night breathing of sea,
its all-night breaking.
You were given a heart like a busted window,
and through it, arrives the gold
of late summer headlands
and one black marble
salted with constellations.
This man too, his rough hands,
and a dog the color of honey,
beside you at the end of a country.
Already the shadows throw down
their lean graves across the bluffs.
Deer rise up from hunger
and graze under the swerve of bats.
Or so the man must tell you.
Let blindness enter before you can imagine
what will take the place of your dread.
Say it will not be desolate.
Say that even in this new dark,
a sparrow begins its two-note trill
to keep count of the whole
going out, the whole coming in.
Beginning here, you will have to let trust
unfold like a softening seed.
And not just the man’s hands,
but whatever you touch—
you will have to let your fingers need.","A full moon opens her white coat                to the dark matter of it. Vast emerald all day,                at dusk the sea turns to ink.                The sky, a bonfire.                You were given a heart like a busted window,                and through it, arrives the gold."
Netherland,"Snow a celestial orchard in bloom,
mile after mile of pine and granite
clothed in an empire of silence.
We burned newspapers, a cord of wood, a bed frame
the squatters before us had left.
Mornings, our boots made tracks
beside the split moons of deer, the clawed prints of bear,
even as wind whittled it all away.
Some afternoons, there was sunlight through the windows
and we’d lie inside our zipped-together bags
moving like a legless shadow.
Nights, we heard wolves with the sky inside their throats.
No one but your friend knew where we were,
and he had driven us into the Rockies at dark,
saying, The nearest town is Netherland.
Meaning, you can't rescue astonishment
from a boy and girl lost inside the molten light of desire.
Imagine your first love as a road of crumbs
marking a path back to the awakened whole
and your future
as all the small, invisible hungers of this world      
devouring the trail.","We burned newspapers, a cord of wood, a bed frame                the squatters before us had left. No one but your friend knew where we were,                and he had driven us into the Rockies at dark."

Save me, Jesus, save me.

The Lives of the Saints,"I stand at the kitchen sink, washing wineglasses.
In the fifth century BCE, Heraclitus wrote that the way up
is the way down. Like my five empty bottles of merlot in recycle
and the depression I’d fallen into before quitting my job—
clinical director of the county emergency shelter—
which meant talking to children after their father lit them on fire,
the foster parents forcing them to eat from a dog bowl on the floor
while the biological kids ate at the dinner table.
The saints were all about suffering: scourges, crucifixion, drownings.
Nothing but death led a saint to give up on intercession.
As for me, I’d seen my last four-point restraint of a preteen with HIV,
last feral kid armed with a blade extracted from the pencil sharpener.
Now I look out the kitchen window, remembering this one kid,
her hair a dark forest of perfectly matched firs, her black eyes.
In Catholicism, only an exercise of infallible magisterium makes a saint.
Or to paraphrase Heraclitus, the pope decides if a saint’s way down
is the way up. For ten years, that girl was returned to us after every failed
placement, with a new tattoo or piercing for every john she’d tricked,
only to hang herself on her eighteenth birthday.
It was March, vernal equinox, first day of spring. Emancipated Minor,
they called her at Social Services, meaning no money, nowhere to go.
Did I already say she was extraordinarily beautiful?
Before her, I thought beauty was easy to see. Something the spirit feasted on,
while the saints starved themselves on behalf of the afflicted.
Now I set the wineglasses on a clean towel to dry.
Stare at the plum tree that secretly erupted into blossom overnight.
I still can’t tell you the girl’s name, but I’m whispering it to myself.
She taught me something true about beauty.
It is not just those impossibly perfect stars of petals detonated all at once.
It’s how you see the rain-dark branches when the white lace is gone.","In Catholicism, only an exercise of infallible magisterium makes a saint. The pope decides if a saint’s way down                is the way up. For ten years, that girl was returned to us after every failed placement."
Milk,"Even in the dream, it is long past the possible
when I uncover my breast and hold the baby
close enough to drink. How helpless he is
to resist, helpless as the mind in a deep dream
to stop and change direction. Though, on waking,
the mind remembers our grown daughters
and the room where we sleep, and beyond it,
the outside made white with smoke from a fire.
Remembers, yesterday’s eerie milk-gold light
we walked through, and stopped a moment
beside a baby fox. In the road, wasps lighted on his skull,
their black bodies beading his torn-apart torso,
while gnats and flies sipped at the glistening.
And the work of those winged things seemed a fire
chewing through manzanita and alder,
Douglas fir and cedar, the maggots and flies
and wasps carrying the forest out of the fox,
the way the fire carried the forest out of the world.
You asked then if a mother fox could feel sadness.
And because last night my mind had used a memory
of my body to deceive me, had pressed my son close,
believing if he drank, I could keep him,
I want to believe the dead fox was a twin,
a mirror image following yet behind the vixen,
the way a dream can shadow the mind,
and the mind helpless against our stillborn son
that lives inside my dreams and runs silent
as a wild fox behind our daughters. It was dusk
when we turned to go, so quickly the wasps and flies
rose together, as if the black-and-yellow robes
they carried through the milk-gold light had slipped
from the death they had just been covering. All of us helpless
against the beauty of the hurt world as it burns.","In a dream, a mother holds her stillborn son close to her breast, believing if he drank, I could keep him. On waking, the mind remembers our grown daughters and the room where we sleep, and the outside made white with smoke from a fire."

In the Yellowstone,"Little pin-prick geysers, spitting and sputtering; 
Little foaming geysers, that spatter and cough; 
Bubbling geysers, that gurgle out of the calyx of morning glory pools; 
Laughing geysers, that dance in the sun, and spread their robes like lace over the rocks; 
Raging geysers, that rush out of hell with a great noise, and blurt out vast dragon-gulps of steam, and, finishing, sink back wearily into darkness; 
Glad geysers, nymphs of the sun, that rise, slim and nude, out of the hot dark earth, and stand poised in beauty a moment, veiling their brows and breasts in mist; 
Winged geysers, spirits of fire, that rise tall and straight like a sequoia, and plume the sky with foam: 
O wild choral fountains, forever singing and seething, forever boiling in deep places and leaping forth for bright moments into the air,

Language of the Moon,"As a child I wanted as many letters
in my bloodstream as the planet Mercury
would allow and so traveled the city
on buses late afternoons and read all the billboards
high above the streets and byways,
on sides of factories and churches and never
heard the sermons of the displaced
or blustery talk of founding fathers, and saddened
when a route snaked through long tunnels,
and then eased when reemerged
out of the murder of light.
I could feel my veins thicken like the winnings
of a Powerball, and the mystery of women
lounging around a gray-bearded man in a silk
smoking jacket drinking a tumbler of cognac
was like the easeful glide of a narcotic dream.
My mouth puckered whenever lemon-colored
arches appeared five stories above the city
like golden gates to an unforeseen heaven.
As a rule, I never glanced at other commuters
or curators in loosened ties and tuxedos
who clutched brown-papered bottles
and nodded to a stillness as though murdered in a film.
Instead, I glimpsed myself looking out a window,
awed by Cartier timepieces and luxury cars
that asked was I hungry for speed
or ordered me to let my body drive.
I ate advertisements like sea waves eating a coastline,
and though my sense of self was as bruised as a moldy peach,
I learned to infrared my longings from the inside
and to tally my suspicions from a distance, and now,
when I read a newspaper, I flutter like a sparrow
at a birdfeeder, and when language spills out
of my skull like a massive cruise ship docked
and towering over a line of ramshackle huts
on an island whose blessed poor gaze up
as though a locker of dollars fell at their feet,
my brain closes and my veins burst
as if pollinating the white face of the moon.","As a child I wanted as many lettersin my bloodstream as the planet Mercury would allow. I could feel my veins thicken like the winnings of a Powerball.

"How could I have known I would need to remember your laughter,","the way it ricocheted—a boomerang flung 
from your throat, stilling the breathless air.
How you were luminous in it. Your smile. Your hair 
tossed back, flaming. Everyone around you aglow.
How I wanted to live in it those times it ignited us 
into giggles, doubling us over aching and unmoored
for precious minutes from our twin scars—
the thorned secrets our tongues learned too well
to carry. It is impossible to imagine you gone, 
dear one, your laugh lost to some silence I can’t breach,
from which you will not return.

The Woman Who Wanted a Child,"For a short time I walked the earth as a woman, breathed in the scent of gardenias and gasoline,
made love to a man. We lived in a small house with a narrow staircase leading upwards into nothing;
the second floor was never built. I fed him fresh garlic and parsley from our garden, the smell rising
to the top of the staircase where we made love, knees and ribcages bumping against the ceiling. But
my throat grew dry, my feet stuck in the dust. At night, while he slept, I walked down to the marsh
where the birds gathered to dive for fish, the water wetting my waterless lips, the gentle rocking
soothing the aches in my feet, my arms. Please, I said to the white tern bringing her six little
hatchlings bits of fish guts, you a mother who has so many children, help me a mother who has
none.
The next morning, I woke up vomiting feathers. In a few months, my belly was round and full as a
blowfish and I felt the flutter against my ribcage. I walked down to the banks of the marsh, spread
my legs, and out she came, a pure royal tern, her white feathers beaded with blood. She was hungry
and I had nothing to give her; she would not take my milk. I waded out to find the mother bird on
the other side of the marsh. I cannot help you, she said, I have my own children to feed. So I turned
into a fish. My daughter dove, grasped me in her beak, and swallowed me whole. Now, I live within
her light body. We spend our days upon the high winds, bumping only against the sky. Now, I feed
her.","For a short time I walked the earth as a woman, breathed in the scent of gardenias and gasoline. I made love to a man, fed him fresh garlic and parsley from our garden.

Holiday,"I spent the Christmas after your death hunched
above a puzzle; it had a thousand pieces,
the unmatched angles of a forest caught by early snow,
bright yellow leaves still clinging to their branches.
The photograph on the box was so clear
I could see each crack of rock, each leaf hung
above the brink of winter. The pieces lay scattered
about my dining room, a mess of white and yellow
waiting for me to set it right, so many thousands
of leaves, so much crumbling. Who could count?
Even a sister, even a wife of ten years
one day gets out of bed and puts on red
either because it’s Christmastime again
or because the black dresses sit unwashed in the laundry
and there’s nothing left to wear. I told myself
the leaves weren’t worth it. I told myself you were just
another falling. I did the laundry every day.

Courage Song for Scott Warren,"Sing: no more makeshift crosses
In the gangplank desert,
No more “dogcatcher trucks,”
No more jawbones under the moon—
Bring your rebellious grit, 
Like a bromide or a borderland candle,
To our bigotry-is-commonplace republic’s 
Chaos. Bold anima, dissenting angel, 
Among the betraying cliffs and dry washes, 
The yellow plumes of the palo verde,
Be runagate Harriet in a midnight cane field
(General Tubman!), be Martin bravely writing
In an abysmal Birmingham jail.
Yes, your boundless shepherd’s gallantry, 
Your on-tap compassion 
Is the rescuing sip 
& the heaven-sent gourd required
At all our desperate crossings.
 ","The song is a tribute to Martin Luther King, Jr. The song was written in response to King's jailing in Birmingham, Alabama. The lyrics include the words: ""Bring your rebellious grit, like a bromide or a borderland candle"""
Clarinet,"At my family’s stained window,
A morning jay.
I stop my scissoring,
As if I could reclaim
A Santiago of bird-call
& sudden ease,
As if I could annul
The battle-gray maze of gutting
Jails, courthouses, morgues—
Purgatory where I bend
Over the burlap,
Again & again,
To show the blunt,
Still disillusioning world
The smashed black bell
Of your clarinet.
A blue swatch of your work-shirt becomes 
The irrevocable, raw dusk 
Of that day;
Here, in this farrago of scraps,
Your living room as I found it: 
Lunatic with ripped song sheets …
In imploring red,
A beggar’s scuffed vermilion,
I’ve stitched:
Whoever sees my arpillera,
Help me to pray for my son.
He was seen leaving rehearsal
At 7 o’clock.
He was seen in detention
At Londres #38.
He was seen; he was seen...
After so many years, perhaps     
You wouldn’t recognize me, Leonel;
I’ve become the weatherworn,
Undocile woman
Manacled to a tyrant’s fence,
A mother dancing the gueca solo
In the monitored plaza,
The ache of my make-do arms
Trumpeted,
Your rakish college photo
Pinned to my wind-riffled blouse:
In the arpillera,
A tiny, vivid, appliquéd doll,
Forever mourning,
Forever swaying
To your unforgettable woodwind.

Is Not (Don’t Interrupt the Sorrow),"        in memory of Eric Garner, 1970–2014

A Taser is not an answer
A rushing bullet is not a dream
There is no sunny god
In an Apollo Helmet
A livelong mercenary is not
A frisking meadow lamb
Lady Justice is no 
Fearsome chimera
No lurking drone
No business-as-usual Cerberus
A callous Caesar is not
A far-seeing Christ—
*
Listen: a blazing Mississippi cross 
Never presages a messiah.
A daffodil in a “sundown town” never signals
The onset of spring—
*
So after two callous seasons,
I finally dared to inquire
If his taken-too-soon father’s ousting
“Stand Your Ground” assassin
Was indeed white, “lily-white”
& naturally his response
In this volatile demesne,
This gallery of averted eyes
& gimcrack defenders galore
Was yes 
Dear God of course yes
*
Don’t interrupt the sorrow
A woman croons
But all I catch is the ack-ack-ack
Of ink-blotter redaction, 
The X-rated sputter of a black site’s 
Water-boarded man
Or a flailing cigarette seller,
Cuffed, gasping for air,
Jinxing arm & insignia
Marring his throat:

Is not
Is not
Is not
Is not—

A Wading,"Many Black people that I know are afraid of the Ocean
not the textbook definition of feeling fear
but those who draw near
are only willing to wade
They are afraid 
to make waves
in a history that may sweep them away into the undercurrent of history repeating itself
because screaming help
didn’t assist our ancestors 
in fact the wading in the water
was a way to wash away a human’s scent
to leave dog’s noses no evidence 
of them being there
a passage way to freedom calling their names so quietly
only a soul could hear 
to draw near to that history is a stirring in our bones
an undertone 
that we put on a mute to silence what was never right
sometimes to win a fight
you get out of sight and yearn to be seen
beyond the horizon 
farther than the possible limit of sight
beyond what one was able to foresee
So in this time, there will be no repeat of history
We know where we came from
We know our destinations
No more plantations
We’re on a stay-cation
for a duration 
of our own imagination
We move in fascination
like the flow of water
We are the sons and daughters of our forefathers
Who left traces of themselves through blood, sweat, and tears
for years
of painful yesterdays
Imagine being enslaved during a slave trade and thought of a commodity 
Standing on docks
An auction block
of people of African descent 
Who didn’t know the possibility of an escape in those days
But were taught how to wade 
through labors leaving legacies 
Knowing how to Bob and Weave
Knitting together stories of unity 
A compass pointing in all directions of lifelines 
and Negro spirituals while peering through church windows
We are stained glass
with a colorful exterior 
of a painful past 
They called our neighbor “The Bottom”
8 miles from the Potomac River; where black people were free
Built our own homes and called it a community
Yet, many Black people that I know have a fear of the Ocean
But in their daily motions
They move through history like water flows
Absorbing, over, above, under, and around
a railroad and an underground
to freedom 
It’s not that we don’t know how to swim
We can propel our bodies through water
using the limbs
it’s that deep down we know our ancestors didn’t swim for pleasure in those days
it’s not that we are afraid
it’s that we’d rather move through our lives like the flow of water

Per aspera ad astra,"We were lost in the plains,
beautiful and ordinary.
Sunflowers in the fields,
seeds of fallen stars,
standing tall; deeply 
rooted in this land.
I’ve admired how our flowers
shine, grasping towards the sky,
beyond the prairie grass, anchored
down to earth; mimicking the sun.
When a gardener plants the 
seeds of Helianthus, they are 
performing magic. Raising
stars out of the dust where
buzzing planets circle, half 
red moons set, and swarming 
comets float in orange comas.
I’ve always felt that late at night, 
in the bed of a truck, in a Kansas field, 
we were at the center of this universe.
And I was exactly where I should be,
amongst the flowers, not below.","I’ve admired how our flowersshine, grasping towards the sky, beyond the prairie grass, anchored down to earth; mimicking the sun. When a gardener plants the                 seeds of Helianthus, they are performing magic."

In The Red,"you’ve worked so hard
from the farm to the factory
in the county & the city
you’ve always paid on time
for peace of mind
—your body as collateral
so you may rest & retire
when the time came
—knowing you’ll be fine
but somehow
you still owe today
& you are all out of body ","You’ve worked so hard. you’re all out of body  & you still owe today. You’ll be fine, but somehow you are still owed today."
Mi Isla,"I ate a mango today
it was mostly green
with reds and yellows.
El Yunque, at dawn
is mostly green
with reds and yellows.
My homeland’s enchanted
full of shady jungle mountains,
gawking naked beaches;
slowly necking ocean.
There, 
sea breezes woo the palm trees
and peeping coconuts faint
from holding on too long,
in sand, asleep;
daydreaming of me.
Tonight, 
un brindis por ti Papá.
Let us pretend, the crickets are
drunken coquies de parranda,
struggling with loss,
singing in the wrong key,
playing out of tune; unable
to find their way home.
Let us pretend, we are surrounded
by vacation not work,
that all this wheat is beach,
that the above blue is ocean.
Let us pretend, you are watching me, 
ripe in a hammock’s womb,
strung to horizons with no ocean
or beach sand near nor fear 
that I’ve become landlocked here,
surrounded by jíbaros,
who don’t like jíbaros;
still an island.","El Yunque, at dawn, is mostly green with reds and yellows. I ate a mango today; it was mostly green too."
Haiku,"I shovel snow
from Cleveland front lawn
just to see green
crow’s breath
after caw hangs,
winter air
snow furrow cornfield,
old woman peering
in roadside mailbox
office windowsill
fly poised for flight
three months now
sakura petals fallen
she gathers them in small hands
spills them on soft breeze
Kerouac, we knock
your pickled bones together,
zen be-bop
America, more guns
than people, more bullets
than tears
it took 800 years
for Roman Empire’s fall —
they had no internet
first man to walk
on the moon has died,
his footprint still up there
cleaning my office
I find a faded article,
“cleaning your office”
between bright stars
and atoms inside I spin,
breath burning away","America has more guns than people, more bullets than tears. It took 800 years for Roman Empire’s fall — they had no internet. The first man to walk on the moon has died."
Youth,"The dew is on the grasses, dear,
    The blush is on the rose,
And swift across our dial-youth,
    A shifting shadow goes.
The primrose moments, lush with bliss.
    Exhale and fade away,
Life may renew the Autumn time,
    But nevermore the May!","The dew is on the grasses, dear, and the blush is on a rose. The primrose moments, lush with bliss, fade away. But nevermore the May!"
Winter Solstice,"Late December grinds on down.
The sky stops, slate on slate,
scatters a cold light of snow
across a field of brittle weeds.
Each boot step cracks a stalk.
The pigments have been dragged
earthwards and clasped. The groundhog
curls among the roots curling.
Towards home I peel blossoms
of frozen mud from my pant legs
and pull off burrs that waited
for wind or the flashing red fox.
In my jacket pocket I find
a beechnut, slightly cracked
open, somehow fallen there,
and, enfolded inside of it,
a spider that unclenches
yellow in my steaming palm –
a spider that is 
the sun.","Late December grinds on down. The sky stops, slate on slate, encompasses a cold light of snow. The groundhog                curls among the roots curling."
Welt,"Would I might mend the fabric of my youth
That daily flaunts its tatters to my eyes,
Would I might compromise awhile with truth
Until our moon now waxing, wanes and dies.
For I would go a further while with you,
And drain this cup so tantalant and fair
Which meets my parched lips like cooling dew,
Ere time has brushed cold fingers through my hair!","""Would I might compromise awhile with truth,"" he writes. ""Until our moon now waxing, wanes and dies"" ""I would go a further while with you,"" he adds, ""and drain this cup so tantalant and fair"""
My Little Dreams,"I’m folding up my little dreams
Within my heart tonight,
And praying I may soon forget
The torture of their sight.
For Time’s deft fingers scroll my brow
With fell relentless art—
I’m folding up my little dreams
Tonight, within my heart!","The torture of their sight. I’m folding up my little dreams                Within my heart tonight,                And praying I may soon forget."
Grandfather’s Breath,"You work. You work, Buddy. You work.
Word of immigrant get-ahead grind I hear
huffing through me, my grandfather’s breath,
when he’d come in from Saturday’s keep-busy chores,
fending up a calloused hand to stop
me from helping him, haggard cheeks puffing
out like grey t-shirts hung between tenements,
doubled-over under thirty-five years a machine
repairman at the ball-bearing factory, ball-bearings
making everything run smoother—
especially torpedoes. He busted butt
for the war effort, for profiteers, for overtime pay
down-payment on a little box of his own,
himself a refugee from the European economy,
washed ashore after The War to End All Wars.
Cheap labor for the winners.
I hear his youth plodding through the hayfields
above Srednevas, and the train that wheezed
and lumbered to the Trieste, the boat where he heave-hoed
consumptive sister, one-two-overboard.
I hear him scuffling along factory smoke choked streets
of Cleveland, coughing out chunks of broken
English just to make it to Saturday morning balinca—
how he grunted off a week’s worth of grit
hurling wooden balls down the pressed dirt court,
sweaty wisp of gray hair wagging from his forehead,
This is how the world turns. You work hard. You practice.
And I hear his claim as we climbed the steps
of Municipal Stadium, higher, into the cheap seats,
slapping the flat of his hand against a girder,
I built this, Buddy. I built this.
But mostly I hear how he’d catch
what was left of his breath after those Saturday chores,
pouring out that one, long, tall cold beer
that Grandma allowed, holding it aloft,
bubbles golden as hayfields above Srednavas,
before savoring it down and taking up
the last task of his day off—cleaning the cage,
letting Snowball, canary like the ones once used
to test coal mines for poison air, flap clumsily free
around the living room, crapping
on the plastic covered davenport and easy-chair
they only sat in twice a year.
And I’m still breathing, Grandfather, that day
you took me down the basement to the cool floor
to find out what was wrong. Come on, Snowball,
fly. Fly! The bird splayed out on the same linoleum
where they found you, next to your iron lung,
where Grandma mopped for weeks after,
pointing with arthritic fingers, See. There.
There’s where he fell and bumped his head.
See the specks of blood? She can’t work out.
One fine morning when my work is done
I’m gonna fly away home, fly away home.
Come on, Snowball, fly. Fly!","Word of immigrant get-ahead grind I hear through me, my grandfather’s breath. He busted butt for the war effort, for profiteers, for overtime pay. He was a refugee from the European economy."
And What Shall You Say?,"Brother, come!
And let us go unto our God.
And when we stand before Him
I shall say—
“Lord, I do not hate,
I am hated.
I scourge no one,
I am scourged.
I covet no lands,
My lands are coveted.
I mock no peoples,
My people are mocked.”
And, brother, what shall you say?","“Lord, I do not hate,                I am hated.” “I covet no lands,                My lands are coveted.                I mock no peoples,.                My people are mocked.’ “And, brother, what shall you say?”"
Is it Because I am Black,"Why do men smile when I speak,
And call my speech
The whimperings of a babe
That cries but knows not what it wants?
Is it because I am black?
Why do men sneer when I arise
And stand in their councils,
And look them eye to eye,
And speak their tongue?
Is it because I am black?","Why do men smile when I speak, and call my speech the whimperings of a babe that cries but knows not what it wants? Is it because I am black?"
The Band of Gideon,"The band of Gideon roam the sky,
The howling wind is their war-cry,
The thunder’s roll is their trump’s peal,
And the lightning’s flash their vengeful steel.
        Each black cloud
        Is a fiery steed.
        And they cry aloud
        With each strong deed,
“The sword of the Lord and Gideon.”
And men below rear temples high
And mock their God with reasons why,
And live in arrogance, sin and shame,
And rape their souls for the world’s good name.
        Each black cloud
        Is a fiery steed.
        And they cry aloud
        With each strong deed,
“The sword of the Lord and Gideon.”
The band of Gideon roam the sky
And view the earth with baleful eye;
In holy wrath they scourge the land
With earthquake, storm and burning brand.
        Each black cloud
        Is a fiery steed.
        And they cry aloud
        With each strong deed,
“The sword of the Lord and Gideon.”
The lightnings flash and the thunders roll,
And “Lord have mercy on my soul,”
Cry men as they fall on the stricken sod,
In agony searching for their God.
        Each black cloud
        Is a fiery steed.
        And they cry aloud
        With each strong deed,
“The sword of the Lord and Gideon.”
And men repent and then forget
That heavenly wrath they ever met,
The band of Gideon yet will come
And strike their tongues of blasphemy dumb.
        Each black cloud
        Is a fiery steed.
        And they cry aloud
        With each strong deed,
“The sword of the Lord and Gideon.”","The band of Gideon roam the sky, the howling wind is their war-cry, the thunder's roll is their trump’s peal, and the lightning's flash is their vengeful steel.

Zalka Peetruza,"(Who Was Christened Lucy Jane)
She danced, near nude, to tom-tom beat,
With swaying arms and flying feet,
’Mid swirling spangles, gauze and lace,
Her all was dancing—save her face.
A conscience, dumb to brooding fears,
Companioned hearing deaf to cheers;
A body, marshaled by the will,
Kept dancing while a heart stood still:
And eyes obsessed with vacant stare,
Looked over heads to empty air,
As though they sought to find therein
Redemption for a maiden sin.
’Twas thus, amid force driven grace,
We found the lost look on her face;
And then, to us, did it occur
That, though we saw—we saw not her.",Lucy Jane was a 19th-century British poet. She wrote of a woman who danced near nude to a tom-tom beat. Her face was the only part of her body that was visible.

Negro Poets,"Full many lift and sing
Their sweet imagining;
Not yet the Lyric Seer,
The one bard of the throng,
With highest gift of song,
Breaks on our sentient ear.
Not yet the gifted child,
With notes enraptured, wild,
That storm and throng the heart,
To make his rage our own,
Our hearts his lyric throne;
Hard won by cosmic art.
I hear the sad refrain,
Of slavery’s sorrow-strain;
The broken half-lispt speech
Of freedom’s twilit hour;
The greater growing reach
Of larger latent power.
Here and there a growing note
Swells from a conscious throat;
Thrilled with a message fraught
The pregnant hour is near;
We wait our Lyric Seer;
By whom our wills are caught.
Who makes our cause and wrong
The motif of his song;
Who sings our racial good,
Bestows us honor’s place,
The cosmic brotherhood
Of genius—not of race.
Blind Homer, Greek or Jew,
Of fame’s immortal few
Would still be deathless born;
Frail Dunbar, black or white.
In Fame’s eternal light,
Would shine a Star of Morn.
An unhorizoned range,
Our hour of doubt and change,
Gives song a nightless day,
Whose pen with pregnant mirth
Will give our longings birth,
And point our souls the way?","Not yet the Lyric Seer,                The one bard of the throng,                With highest gift of song,                Breaks on our sentient ear.                The cosmic brotherhood—not of race.                Blind Homer, Greek or Jew,                Of fame’s immortal few would still be deathless born."
The Washer-Woman,"A great swart cheek and the gleam of tears,

Christmas Eve in France,"Oh, little Christ, why do you sigh
    As you look down tonight
On breathless France, on bleeding France,
    And all her dreadful plight?
What bows your childish head so low?
    What turns your cheek so white?
Oh, little Christ, why do you moan,
    What is it that you see
In mourning France, in martyred France,
    And her great agony?
Does she recall your own dark day,
    Your own Gethsemane?
Oh, little Christ, why do you weep,
    Why flow your tears so sore
For pleading France, for praying France,
    A suppliant at God’s door?
“God sweetened not my cup,” you say,
    “Shall He for France do more?”
Oh, little Christ, what can this mean,
    Why must this horror be
For fainting France, for faithful France,
    And her sweet chivalry?
“I bled to free all men,” you say
    “France bleeds to keep men free.”
Oh, little, lovely Christ—you smile!
    What guerdon is in store
For gallant France, for glorious France,
    And all her valiant corps?
“Behold I live, and France, like me,
    Shall live for evermore.”","Oh, little Christ, why do you sigh? As you look down tonight. On breathless France, on bleeding France, and all her dreadful plight? What bows your childish head so low? What turns your cheek so white?"

Timid Lover,"I who employ a poet’s tongue,
Would tell you how
You are a golden damson hung
Upon a silver bough.
I who adore exotic things
Would shape a sound
To be your name, a word that sings
Until the head goes round.
I who am proud with other folk
Would grow complete
In pride on bitter words you spoke,
And kiss your petaled feet.
But never past the frail intent
My will may flow,
Though gentle looks of yours are bent
Upon me where I go.
So must I, starved for love’s delight,
Affect the mute,
When love’s divinest acolyte
Extends me holy fruit.","I who employ a poet’s tongue, would tell you how I adore exotic things. I who am proud with other folk would grow complete in pride on bitter words you spoke, and kiss your petaled feet."
Uncle Jim,"“White folks is white,” says Uncle Jim;
“A platitude,” I sneer;
And then I tell him so is milk,
And the froth upon his beer.
His heart walled up with bitterness,
He smokes his pungent pipe,
And nods at me as if to say,
“Young fool, you’ll soon be ripe!”
I have a friend who eats his heart
Away with grief of mine,
Who drinks my joy as tipplers drain
Deep goblets filled with wine.
I wonder why here at his side,
Face-in-the-grass with him,
My mind should stray the Grecian urn
To muse on Uncle Jim.","“White folks is white,” says Uncle Jim;                “A platitude,’ I sneer;                And then I tell him so is milk,                And the froth upon his beer. “Young fool, you’ll soon be ripe!” he says."

Song of My Muhammad,"after Walt Whitman1
I know I have the best of time and space in my two black fists
                in my black brain, the way I can never, will never be measured,
                this, my immeasurable greatness,
                this, my beauty and my speed
                           I do not need
                               your white Jesus or even your feeble praise—
                               I know I’m the prettiest thing that ever lived.
No friend of mine tells me who I can worship,
no friend of mine stops my dance around the ring,
no friend of mine labels my chair anything but throne,
I have no chair, no church, no philosophy that does not salute me as a king,
                no man can stop my left hand hooking, hooking, 
                no man can stop the poetry I keep under my Louisville lip,
                I’m so mean I make medicine sick. 
Today, I shoulder my way into a crowded heaven,
where my hands are steady and my mind is strong,
                    and I say to my spirit: 
                    you are golden, even here, golden,
                    and my spirit says: I am satisfied. 
1using lines from Walt Whitman’s Song of Myself, verse 46, and Ali’s own words",I know I have the best of time and space in my two black fists. I know I’m the prettiest thing that ever lived. No friend of mine tells me who I can be.
Harriette Winslow and Aunt Rachel Clean Collard Greens on Prime Time Television,"In their dollhouse kitchen, 
they clean a bouquet
of collards
while the comedy of errors
unfolds around them—
Harriette in her pantsuit and that blackmother
smirk that signals the hard love only a mother
can muster. This, holy kitchen,
culinary sanctuary, covers them
in light, its white glory a bouquet
around their perfect hair. Their fingers know no errors
as they pick and place the collards.
There was an earthy magic in my mother cleaning collards,
their mineral scent, the sink-full of water my mother
plunged them into, the water which washed them of their errors—
greens baptized, clean from sediment and rock, our kitchen
sink her pulpit, the leafy bouquet
her holy book. How we wished we could be them,
touched by our mother’s godly hands, then
cleaned so well we forgot they were just collards—
they glistened, a sparkling bouquet
of dinner-yet-to-come, so loved by our mother
that even they forgot their natural bitterness. A kitchen
is sweetened when collards are cooking, the air a  
swelling porkfat perfume, the onion’s pungent terror
nulled by the ribboned greens—I loved to watch my mother cut them,
roll the piles of flat foliage up like a cigar, the kitchen
knife shining against a tight army of collards. 
We needed no superheroes when we had her, a mother
to rival every black mom on cable—no fragrant bouquet
could rival the smell of her greens and cornbread, the bouquet
of cotton swabs and peroxide she’d use to sanitize our playground errors.
She was a magician, more than just another mother—
she could turn an afro into a constellation of braids, adorn them
with a galaxy of beads. She could turn a sprawling batch of collards 
into a smooth and savory feast, a world exploding in her small kitchen.
Someday, mother, I will inherit that sweet bouquet  
of cocoa butter, Blue Magic, kitchen smoke and calm night air, 
the perfume of black motherhood. One day, I will learn how to cook them collards.","The author's mother was a magician, more than just another mother. She could turn a sprawling batch of collards into a smooth and savory feast, a world exploding in her small kitchen."
Photosynthesis,"When I was young, my father taught us
how dirt made way for food,
how to turn over soil so it would hold a seed,
an infant bud, how the dark could nurse it
until it broke its green arms out to touch the sun.
In every backyard we’ve ever had, he made a little garden plot
with room for heirloom tomatoes, corn, carrots, 
peppers: jalapeno, bell, and poblano—
okra, eggplant, lemons, collards, broccoli, pole beans,
watermelon, squash, trees filled with fruit and nuts,
brussels sprouts, herbs: basil, mint, parsley, rosemary—
onions, sweet potatoes, cucumber, cantaloupe, cabbage, 
oranges, swiss chard and peaches,
sunflowers tall and straightbacked as soldiers,
lantana, amaryllis, echinacea, 
pansies and roses and bushes bubbling with hydrangeas. 
Every plant with its purpose.
Flowers to bring worms and wasps. How their work matters here. 
This is the work we have always known,
pulling food and flowers from a pile of earth.
The difference, now: my father is not a slave,
not a sharecropper. This land is his and so is this garden,
so is this work. The difference is that he owns this labor.
The work of his own hands for his own belly, 
for his own children’s bellies. We eat because he works. 
This is the legacy of his grandmother, my great-granny.
Ollie Mae Harris and her untouchable flower garden.
Just like her hats, her flowerbeds sprouted something special,
plants and colors the neighbors could only dream of.
He was young when he learned that this beauty is built on work,
the cows and the factories in their stomachs, 
the fertilizer they spewed out—
the stink that brought such fragrance. What you call waste,
I call power. What you call work I make beautiful again.
In his garden, even problems become energy, beauty—
my father has ended many work days in the backyard, 
worries of the firehouse dropping like grain, my father wrist-deep
in soil. I am convinced the earth speaks back to him 
as he feeds it—it is a conversational labor, gardening.
The seeds tell him what they will be, the soil tells seeds how to grow,
my father speaks sun and water into the earth,
we hear him, each harvest, his heartbeat sweet, like fruit. ","Gardening is a ""conversational labor, gardening,"" writes author. ""What you call waste, I call power. What you call work I make beautiful again,"" she says."
Love Note: Surely,"with first line from Gwendolyn Brooks
Surely you stay my certain own, you stay
obtuse. Surely your kisses were little poisons 
gripping tight my lips, my arms, mapping their way
across my unsure body. Surely, this fission
is a gift—a gilded parcel laced like God, scent 
of Mother Mary’s milkbreath and her virgin promise,
that virginal mirror, me. Surely, I was sent—
and, incidentally, that other she, to put you on notice—
hearts aren’t toys for juggling, no, the blood
too sticky to really ever disappear—
surely you know that. Surely, your own beating brick withstood
the blows I tried to strike with my unrelenting care.
The morning opens, now, without your sun-blacked face—
the bluejays and morningbirds sing away your waste.","Gwendolyn Brooks' first novel was published in 1944. Brooks' novel, ""A Farewell to Arms,"" was published posthumously in 2007."
Summer Vacation in the Subjunctive,"If I were a woman. If I were a wanted woman. If I were a woman with soft fingers. If I were on a beach with a man—if he was a man, if a man can be a man before he acts like a man. If I were on a beach with a man and he held my hand. If I liked my hand being held, even if it was held at the wrong angle. If my wrist was wringing in pain but I kept it there. If my heart were held wrong, like my hand. If I kept it there. If I was kept. If I was kept in pain. If I were pain. If I were a woman—if I were a woman before I was a woman. If I were a woman who knew her body like a woman knows her body. If a woman knew. If I knew. If I were on a beach with that man—if, this time, that man dissolved into sand. If the sand became hot under my feet but my feet were gold. If a woman were made of sun. If I were made of sun. If I burned the world around me until it shone beautiful and brown. If this burning was called healing. If the healing made light.","If I were on a beach with a man and he held my hand. If I liked my hand being held, even if it was held at the wrong angle. If the sand became hot under my feet but my feet were gold. If a woman knew her body like a woman knows her body."
I Find the Earring that Broke Loose from My Ear the Night a White Woman Told Me the World Would Save Her,"I remember:
that earring made me feel so free, so full of beauty—the kind that you might notice. Beauty that could make my shoulders glow. I remember her face, alight with a devious curiosity in the porchlight of the house party—that party in that city which slathered a film over its racism with clean streets and yard signs proclaiming inclusion. That city in that American state which legally excluded Black residents in 1844, which entered the union, big, proud, and white. Does it matter that this woman was not evil, did not send bombs to kill children in a far-off country, did not buy or sell a single slave? Picking up the earring, unwearable until I find another hook on which to hang it from my ear, I remember, again, the words and their cool sting. I’m a white woman, people protect us. Does it matter what I said to invite these words? Does it matter that I did not invite these words? Does it matter that she thought this was a joke, a sign that she was on the “right side,” a way to pass a moment under the porchlight? I’ve been thinking about intention lately, how I'm always asked to consider how good a person is, what they meant versus what they said. I think about the man who called me colored at a hotel in 2019. I think about the n-word out of a white person’s mouth. About erasure. I wonder about the road to hell, which, they say, is paved in these same intentions—good. George Zimmerman intended to protect his sidewalk from Trayvon’s body, invasively alive. George Washington intended to protect America from Britain’s oppression—nevermind those oppressed Black bodies. Yes, I am weaving a rope between George Zimmerman and George Washington. Yes, I am saying it. My country tis of thee, sweet land of white supremacy. When she said it, my face could barely twist into anything but fatigue. I am tired over and over again of being told I am not human enough to matter. The white poet rages against me on Facebook. Maybe he imagines my blood against his ivory tower. Maybe he imagines the many bricks my foremothers and fathers built—LucillePhyllisGwendolynPaulLawrenceLangstonSoniaMayaNikki—tumbling at the flick of his well-educated thumb.  Is even my degree a different color, relegated to the back of a bus, a book? The business of poetry so thick with privilege, so smothered in the rust of its old gates—how can you breathe among all that rot? On the news, the man they call president tells us to go back from where we came. I think of all the lost ones thrown over boats, the ones locked away in cages, the ones here, sitting as American as the day is long and still called wrong. The earring says I once was lost when I find it, tells me it can be repaired. It is an earring of the struggle. It wants that ear it once called home, it wants to touch my brown skin and reflect it in its orbiting gold. I look for my pliers, my jewelry kit. The work is always the thing that makes us whole again.","The author has been thinking about intention lately, how she's always asked to consider how good a person is, what they meant versus what they said. ""I am tired over and over again of being told I am not human enough to matter,"" she writes."

This Side Up,"A few things I’ve learned from Henry Brown.
First, he was a Virginia slave—
Henry Brown arrived in Philadelphia March 30, 1849 as
a free man
Second, he got a nick name—
Henry Box Brown shipped himself in a wooden crate
that was 3 feet long by 2 feet wide and displayed the
words “dry goods” and “this side up”
Third, this side up is the best example of foreshadowing
I’ve ever learned about
Fourth, when Box Brown rose out of his crate that he
had just spent 30 hours
inside of...
he called
that moment
a resurrection.
So I ask—
Let your truth seep
What is within you that should rise
If you feel froggy – you leap
When was the last time
You truly felt Phoenix—
Because I can see—
That you’re fire—you’re fly
(At the same dang time)
I wonder
What are the limitations of your hunger
The trench of your thirst
Not for water—not for food
But for your future
I have a query of questions
For your internal tribe
Five!
Marching has become partial payment
The stakes of Freedom take a Kobe investment
Sometimes we’re fork and knife ready with no
plates – no mats – no table
Six:
Our people find moments of perseverance
When we’re being gambled
In between
Distraction and Destiny
Destruction and Divinity
Seventh thing I’ve learned:
Perfection is overrated
And it’s not worth more than the
Complete path.
Eight:
Other than skin color
Henry Box Brown mirrors Dr. King
Sometimes you’re too busy thinking outside the
box when God is telling you
to go in
Dream packages are shipped with His stamp of
approval
So square up dreamers
We’re already inside the ring
And it’s up to us to
Be boxed in
Or be ready to Box
Because as you know
As foreshadow-boxing goes
It’s always This Side Up",Henry Box Brown shipped himself in a wooden crate that was 3 feet long by 2 feet wide. The crate displayed the words “dry goods” and “this side up” Box Brown rose out of his crate after spending 30 hours inside.
Yet Do I Marvel,"I doubt not God is good, well-meaning, kind,
And did He stoop to quibble could tell why
The little buried mole continues blind,
Why flesh that mirrors Him must some day die,
Make plain the reason tortured Tantalus
Is baited by the fickle fruit, declare
If merely brute caprice dooms Sisyphus
To struggle up a never-ending stair.
Inscrutable His ways are, and immune
To catechism by a mind too strewn
With petty cares to slightly understand
What awful brain compels His awful hand.

But for my reaping only what the hand
Can hold at once is all that I can show.
Yet what I sowed and what the orchard yields
My brother’s sons are gathering stalk and root,
Small wonder then my children glean in fields
They have not sown, and feed on bitter fruit.",I have sown beside all waters in my day. I planted deep within my heart the fear that wind or fowl would take the grain away. I scattered seed enough to plant the land from Canada to Mexico.
Blight,"I have seen a lovely thing
Stark before a whip of weather:
The tree that was so wistful after spring
Beating barren twigs together.
The birds that came there one by one.
The sensuous leaves that used to sway
And whisper there at night, all are gone,
Each has vanished in its way.

And this whip is on my heart;
There is no sound that it allows,
No little song that I may start
But I hear the beating of dead boughs.","""I have seen a lovely thing before a whip of weather,"" he writes. ""The tree that was so wistful after spring                Beating barren twigs together"""
Nocturne at Bethesda,"I thought I saw an angel flying low,
I thought I saw the flicker of a wing
Above the mulberry trees; but not again.
Bethesda sleeps. This ancient pool that healed
A host of bearded Jews does not awake.
This pool that once the angels troubled does not move.
No angel stirs it now, no Saviour comes
With healing in His hands to raise the sick
And bid the lame man leap upon the ground.
The golden days are gone. Why do we wait
So long upon the marble steps, blood
Falling from our open wounds? and why
Do our black faces search the empty sky?
Is there something we have forgotten? some precious thing
We have lost, wandering in strange lands?
There was a day, I remember now,
I beat my breast and cried, “Wash me, God,
Wash me with a wave of wind upon
The barley; O quiet One, draw near, draw near!
Walk upon the hills with lovely feet
And in the waterfall stand and speak.
“Dip white hands in the lily pool and mourn
Upon the harps still hanging in the trees
Near Babylon along the river’s edge,
But oh, remember me, I pray, before
The summer goes and rose leaves lose their red.”
The old terror takes my heart, the fear
Of quiet waters and of faint twilights.
There will be better days when I am gone
And healing pools where I cannot be healed.
Fragrant stars will gleam forever and ever
Above the place where I lie desolate.
Yet I hope, still I long to live.
And if there can be returning after death
I shall come back. But it will not be here;
If you want me you must search for me
Beneath the palms of Africa. Or if
I am not there then you may call to me
Across the shining dunes, perhaps I shall
Be following a desert caravan.
I may pass through centuries of death
With quiet eyes, but I’ll remember still
A jungle tree with burning scarlet birds.
There is something I have forgotten, some precious thing.
I shall be seeking ornaments of ivory,
I shall be dying for a jungle fruit.
                        You do not hear, Bethesda.
O still green water in a stagnant pool!
Love abandoned you and me alike.
There was a day you held a rich full moon
Upon your heart and listened to the words
Of men now dead and saw the angels fly.
There is a simple story on your face;
Years have wrinkled you. I know, Bethesda!
You are sad. It is the same with me.","""The golden days are gone. I thought I saw an angel flying low, but not again"" ""There is something I have forgotten, some precious thing. I shall be dying for a jungle fruit"""
God Give to Men,"God give the yellow man
An easy breeze at blossom time.
Grant his eager, slanting eyes to cover
Every land and dream
Of afterwhile.
Give blue-eyed men their swivel chairs
To whirl in tall buildings.
Allow them many ships at sea,
And on land, soldiers
And policemen.

No need to bother more
But only fill afresh his meed
Of laughter,
His cup of tears.

The taste of soul’s desire.",God give the yellow man an easy breeze at blossom time. God give the blue-eyed men their swivel chairs. God suffer little men to have the taste of soul’s desire.
Poem,"Little brown boy,
Slim, dark, big-eyed,
Crooning love songs to your banjo
Down at the Lafayette—
Gee, boy, I love the way you hold your head,
High sort of and a bit to one side,
Like a prince, a jazz prince. And I love
Your eyes flashing, and your hands,
And your patent-leathered feet,
And your shoulders jerking the jig-wa.
And I love your teeth flashing,
And the way your hair shines in the spotlight
Like it was the real stuff.
Gee, brown boy, I loves you all over.
I’m glad I’m a jig. I’m glad I can
Understand your dancin’ and your
Singin’, and feel all the happiness
And joy and don’t-care in you.
Gee, boy, when you sing, I can close my ears
And hear tomtoms just as plain.
Listen to me, will you, what do I know
About tomtoms? But I like the word, sort of,
Don’t you? It belongs to us.
Gee, boy, I love the way you hold your head,
And the way you sing and dance,
And everything.
Say, I think you’re wonderful. You’re
All right with me,
You are.","Gee, boy, I love the way you hold your head, high sort of and a bit to one side, like a prince, a jazz prince. And I love your teeth flashing, and the way your hair shines in the spotlight. I’m glad I can feel all the happiness and joy and don’t-care in you."
The Road,"Ah, little road, all whirry in the breeze,
A leaping clay hill lost among the trees,

Caught in a drowsy bush

Dust of the dust, they must not bruise you down.

A Decade,"When you came, you were like red wine and honey,

Smooth and pleasant.

Sonnet to a Negro in Harlem,"You are disdainful and magnificent—
Your perfect body and your pompous gait,
Your dark eyes flashing solemnly with hate,
Small wonder that you are incompetent
To imitate those whom you so despise—
Your shoulders towering high above the throng,
Your head thrown back in rich, barbaric song,
Palm trees and mangoes stretched before your eyes.
Let others toil and sweat for labor’s sake
And wring from grasping hands their meed of gold.
Why urge ahead your supercilious feet?
Scorn will efface each footprint that you make.
I love your laughter arrogant and bold.
You are too splendid for this city street.",You are disdainful and magnificent. You are too splendid for this city street. Let others toil and sweat for labor’s sake and wring from grasping hands their meed of gold.
Remember Not,"Remember not the promises we made
In this same garden many moons ago.
You must forget them. I would have it so.
Old vows are like old flowers as they fade
And vaguely vanish in a feeble death.
There is no reason why your hands should clutch
At pretty yesterdays. There is not much
Of beauty in me now. And though my breath
Is quick, my body sentient, my heart
Attuned to romance as before, you must
Not, through mistaken chivalry, pretend
To love me still. There is no mortal art
Can overcome Time’s deep, corroding rust.

from “The Rose”,"I heard myself in every cell the singer sang
The wind in the singer had to pass through her heart
When the queen ascended into view I was with her, hiding
In her darkness. When she fell from favor
I fell too. I governed
Myself with silence. I covered my wound
In my own naked body
I said no protest words when the stranger 
Entered me. I’ll forget his face, I told myself
I closed my eyes and I did not forget it
Though it was many a good thing in spite of this
I did manage to forget: healing
Potions, songs, and secret sounds
The rose with its mouth like a child’s, asleep
Minaret, thorn, spire, steeple
Wishful flavor, exhausted people
Two cups of blood, one grain of sand
Receding flesh with your tooth in its hand
If I knew the words I would bid the mother of us all be seated
As it is I pull out a chair for my own mother to sit in
I offer her a cigarette
I light it for her in my mouth","I governed myself with silence. I heard myself in every cell the singer sang. I’ll forget his face, I told myself. I closed my eyes and I did not forget it."

Invocation,"Let me be buried in the rain
In a deep, dripping wood,
Under the warm wet breast of Earth
Where once a gnarled tree stood.
And paint a picture on my tomb
With dirt and a piece of bough
Of a girl and a boy beneath a round, ripe moon
Eating of love with an eager spoon
And vowing an eager vow.
And do not keep my plot mowed smooth
And clean as a spinster’s bed,
But let the weed, the flower, the tree,
Riotous, rampant, wild and free,
Grow high above my head.","Let me be buried in the rain, in a deep, dripping wood. Let the weed, the flower, the tree, grow high above my head. Do not keep my plot mowed smooth and clean as a spinster’s bed."
Emancipation,"Fling out your banners, your honors be bringing,
Raise to the ether your paeans of praise.
Strike every chord and let music be ringing!
Celebrate freely this day of all days.
Few are the years since that notable blessing,
Raised you from slaves to the powers of men.
Each year has seen you my brothers progressing,
Never to sink to that level again.
Perched on your shoulders sits Liberty smiling,
Perched where the eyes of the nations can see.
Keep from her pinions all contact defiling;
Show by your deeds what you’re destined to be.
Press boldly forward nor waver, nor falter.
Blood has been freely poured out in your cause,
Lives sacrificed upon Liberty’s altar.
Press to the front, it were craven to pause.
Look to the heights that are worth your attaining
Keep your feet firm in the path to the goal.
Toward noble deeds every effort be straining.
Worthy ambition is food for the soul!
Up! Men and brothers, be noble, be earnest!
Ripe is the time and success is assured;
Know that your fate was the hardest and sternest
When through those lash-ringing days you endured.
Never again shall the manacles gall you
Never again shall the whip stroke defame!
Nobles and Freemen, your destinies call you
Onward to honor, to glory and fame.","Celebrate freely this day of all days. Fling out your banners, your honors be bringing,Raise to the ether your paeans of praise."
"It happened just like this for you, too, didn’t it?","You could not have been happier,
not a dancer, but did a jig in our courtyard
to the sweet streams of doo wop.

The innocent harmony of the Deltones,
and in 40 days you’d be staring at a ceiling
in an Emergency Room at Mt. Sinai Hospital.

This could be just like that …
Seeing double is worse than seeing single
It could be a precursor to a stroke

It could be anything, an interruption in service
of a perfectly working eye that gives up
that takes a powder when you least expect it.

That roars out of the station into a crash
against a wall, a motorcar, a vision that
decomposes, disintegrates, breaks down

into pixels, but this was not that.
This was seeing two, double vision, one eye
just as life was opening its third eye, letting

me see what I could do in this life without you
the fallow air around your grave that I never
visit, imagine, the whole thing a big mistake

as long as there is no marker, no one can find
you because you are not really there anymore.
I dressed you in the wrong jacket, not your

favorite shirt, but one a high school friend envied.
Why still after all this time, do I remember of all things,
I sent you away in an ill-fitting but new jacket

I knew I’d never give it away, I’d never wear it, I tossed
it into the coffin with your grandmother’s rosary beads,
your holy card to Vito Marcantonio, God only knows

what else I placed in the coffin, knowing even as
I neared that powdery skinned man in that box
that you had already left, that pain was gone.","I dressed you in the wrong jacket, not your favorite shirt, but one a high school friend envied.

Youth Insatiate,"If I have wished for skies unscarred by storm,

Cried out against it all, cried out for peace,
Even what peace the rotting dead possess,
May Life forgive me: I am stronger now,
The play bewilders, but I know my part;
And I have learned that Beauty is salt blood
Pain-wrung from the unconquerable heart.
Let there be laughter then, love’s wine and bread,
The many mouths of passion, their joys, their grief;
These are but soil and seed—for what grave growths?
I plant and wait, (and pray the time be brief!)

Like a scared virgin who must stop for breath.

I said: there is no kiss can feed me now.
Perhaps love is life’s flower: I seek the root.
Yea, I have loved and love is dead sea fruit.
Yet, I lie here and kiss your dented pillow,
A trembling girl who loves you overmuch––
A harp in anguish for the player’s touch.",I said once: Love alone cannot assuage my thirst. Now you are gone I kiss your dented pillow and wonder if it hungers like my breast.
The Hole in My Curtain,"It is because of the hole in my curtain.
I have stared through the torn space
Into Life’s tortured face
As she leaned low and treadled her loom,
Watching, watching for inevitable doom.
And I have seen the haggard shadows flit
Over the tapestries she wove, bit by bit
Feverishly, her lips shrieking gay lies;
And always the tired song in her endless eyes.
I have watched the Form with his weary
            cynical face,
His pale smile, his definite, measured pace,
Gliding forward and gliding back like a
thing condemned
        from end to end.
And calmly slitting Life's woven cloths
And they have wondered that I should laugh!
Marvelled at the potent wines I quaff.
Marvelled that I should dance on their God's
            dried flesh,
Shape a lute from a bone of His; weave a mesh
Of mirthless melody; that I should find Sin fair,
Circle her body and sleep in her odorous hair.
They have marveled that I should mock the day,
Throw my veil over the sun and smile at Fate's
             old play;
Lead my soul down the ribald, flowered path.
They have marveled. . . they have wondered
that I should laugh.
                    in my curtain.
I have looked too long through the hole.",It is because of the hole in my curtain. I have stared through the torn space into Life’s tortured face. They have wondered that I should laugh! I have looked too long through the hole.
Episode,"I have robbed the garrulous streets,
Thieved a fair girl from their blight,
I have stolen her for a sacrifice
That I shall make to this mysteried night.
I have brought her, laughing,
To my quietly sinister garden.
For what will be done there
I ask no man’s pardon.
I brush the rouge from her cheeks,
Clean the black kohl from the rims
Of her eyes; loose her hair;
Uncover the glimmering, shy limbs.
I break wild roses, scatter them over her.
The thorns between us sing like love’s pain.
Her flesh, bitter and salt to my tongue,
I taste with endless kisses and taste again.
At dawn I leave her
Asleep in my wakening garden
(For what was done there
I ask no man’s pardon.)",I have robbed the garrulous streets and stolen a fair girl from their blight. I have stolen her for a sacrifice that I shall make to this mystery night. I ask no man’s pardon.
I Must Be Far,"I must be far from men and women
To love their ways.
I must be on a mountain
Breathing greatly like a tree
If my heart would yearn a little
For the peopled, placid valley.
I must be in a bare place
And lonely as a moon
To find the graceless ways of people
Worthful as a flower’s ways,
A flower that lives for loneliness
And dies when beauty dies.
I cannot find music
On the tongues of men and women
Unless I hear their voices
Like echoes, silence-softened.
Their many words mean little.
Their mouths are blatant sparrows.
I must be far from men and women,
As God is far away,
To keep my faith with Beauty,
My heart sweet towards them,
And love them with a god’s tranquility.","I must be in a bare place                And lonely as a moon                To find the graceless ways of people                Worthful as a flower’s ways,                A flower that lives for loneliness and dies when beauty dies.

Roots,"O heavily weighing earth! O grim travail
In sunless silence with no hope of light!
O impotent wine! O bracken-food of pain!
I accept you all. I accept the timeless blight
Of crawling like a worm with unclean things,
Of being forever a yearning voiceless root
Bedded in this unwarmed oblivion
So that the great sun mellow my ultimate fruit.","""I accept you all. O heavily weighing earth! O grim travail! O sunless silence with no hope of light!"" ""O impotent wine! O bracken-food of pain!"" ""I accept the timeless blight"""
Futility,"Under all beauty that I know,
All vital dreams,
Sharp loveliness,
Under the hair, the lips of laughter,
The dusk-dim eyes of pain,
Lurks the single thing I fear,
Hard-mouthed, implacable-eyed,
The monster,
The satyr-thing, futility.
I cannot look on loveliness
Or burn the flame of ecstasy,
Or even dream for very long,
Without the annihilating fear
That it will suddenly tear some veil
And bare its dreadful face.
When I am light with the exaltation
Mysteriously born of worship,
Filled like a cup with the wine of wonder
At some great cloudy bloom of color,
Or learning the infinite secrets of rapture
With bared heart held to love’s lips—
Light’s eyes are suddenly blinded,
Life gropes in empty twilight,
And the mocking mouth of the satyr-thing
Leers at me from a veil of dust.
Shuddering I crouch to earth,
Trembling lest it come more near,
Trembling lest it stretch a hand
And touch me! Choked by an agony
Of horror lest its deadly eyes
Should shrivel my flaming heart of dream.
Sometimes I think the universe,
Mind, passion, beauty, wisdom, light,
All fathomless life-wonders,
Serve only for its cloak.
It lurks like death in everything
That has a singing heart:
In all exultant voices,
In all desire’s burning eyes,
In youth’s true soul,
In love’s slim hands,
Sometimes I think it is life’s core,
This mocking-mouth’d implacable ghost.
Sometimes I think it is life’s core.
Sometimes I think it must be God.","Lurks the single thing I fear, hard-mouthed, implacable-eyed, the monster. I cannot look on loveliness or burn the flame of ecstasy, or even dream for very long, without the annihilating fear that it will suddenly tear some veil and bare its dreadful face."
Come And Lie With Me,"Come and lie with me and love me,
Bitterness.
Touch me with your hands a little,
Kiss me, as you lean above me,
With your cold sadistic kisses;
Wind your hair close, close around me,

Hurt me even, even wound me,
I have need of love that stings.

Bitterness.
So that I may laugh at things.","""I have need of love that stings"" ""Come and lie with me and love me"" ""Pain might dissipate this blankness"" ""I may laugh at things"""
Oversoul,"My laughter rings in the highest mountains,
My mockery echoes vividly over the peaks,
My laughter and my mockery dance lightly together
Like derisive imps… But my soul never speaks.
My wisdom sits on a promontory
And remotely overwatches the world;
My pain stays forever in that cave
Where the ragged ends of life come unfurled.
My love cuts downward between mountains
Like a torrential, cataract, to the deeps,
For love, like life, is a down-going.
But my soul is like a thing that sleeps.
It knows the remorseless depths,
The thinnest ether of the farthest height;
There are no lights or darkness for its discovering
It has crawled on the earth and it knows the joy of flight
It is speechless because it knows all speeches,
Future and present and what has gone before.
It waits sphinxlike, and I myself
Cannot guess what it is waiting for.","""My laughter rings in the highest mountains, my mockery echoes vividly over the peaks"" ""But my soul is like a thing that sleeps. It waits sphinxlike, and I myself cannot guess what it is waiting for"""
Grain and Grapes,"This word came to me
From one whose wisdom shapes
The destiny of many:
Let your thought be fruitful:
Men like grain and grapes.
I’ll not be loved of men for my gifts
If men want grain and grapes alone:
My thoughts are gnarled, fantastic trees,
Grown up untended, barely pruned,
From ancient seed I have not sown.
Their snake-mouthed roots are in my heart.
I feel them hungrily intense
Drawing the seething love-sap out.
Prodigally I feed them all
My being’s vivid affluence.
But thus far they have only borne
Veined blue buds that bloom to be
Scarred flowers of inhuman pain,
And little opening leaves, like eyes
Full of a grave futility.
Strange flowers foretell strange fruit
And gods stay breathless while they grow
Men call and look for grain and grapes,
Their homely, humble earth-warm fruits;
But heaven is silent. The gods may know.","The poet's thoughts are gnarled, fantastic trees, he writes. They have grown up untended, barely pruned, from ancient seed he has not sown. The gods may know."
Commemoration,"When first your glory shone upon my face
   My body kindled to a mighty flame,
And burnt you yielding in my hot embrace
   Until you swooned to love, breathing my name.
And wonder came and filled our night of sleep,
   Like a new comet crimsoning the sky;
And stillness like the stillness of the deep
   Suspended lay as an unuttered sigh.
I never again shall feel your warm heart flushed,
   Panting with passion, naked unto mine,
Until the throbbing world around is hushed
   To quiet worship at our scented shrine.
Nor will your glory seek my swarthy face,
   To kindle and to change my jaded frame
Into a miracle of godlike grace,
   Transfigured, bathed in your immortal flame.","""I never again shall feel your warm heart flushed, Panting with passion, naked unto mine,Until the throbbing world around is hushed. To quiet worship at our scented shrine"""
“So Quietly”,"News item from the New York Times on the lynching of a Negro at Smithville, Ga., December 21, 1919: “The train was boarded so quietly . . . that members of the train crew did not know that the mob had seized the Negro until informed by the prisoner’s guard after the train had left the town . . . A coroner’s inquest held immediately returned the verdict that West came to his death at the hands of unidentified men.”
So quietly they stole upon their prey
And dragged him out to death, so without flaw
Their black design, that they to whom the law
Gave him in keeping, in the broad, bright day,
Were not aware when he was snatched away;
And when the people, with a shrinking awe,
The horror of that mangled body saw,
“By unknown hands!” was all that they could say.
So, too, my country, stealeth on apace
The soul-blight of a nation. Not with drums
Or trumpet blare is that corruption sown,
But quietly—now in the open face
Of day, now in the dark—and when it comes,
Stern truth will never write, “By hands unknown.”"," lynching of a Negro at Smithville, Ga., December 21, 1919. Coroner’s inquest held immediately returned the verdict that West came to his death at the hands of unidentified men."
Epilogue,"Why are you laughing, Poet?
I much prefer your sighs.
I myself have just read one of your songs
And tears are biting my eyes.
And why should I not laugh?
I cleaned my heart of its dust,
Swept my spirit clear of its cobwebs,
Gathered them up and thrust
Them from me. And then
Men passing, found the whole,
Called them songs and sang them and exulted.
They thought they had found my soul.","The poet asks: Why are you laughing, Poet? I much prefer your sighs. I myself have just read one of your songs and tears are biting my eyes. Why should I not laugh?"
A Thought,"There are more songs in the far corners
           of my soul
Than I shall ever be able to sing.
I shall go away long before they are
           all expressed
And they will wait for another life, for
           more suffering,
To give them birth; another life and many
           more tears
And love, to make them open their eyes to
           the light.
It will take many lives to express all
           the songs
I hear singing to themselves day and night.",There are more songs in the far corners of my soul than I shall ever be able to sing. It will take many lives to express all the suffering and love I feel.
Before Sleep,"There is an autumn sadness upon me,
A sadness of bared trees,
And mist and delicate death of flowers.
There is an autumn sadness upon me,
A falling of leaves in my soul.
There is an autumn sadness upon me,
A dreamfulness in my heart,
And a wistful sense of longing.
There is faint moaning music
Like cries of departing birds.
There are trembling hands on my eyelids,
A dim foreknowledge of tears
And dreams, patterning ultimate slumber.
There is an autumn sadness upon me,
A falling of leaves in my soul.","There is an autumn sadness upon me,                A falling of leaves in my soul. There is a sadness of bared trees,                And mist and delicate death of flowers."
Loneliness,"This loneliness encaged in me
That has no curious heart for life,
No ribald blood, no treacherous flesh
Nor golden wickedness of song,
This loneliness that prays in me,
Is it not somewhat like a nun?
See the clasped hands, the secret eyes,
The lips pressed close for fear of love!
What if I make her drunk one day
With wine or some unholy need
Then leave the cell door open wide––
Think you she might be tempted out?","This loneliness encaged in me has no curious heart for life, he writes. ""It has no ribald blood, no treacherous flesh, nor golden wickedness of song,"" he adds."
Chance,"Strange that a single white iris
Given carelessly one slumbering spring midnight
Should be the first of love,
Yet life is written so.
If it had been a rose
I might have smiled and pinned it to my dress:
We should have said Good Night indifferently
And never met again.
But the white iris!
It looked so infinitely pure
In the thin green moonlight.
A thousand little purple things
That had trembled about me through
          the young years
Floated into a shape I seem always to have known
That I suddenly called Love!
The faint touch of your long fingers on mine
          wakened me.
I saw that your tumbled hair was bright
          with flame,
That your eyes were sapphire souls with
          hungry stars in them,
And your lips were too near not to be kissed.
Life crouches at the knees of Chance
And takes what falls to her.","A single white iris should be the first of love, yet life is written so. The faint touch of your long fingers on mine wakened me. Your eyes were sapphire souls with hungry stars in them."
To a Young Dancing Girl,"Golden-eyed girl, do you see what I see?
Do you see behind the veil that Life
           laughs through?
Golden-eyed girl, I would like to laugh
           with you.
But my veil is torn, and I see things pass
Like shadows in the depths of a crystal glass.
Golden-eyed girl, you are young as springtime,
Your great eyes are dreamful, your rare
           lips sweet.
Shadows matter little to youth with dancing feet
All of Life’s skeletons wear gay dresses
And youth is deceived by even Death’s caresses.
Golden-eyed girl, you have years to dance and
           wonder
Before your Life’s curtain will wear into holes
And let you see the hopelessness hidden in souls.
You have many moons of laughter, many
           years to go
Before you’ll learn how heavy dancing feet
           can grow.","Golden-eyed girl, I would like to laugh with you. But my veil is torn, and I see things pass. Like shadows in the depths of a crystal glass."
Poppy Song,"Love in a garden of poppies
Playing at living life,
Love with smiles in her speech,
Love dancing at dawn
In a garden of flushed pink poppies.
Love, unsmiling now,
At noon in the garden of poppies,
With a laugh under her eyelids,
Fear deep in her eyes,
And tangled with her hair,
Sighs and a struggling joy.
Love, with a dim, strained face,
At night in the garden of poppies,
Her lips crushing the bloom
From the fairest flower there.
Love drunk with the wine
She has drawn from the poppy’s heart:
Love with death at her breasts.
Love at the end of night
Shaded by drooping poppies;
Love with scattered hair
And strange stains on her lips.
Love with death at her breasts.","Love in a garden of poppies: playing at living life, with smiles in her speech, dancing at dawn. Love with death at her breasts. Love drunk with the wine she has drawn from the poppy’s heart."
Dawn,"Dawn opens like a great gold flower,
Petal by monstrous petal,
Quivering minute by minute,
Hour by hour.
Stretches great live leaves over hundreds
           of hills,
Scatters flakes of pollen dust into a
           few valleys,
Drops a loose petal down where a slender
           waterfall spills.
Morning opens like a gold flower,
Stirs and quivers singingly at the feet of the day;
Shoots transparent light into a moving mist
That wrists spirally
Like a butterfly at play.
In the heart of the mist, morning opens, a
           gold flower,
Superbly, like a dawning passion.
Can night be the consummation
Of this expectant white hour?","Dawn opens like a great gold flower, with petal by monstrous petal, quivering minute by minute, minute by hour, hour by hour. Dawn stretches great live leaves over hundreds of hills of hills."
Chant of Spring,"Like an unhappy woman Earth frees herself

          awakening kisses,
Burning her lips and eyelids with flaming mouth

Relinquishment,"Go her way, her quiet, quiet way,
Her way is best for one so wistful-tired.
My three-months’ lover, go with your
            world-sick heart,
Your love-bruised flesh. I am no sanctuary.
This hot mouth, these ardent, out-reaching arms,
This hollow between my breasts, these
            hungry limbs,
They are a cradle, a cradle of living flame;
No haven for you, saddening after peace.
I am not certain, no, nor soothing-safe.
Mine is the shifting, perilous way of life.
Pitiless, ever-changing, hazardous,
My love insatiate and mutable.

World Cry,"There are gods in the market place. 
Did you know there were gods there?

I think they like to pray and mourn.

“A new God will soon be born!”
For a joy-song I would sing:

The Friend Departs,"'Tis not alone that you have gone from me:
All the hungry, fragile roots of hope
Are blasted by a Thing I cannot name;
And I am desolate remembering
The rare kiss, the intimate silent climbing
From passion to a breathless comprehension.
Even my peace of heart, born of long pain,
Dies, drowned in a turbulence of passion.
Life today is like a glass reflecting
Nothing more than my own grieving eyes,
Or like a goblet that I sit and stare at,
Empty of all but stains of last night's wine.","All the hungry, fragile roots of hope are blasted by a Thing I cannot name. 'Tis not alone that you have gone from me'"
Constancy,"You're jealous if I kiss this girl and that.
You think I should be constant to one mouth.
Little you know of my too quenchless drouth.
My sister, I keep faith with love, not lovers.
Life laid a flaming finger on my heart,
Gave me an electric golden thread,
Pointed to a pile of beads and said:
Link me one more perfect than the rest.
Love's the thread, my sister, you a bead,
An ivory one, you are so delicate.
These first burned ash-grey—far too passionate.
Farther on the colors mount and sing.
When the last bead's painted with the last design
And slipped upon the thread, I'll tie it so,
Then smiling quietly, I'll turn and go
While vain Life boasts her latest ornament.","Life laid a flaming finger on my heart, bestowed an electric golden thread, pointed to a pile of beads and said:Link me one more perfect than the rest. You're jealous if I kiss this girl and that girl. You think I should be constant to one mouth."
When Love Becomes a Stranger,"When Love becomes a stranger
In the temple he has built
Of remembered nights and days,

And the magical-sweet incense
Vanishes . . .

In any god's heart?",When Love becomes a stranger                In the temple he has built.                The magical-sweet incense                Vanishes.                Do you think there is grief born                In any god's heart?
Love Sleep,"Watch my Love in sleep:
Is she not beautiful
As a young flower at night
Weary and glad with dew?
Pale curved body
That I have kissed too much,
Warm with slumber's flush;
Breasts like mounded snow,
Too small for children's mouths;
Lips a red spring bud
My love will bring to bloom.
How restlessly she moves!
She, no more than a child,
Stirs like a woman troubled
With guilt of secret sins.
Twin furtive tears
Glide from the shadows,
Her eyes' shadowed blue.
Her dreaming must be sad.
What grief to watching love
That it is impotent,
For all its reckless strength,
When the sleep gates close.","Watching my Love in sleep: Is she not beautiful? She is like a young flower at night, he writes. She stirs like a woman troubled with guilt of secret sins, he says."
Market Maze,"Faces, faces...
Restless faces and restless hands, 
Not the divine restlessness 
Of seeking, singing spirits.

Of a creature mad for wings.
But a feeble thing,
A futile thing:

The fever of buying and selling.","The restlessness of the market place,                 The fever of buying and selling. The restlessness                 Of seeking, singing spirits. The restless hands of a creature mad for wings."
Life's Leaders,"Their clouded wine, their whited bread,
We cannot take and call it good;
Yet sorrier fare Life grudges us 
Who have no taste for common food.
We must go hungry long life through, 
Aching and hungry to the end;
Betrayed by pity into chains 
Reason tries vainly to transcend.
Are we not sadly prodigal?
We spend ourselves without restraint;
Yea, we let Beauty break our hearts 
And bleed for love until we faint.
Yet it is not the thorns, the shame,
Not the hurt body’s weak distress:
Our bitterest crucifixion lies 
In man’s abject unworthiness.
From Life’s rough cloth and flying threads,
From dust, from passion, dreams and pain, 
From the dear madness men call love,
From faith that lies beyond the brain,
We shape the only deathless soul 
That mortal man will ever know.
Behold his gratitude, these stones.
They say ‘t is by the heart we grow.
Still we build quietly and wait.
The heart may break; the heart is frail; 
But a stern, strange ecstasy 
Befriends us; and we dare not fail.
The Hand that points the solemn way 
May be a wanton hand at best;
The great Word echoing in our souls 
May be a bored God’s casual jest.
We cannot guess. We only know 
‘T is written by some awful Pen 
We must be torches sacrificed 
To light the way for lesser men.","We must go hungry long life through, Aching and hungry to the end;Betrayed by pity into chains, reason tries vainly to transcend. Our bitterest crucifixion lies in man’s abject unworthiness."
The Islands of Africa,"     to Rimbaud
Two pages to a grape fable
dangles the swan of samite blood
shaping sand from thistle covered fog
Over sacred lakes of fever
(polished mouths of the vegetable frog
rolling to my iron venus)
I drop the chiseled pear
Standing in smoke filled valleys
(great domains of wingless flight
and the angel’s fleshy gun)
I stamp the houses of withering wax
Bells of siren-teeth (singing to our tomb
refusal’s last becoming)
await the approach of the incendiary children
lighting the moon-shaped beast
Every twisted river pulls down my torn-out hair
to ratless columns by the pyramid’s ghost
(watered basin of the temple stink)
and all the mud clocks in haste
draw their mermaid-feather swords
(wrapped by Dust) to nail them
into the tears of the sea-gull child
The winter web minute

Hope,"You would win me, woo me, win me,
To be your lover, Hope!
You would lure me, charm me, lure me, 
With all your deathless youth!
You would have me worship, adore you, 
Build my life for you;
Mould my moments into hours 
Out of your careless smile!
How you pursue me, woo me, follow,
Like a light-headed girl.
All the world is your willing lover:
What do you want with me?
You are a wanton, lovely, perfect,
A dazzling thing like day,
Draped with silk things,
Tasselled, jewelled,
Hung about with veils;
Painted with sweet lies men have blended 
Of folly and dreams and fear.
You are a wanton, all men’s mistress: 
What do you want with me?
What are your gifts worth, light bestower?
All lips know your kiss.
What is your word worth, soft-tongued liar? 
You have deceived all men.
Why do you follow, woo me, follow,
Like a light-headed girl?
What can I give you? What can you give me? 
What do you want with me?
Painted wanton! Tasselled Houri!
Gay in your dress of shame!
You are all men’s willing mistress.
What do I want with you?","To be your lover, Hope! You would lure me, charm me, lure me. You would have me worship, adore you, build my life for you. How you pursue me, woo me, follow, like a light-headed girl."
Youth,"I must go down,
Down, down,
Below the crusts of things,
Under the shadows,
Into thought-haunted places 
Where few go;
Where the road is broken 
And travelled by monsters,
Truths with hard sphinx-faces.
I must go down 
Into the caves of life,
Into the darknesses,
Deep, deep,
Below the good of things,
Below the evil of things,
Where the calm roots of wisdom creep.
I must tunnel
Under the bloom of dreams,
Under the frame-work of fancies, 
Tunnel alone.
What if I shatter frail things,
Break delicate flowers of myth 
Timorous dreamers have sown?
I must go down
Below narrow roads men have made, 
Below bridging lies men have built, 
Into the caverns of truth.
I know pain is waiting there 
Eager to break me,
But I am strong.
I have faith in my youth.
Living is crusted with lies.
I want life naked,
Laughing and young.
Not fettered, not tamed,
But life unashamed,
With the cry of Desire on her tongue.","I must go down below the crusts of things,                Under the shadows,                Into thought-haunted places                 Where few go;                Where the road is broken                 And travelled by monsters,                 Truths with hard sphinx-faces."
The Grey Thread,"My life is a grey thread,
A thin grey stretched out thread, 
And when I trace its course, I moan: 
How dull! How dead!
But I have gay beads.
A pale one to begin,
A blue one for my painted dreams, 
And one for sin,
Gold with coiled marks,
Like a snake’s skin.
For love an odd bead 
With a deep purple glow;
A green bead for a secret thing 
That few shall know;
And yellow for my thoughts 
That melt like snow.
A red bead for my strength,
And crimson for my hate;
Silver for the songs I sing 
When I am desolate;
And white for my laughter 
That mocks dull fate.
My life is a grey thread 
Stretching through Time’s day;
But I have slipped gay beads on it 
To hide the grey.","My life is a grey thread, a thin grey stretched out thread,                 And when I trace its course, I moan:                 How dull! How dead! But I have gay beads."
Celestial Estrangement,"We have been carried here against our will
Burnt stars
Oceanic gardens
where the clouds are soaked into my eyes
How much sand floats in the teacup of your dreams
The rivers you perceive are those of horses
they carry red water
the odor of imperishable sweat
putrescent human bellies stuffed with revolvers and nuns
At the top of the tower
where hounds part with a pool of water
where one comes only with a flaming lance
where there is no escaping the pain of a horse’s kick
where toy dolls are nailed to the beds
where lovers suck their bodies dry
as harp strings are plucked away
in this hermit world of old gunny sacks and broken heads
we encounter tons of wingless birds","Burnt stars, oceanic gardens, and the smell of imperishable sweat. We have been carried here against our will. The rivers you perceive are those of horses. They carry red water."
Lines from “The Vision of Lazarus”,"Another sate near him, whose harp of gold
Had sounded in the tents of Israel,
His robes were woven from the cloth of Tyre
And golden sandals bound his olive feet.
“I am that David, he whose psalms ye sing
When sounds the timbrel in the plains of Gad.
My garments, washed of every crimson stain,
I am a wearer of the laurel wreath,
My heart as free as when in Bethlehem
I caused the blades of grass to dance with glee;
My soul each eventide goes forth with God,
A humble servant to His mystic will;
And in the morning do I wander wide,
Along the cool of every haunt and vale.
There lies a still brook deep in Heaven’s land
Where milk-white sheep may stray and quench their thirst,
And there I nurse my memories of one
I wooed when in the house of lordly Saul.
A virgin like the rose when glides the wind
From out the Southland in the old year’s noon.”","“I am that David, he whose psalms ye sing                When sounds the timbrel in the plains of Gad.                My garments, washed of every crimson stain,                I am a wearer of the laurel wreath,                My heart as free as when in Bethlehem                I caused the blades of grass to dance with glee’"
A poem for tea heads,"I sit in Lees.     At 11:40 PM with
Jimmy the pusher. He teaches me
Ju Ju.
           Hot on the table before us
shrimp foo yong, rice and mushroom
chow yuke.
         Up the street under the wheels
of a strange car is his stash—The ritual.
We make it.     And have made it.
For months now together after midnight.
Soon I know the fuzz will inter-
rupt will arrest Jimmy and
I shall be placed on probation.
                                               The poem
does not lie to us. We lie under its
law, alive in the glamour of this hour
able to enter into the sacred places
of his dark people, who carry secrets
glassed in their eyes and hide words
          under the roofs of their mouth. ","The poem was written in the early hours of the morning in Lees, Scotland. It was written by a friend of the poet's, who has since died in a car crash."
The New Day,"From a vision red with war I awoke and saw the Prince of
        Peace hovering over No Man’s Land.
Loud the whistles blew and the thunder of cannon was
        drowned by the happy shouting of the people.
From the Sinai that faces Armageddon I heard this chant
        from the throats of white-robed angels:
   Blow your trumpets, little children!
   From the East and from the West,
   From the cities in the valley,
   From God’s dwelling on the mountain,
   Blow your blast that Peace might know
   She is Queen of God’s great army.
   With the crying blood of millions
   We have written deep her name
   In the Book of all the Ages;
   With the lilies in the valley,
   With the roses by the Mersey,
   With the golden flower of Jersey
   We have crowned her smooth young temples.
   Where her footsteps cease to falter
   Golden grain will greet the morning,
   Where her chariot descends
   Shall be broken down the altars
   Of the gods of dark disturbance.
   Nevermore shall men know suffering,
   Nevermore shall women wailing
   Shake to grief the God of Heaven.
   From the East and from the West,
   From the cities in the valley,
   From God’s dwelling on the mountain,
   Little children, blow your trumpets!
From Ethiopia, groaning ’neath her heavy burdens, I heard
        the music of the old slave songs.
I heard the wail of warriors, dusk brown, who grimly
        fought the fight of others in the trenches of Mars.
I heard the plea of blood-stained men of dusk and the
        crimson in my veins leapt furiously.
  Forget not, O my brothers, how we fought
  In No Man’s Land that peace might come again!
  Forget not, O my brothers, how we gave
  Red blood to save the freedom of the world!
  We were not free, our tawny hands were tied;
  But Belgium’s plight and Serbia’s woes we shared
  Each rise of sun or setting of the moon.
  So when the bugle blast had called us forth
  We went not like the surly brute of yore
  But, as the Spartan, proud to give the world
  The freedom that we never knew nor shared.
  These chains, O brothers mine, have weighed us down
  As Samson in the temple of the gods;
  Unloosen them and let us breathe the air
  That makes the goldenrod the flower of Christ.
  For we have been with thee in No Man’s Land,
  Through lake of fire and down to Hell itself;
  And now we ask of thee our liberty,
  Our freedom in the land of Stars and Stripes.
I am glad that the Prince of Peace is hovering over No Man’s Land.","From a vision red with war I awoke and saw the Prince of Peace hovering over No Man’s Land. I heard this chant from the throats of white-robed angels: Blow your trumpets, little children!"

And where is the cloth? 
Dawn is forever the cynic.

Our flesh the eternal moth.

We are brief as apple-blossom
And I am heart-weary with the thought of the end. 
Creation is all. 
The hours are thieves, Time a beggar, 
And we have little to spend. 
I ache for the brush in my hand. 
The thrall of the compliant pigment
Governs my blood. 
I will paint you, Madonna, 
The afterglow in your face; 
I would deify you if I could
With enchantments of color, 
Bind you with fetters of terrible beauty
Fast to my canvas forever, 
Give you the eternality God has denied you, 
Bind you to life with art’s sacred chains
That death cannot sever. 
Love has betrayed us enough with its treacherous wonder: 
Let us go now while we ache with the magic
Or what is the gain? 
Art is our one immortality, 
All we may win from the gods 
In exchange for our labor and pain. ","""Let us leave off loving, Madonna"" is a poem by French poet Frida Ghitis. Ghitis: ""We thought we could make the night a tapestry of passion"""
Fifty Years,"(1863–1913)
On the Fiftieth Anniversary of the Signing of the Emancipation Proclamation
O brothers mine, today we stand
    Where half a century sweeps our ken.
Since God, through Lincoln’s ready hand.
    Struck off our bonds and made us men.
Just fifty years—a winter’s day—
    As runs the history of a race;
Yet, as we look back o’er the way,
    How distant seems our starting place!
Look farther back! Three centuries!
    To where a naked, shivering score,
Snatched from their haunts across the seas,
    Stood, wild-eyed, on Virginia’s shore.
For never let the thought arise
    That we are here on sufferance bare;
Outcasts, asylumed ’neath these skies.
    And aliens without part or share.
This land is ours by right of birth,
    This land is ours by right of toil;
We helped to turn its virgin earth,
    Our sweat is in its fruitful soil.
Where once the tangled forest stood—
    Where flourished once rank weed and thorn—
Behold the path-traced, peaceful wood,
    The cotton white, the yellow corn.
To gain these fruits that have been earned,
    To hold these fields that have been won,
Our arms have strained, our backs have burned,
    Bent bare beneath a ruthless sun.
That Banner which is now the type
    Of victory on field and flood—
Remember, its first crimson stripe
    Was dyed by Attucks’ willing blood.
And never yet has come the cry—
    When that fair flag has been assailed—
For men to do, for men to die.
    That we have faltered or have failed.
We’ve helped to bear it, rent and torn,
    Through many a hot-breath’d battle breeze
Held in our hands, it has been borne
    And planted far across the seas.
And never yet—O haughty Land,
    Let us, at least, for this be praised—
Has one black, treason-guided hand
    Ever against that flag been raised.
Then should we speak but servile words,
    Or shall we hang our heads in shame?
Stand back of new-come foreign hordes,
    And fear our heritage to claim?
No! stand erect and without fear,
    And for our foes let this suffice—
We’ve bought a rightful sonship here,
    And we have more than paid the price.
And yet, my brothers, well I know
    The tethered feet, the pinioned wings,
The spirit bowed beneath the blow,
    The heart grown faint from wounds and stings;
The staggering force of brutish might,
    That strikes and leaves us stunned and dazed;
The long, vain waiting through the night
    To hear some voice for justice raised.
Full well I know the hour when hope
    Sinks dead, and round us everywhere
Hangs stifling darkness, and we grope
    With hands uplifted in despair.
Courage! Look out, beyond, and see
    The far horizon’s beckoning span!
Faith in your God-known destiny!
    We are a part of some great plan.
Because the tongues of Garrison
    And Phillips now are cold in death,
Think you their work can be undone?
    Or quenched the fires lit by their breath?
Think you that John Brown’s spirit stops?
    That Lovejoy was but idly slain?
Or do you think those precious drops
    From Lincoln’s heart were shed in vain?
That for which millions prayed and sighed,
    That for which tens of thousands fought,
For which so many freely died,
    God cannot let it come to naught.","On the Fiftieth Anniversary of the Signing of the Emancipation Proclamation (1863–1913), the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers held a rally in Washington, D.C."
Brothers,"See! There he stands; not brave, but with an air
Of sullen stupor. Mark him well! Is he
Not more like brute than man? Look in his eye!
No light is there; none, save the glint that shines
In the now glaring, and now shifting orbs
Of some wild animal caught in the hunter’s trap.
    How came this beast in human shape and form?
Speak, man!—We call you man because you wear
His shape—How are you thus? Are you not from
That docile, child-like, tender-hearted race
Which we have known three centuries? Not from
That more than faithful race which through three wars
Fed our dear wives and nursed our helpless babes
Without a single breach of trust? Speak out!
    I am, and am not.
            Then who, why are you?

    I am a thing not new, I am as old
As human nature. I am that which lurks,
Ready to spring whenever a bar is loosed;
The ancient trait which fights incessantly
Against restraint, balks at the upward climb;
The weight forever seeking to obey
The law of downward pull—and I am more:
The bitter fruit am I of planted seed;
The resultant, the inevitable end
Of evil forces and the powers of wrong.
    Lessons in degradation, taught and learned,
The memories of cruel sights and deeds,
The pent-up bitterness, the unspent hate
Filtered through fifteen generations have
Sprung up and found in me sporadic life.
In me the muttered curse of dying men,
On me the stain of conquered women, and
Consuming me the fearful fires of lust,
Lit long ago, by other hands than mine.
In me the down-crushed spirit, the hurled-back prayers
Of wretches now long dead—their dire bequests—
In me the echo of the stifled cry
Of children for their bartered mothers’ breasts.
    I claim no race, no race claims me; I am
No more than human dregs; degenerate;
The monstrous offspring of the monster, Sin;
I am—just what I am. . . . The race that fed
Your wives and nursed your babes would do the same
Today, but I—
                  Enough, the brute must die!
Quick! Chain him to that oak! It will resist
The fire much longer than this slender pine.
Now bring the fuel! Pile it ’round him! Wait!
Pile not so fast or high! or we shall lose
The agony and terror in his face.
And now the torch! Good fuel that! the flames
Already leap head-high. Ha! hear that shriek!
And there’s another! Wilder than the first.
Fetch water! Water! Pour a little on
The fire, lest it should burn too fast. Hold so!
Now let it slowly blaze again. See there!
He squirms! He groans! His eyes bulge wildly out,
Searching around in vain appeal for help!
Another shriek, the last! Watch how the flesh
Grows crisp and hangs till, turned to ash, it sifts
Down through the coils of chain that hold erect
The ghastly frame against the bark-scorched tree.
    Stop! to each man no more than one man’s share.
You take that bone, and you this tooth; the chain—
Let us divide its links; this skull, of course,
In fair division, to the leader comes.
    And now his fiendish crime has been avenged;
Let us back to our wives and children.—Say,
What did he mean by those last muttered words,
“Brothers in spirit, brothers in deed are we”?","I am that which lurks, ready to spring whenever a bar is loosed. I claim no race, no race claims me; I am no more than human dregs; degenerate. I am the monstrous offspring of the monster, Sin;I am just what I am."
Stepping into the Sea,"You let me, your stepmother, 
Take your hand to walk  
into the surf, let 
slippery seaweed wrap  
around your ankles  
like emerald ribbons. 

We step on the edge  
of lacey waves that feel 
like butter on hot skin.  

You hold back, your mother’s 
fear of the sea, fear of me,  
sways you. She warns you  
Yemaya, the Santeria god, 
will swallow you into the sea 
here in Puerto Rico, la isla bonita,
land of your Borinquen bloodline. 

I tip the balance, study Santeria,
pin a benevolent picture  
of Yemaya on my bulletin board, 
so she will know who we are. 

Queen of the Ocean, Mother, 
Yemaya, savior of sailors,  
Spirit of moonlight, 
She will protect you, I swear, 
as she does sailors in stormy seas. 

Tall, lean in silver drapery,  
she shows up in New Orleans hoodoo, 
In Brazil, her wizened face, a walnut, 
In Venezuela, I find  
a child-size likeness of her,  
but am afraid to bring it home, 
its eyes too lifelike. 

Today, we are in Puerto Rico.
We weave our fingers together, 
dig our toes into the sea floor 
sandy and firm underfoot, 
enter the sea of your ancestors.","Yemaya, the Santeria god,  will swallow you into the sea, warns the stepmother. Yemaya is the savior of sailors and the spirit of moonlight. She will protect you in stormy seas, I swear."
We,"         Like that day in February—crisp, sharp cloudless
           it’s like that today when winter refuses to fade.

       The sheets over and under you, creaseless like the sky.

     I bend over your hospital bed, release the railing between us
                        in silence we call mercy into the room.","Winter refuses to fade. The sheets over and under you, creaseless like the sky. I bend over your hospital bed, release the railing between us and call mercy into the room."
O Black and Unknown Bards,"O black and unknown bards of long ago.
How came your lips to touch the sacred fire?
How, in your darkness, did you come to know
The power and beauty of the minstrel’s lyre?
Who first from midst his bonds lifted his eyes?
Who first from out the still watch, lone and long,
Feeling the ancient faith of prophets rise
Within his dark-kept soul, burst into song?
Heart of what slave poured out such melody
As “Steal away to Jesus”? On its strains
His spirit must have nightly floated free,
Though still about his hands he felt his chains.
Who heard great “Jordan roll”? Whose starward eye
Saw chariot “swing low”? And who was he
That breathed that comforting, melodic sigh,
“Nobody knows de trouble I see”?
What merely living clod, what captive thing,
Could up toward God through all its darkness grope,
And find within its deadened heart to sing
These songs of sorrow, love and faith, and hope?
How did it catch that subtle undertone,
That note in music heard not with the ears?
How sound the elusive reed so seldom blown,
Which stirs the soul or melts the heart to tears.
Not that great German master in his dream
Of harmonies that thundered amongst the stars
At the creation, ever heard a theme
Nobler than “Go down, Moses.” Mark its bars
How like a mighty trumpet-call they stir
The blood. Such are the notes that men have sung
Going to valorous deeds; such tones there were
That helped make history when Time was young.
There is a wide, wide wonder in it all,
That from degraded rest and servile toil
The fiery spirit of the seer should call
These simple children of the sun and soil.
O black slave singers, gone, forgot, unfamed,
You—you alone, of all the long, long line
Of those who’ve sung untaught, unknown, unnamed,
Have stretched out upward, seeking the divine.
You sang not deeds of heroes or of kings;
No chant of bloody war, no exulting pean
Of arms-won triumphs; but your humble strings
You touched in chord with music empyrean.
You sang far better than you knew; the songs
That for your listeners’ hungry hearts sufficed
Still live,—but more than this to you belongs:
You sang a race from wood and stone to Christ.","O black slave singers, gone, forgot, unfamed, you alone, of all the long, long line of those who’ve sung untaught, unknown, unnamed, have stretched out upward, seeking the divine. O black and unknown bards of long ago. How came your lips to touch the sacred fire?"
Transformation & Escape,"1
I reached heaven and it was syrupy.
It was oppressively sweet.
Croaking substances stuck to my knees.
Of all substances St. Michael was stickiest.
I grabbed him and pasted him on my head.   
I found God a gigantic fly paper.
I stayed out of his way.
I walked where everything smelled of burnt chocolate.   
Meanwhile St. Michael was busy with his sword   
hacking away at my hair.
I found Dante standing naked in a blob of honey.   
Bears were licking his thighs.
I snatched St. Michael’s sword
and quartered myself in a great circular adhesive.   
My torso fell upon an elastic equilibrium.
As though shot from a sling
my torso whizzed at God fly paper.
My legs sank into some unimaginable sog.
My head, though weighed with the weight of St. Michael,   
did not fall.
Fine strands of multi-colored gum
suspended it there.
My spirit stopped by my snared torso.
I pulled! I yanked! Rolled it left to right!
It bruised! It softened! It could not free!
The struggle of an Eternity!
An Eternity of pulls! of yanks!
Went back to my head,
St. Michael had sucked dry my brainpan!
Skull!
My skull!
Only skull in heaven!
Went to my legs.
St. Peter was polishing his sandals with my knees!   
I pounced upon him!
Pummeled his face in sugar in honey in marmalade!   
Under each arm I fled with my legs!
The police of heaven were in hot pursuit!
I hid within the sop of St. Francis.
Gasping in the confectionery of his gentility   
I wept, caressing my intimidated legs.
2
They caught me.
They took my legs away.
They sentenced me in the firmament of an ass.
The prison of an Eternity!
An Eternity of labor! of hee-haws!
Burdened with the soiled raiment of saints
I schemed escape.
Lugging ampullae its daily fill
I schemed escape.
I schemed climbing impossible mountains.
I schemed under the Virgin’s whip.
I schemed to the sound of celestial joy.
I schemed to the sound of earth,
the wail of infants,   
the groans of men,   
the thud of coffins.   
I schemed escape.
God was busy switching the spheres from hand to hand.   
The time had come.
I cracked my jaws.   
Broke my legs.
Sagged belly-flat on plow
on pitchfork
on scythe.
My spirit leaked from the wounds.
A whole spirit pooled.
I rose from the carcass of my torment.   
I stood in the brink of heaven.
And I swear that Great Territory did quake   
when I fell, free.
 ",The author describes his escape from hell. He describes how he was stuck to a giant fly paper by St. Michael. He says he broke his legs and was caught by the police.
My Love,"My love has hair
Like midnight,
But midnight fades to dawn.
My love has eyes

But dew-fall dies at a breath.

Like life’s all,
But life’s all fades in death.","My love has hair like midnight, but midnight fades to dawn. My love has eyes like starlight, but starlight fades in morn. my love has a voice like dew-fall, but dew falls at a breath."

from “Pink Waves”,"5
it was a wave, it was infectious
an occasional moment reveals nothing but a passing light
extent to which i breathe your facts
it’s haptic; it’s your membrane; it’s material clatter
sliding between your stargazing hoax and flesh
and then somebody steals your wild you
and names it

a quiet neck is often indifferent to the mismeasured noise of the world 
substrata lower than the territory concedes
sharp pointed arrows indicate the lack of an end

Bird in Hand,"Being asked to move into time

The skin wrinkles

One Girl,"translated by Dante Gabriel Rossetti
                                         I.
Like the sweet apple which reddens upon the topmost bough,
A-top on the topmost twig, which the pluckers forgot, somehow,—
Forgot it not, nay, but got it not, for none could get it till now.
                                         II.
Like the wild hyacinth flower which on the hills is found.
Which the passing feet of the shepherds for ever tear and wound,
Until the purple blossom is trodden into the ground.","Dante Gabriel Rossetti's poem was written in the first half of the 18th century. It is about the sweet apple which reddens upon the topmost bough, and how the pluckers forgot it."

"A Shropshire Lad, XXX","Others, I am not the first,
Have willed more mischief than they durst:
If in the breathless night I too
Shiver now, ’tis nothing new.
More than I, if truth were told,
Have stood and sweated hot and cold,
And through their reins in ice and fire
Fear contended with desire.
Agued once like me were they,
But I like them shall win my way
Lastly to the bed of mould
Where there’s neither heat nor cold.
But from my grave across my brow
Plays no wind of healing now,
And fire and ice within me fight
Beneath the suffocating night.","""I like them shall win my way to the bed of mould where there’s neither heat nor cold,"" he writes. ""Fire and ice within me fight for my life"""
There Is a Black Fly in Your Chardonnay,"Outside, I have never been lonesome,
Always a fence, a plank, an eyebrow in the ocean,
A baby received in a house, anything tall is a tree.
The sky rearranges itself in the desert;
The sky rearranges itself in the water;
The sky rearranges itself while I am in the sky.
How lucky I thought I was to see the street lights turn on,
Clouds like rows of planting, mistakes we make and agree to continue,
A view of the river, my rock in the glade,
Bigger, relatively, and still, until,
I pull my lover open like a zipper,
I drag a trowel through them,
I lick the paint off my own stick,
I have a cold back and wet ankles.
Later, a slow moon laboring over the hillside;
Later, the fog reflects the moon;
Later, my blood is sucked and I itch.
Will we will we ever find home? 
The car calls us in the distance,
To walk the stairs, to take off my shoes, to stand 
Wringing hands, scratching grass blades on toenails. 
You are starting to see things we could never see before like:
You have been born,
Or how I waited a whole year for September,
A piece of fruit,
A source of fire,
An edge, an excuse on a small scrap of paper,
The woods in my mouth.
It is so hot today like yesterday and the day before.","The book is about a young man's journey through the desert and the sea. It is written in the first person voice of the author, and is published by Penguin Books."

Sweet Are The Dreams on The Breeze-Blown Strand,"Sestine Enchainée
When autumn cloudlets fleck the sky
    Straying southward like birds o’er the sea,
      When the flickering sunlight on the dunes
          Is pale, as seagrasses kissed by the spray,
           Seagrasses that knew the summer of yesterday–
             Sweet are the dreams on the breeze-blown strand!
Sweet are the dreams on the breeze-blown strand!
   When cloud skiffs skim athwart the sky
       And like a phantom of yesterday
          The light house shimmers out to sea
             Pale as the sand and the sea-worn spray
               And the straggling sunlight on the dunes.
Like straggling sunlight on the dunes,
  Like opal surges that wash the strand
    With briny fragrance, adoom with the spray,
        Like wander-birds that career the sky
          To flowerlit isles of some Southern sea-
            Such are the dreams of yesterday!
Alas, our dreams of yesterday,
   Frail as the fragrance of the dunes,
     Vain as dark jewels of the sea
        Cast up on some glimmering strand,
          They vanish like cloud sails on the sky,
             Pale as seagrasses frowsed by the spray.  
Pale as seagrasses kissed by the spray,
   Is all this life of yesterday,
    All our longings for clear blue skies
       For the low cool plash on autumn dunes,
          All our musings on tide-left strands
             While birds wing southward o’er the sea.
Like birds winging southward o’er the sea
   Scattered in air-like wasteful spray,
     Sea-fancies fading on lonesome strands
       Weary of storm drifts of yesterday,
           Thus our thoughts on the sea-scooped dunes
              When autumn cloudlets fleck the sky.
Oh, autumn-sea under a cloud-flecked sky
   As caressed are thy dunes with opal spray
      So shimmer in dreams on the breeze-blown strand

Love By The Sea #2,"The waves have lost their silvery note,
   White birds of dreams o’er the dim plain start,
       Through the mist is gliding a phantom bark––
          What made love open its eyes and part!
Where are the sweet names we whispered low,
    Were they carried away by the breeze?
        The vain words which from our lips did flow
           Are they buried forever in dismal seas?
             And the kisses that rained on your face
                Has nothing remained of their ardent glow?
                   The night holds nothing but a cold embrace,
                      The sun of our love sank low.
Only the note of the seabird rings
   Through the dim realm of night and mist,
      Not a breath of our past love clings
         To this sea of faded amethyst,
           Even the wind pauses in space
              And refuses to caress our lips;
                 Alas, our love was of fleeting pace
                    Like the visions of seafaring ships.
Like the flash of a meteor’s flight,––
  Know we whither its glow has flown;
      Its sped across heaven with radiant light
       And vanished in worlds unknown––
          So the sweet hours have passed away
            Like flowers that on the sand-dunes grow,
               Like waves that die in a wreath of spray
                  When bitter winds over the shoreland blow.",The sun of our love sank low. The waves have lost their silvery note. White birds of dreams o’er the dim plain start are gliding a phantom bark.
Dawn-Flowers,"to Maurice Maeterlinck
Weird phantoms rise in the dawn-winds blow,
   In the land of shadows the dawn-flowers grow;
      The night-worn moon yields her weary glow
         To the morn-rays that over the dream-waste flow.
Oh, to know what the dawn-wind murmurs
   In chapels of pines to the ashen moons;
What the forest-well whispers to dale and dell
   With her singular, reticent runes;
To know the plaint of each falling leaf
   As it whirls across the autumnal plain;
To know the dreams of the desolate shore
   As sails, like ghosts, pass o’er the dawnlit main!
                     To know, oh, to know
       Why all life’s strains have the same refrain
                              As of rain,
              Beating sadly against the window pane.
      We do not know and we can not know,
      And all that is left for us here below
      (Since ""songs and singers are out of date"")
      And the muses have met with a similar fate)
            Is to flee to the land of shadows and dreams,
                    Where the dawn-flowers grow
                     And the dawn-winds blow,
            As morn-rays over life’s dream-waste of flow
              To drown the moon in their ambient glow.

Oh, gray dawn-poet of Flanders,
   Though in this life we ne’er may meet,
      I'll linger where thy dream-maids wander
         To strew these dawn-flowers at their feet.","Maurice Maeterlinck wrote a poem about the land of shadows and dreams in Flanders. The poem is called ""Weird phantoms rise in the dawn-winds blow"" and is written in the style of Flanders poet, Flanders Poem."
Twilight Hours,"                                    I
The colors of the rainbow are fading in the silent
      and distant West, and the heartache of
      twilight trembles within my aching breast.
   For the light of my love has faded like sunbeams
         in the West, and the color of twilight will
         tremble forever in my breast.
                                   II
I think of thy kindness often, when lonesome I feel
      and cold, I have not forgotten our childhood,
      nor your loving words of old.
   And still my sweetest songs of life are floating
         in dreams to thee, like whisperings at eventide,
         across a clouded sea.
                                   III
We two are sitting in the bark, and listen to the
      wavelets’ play, the shore is melting in the
      dark, day’s echoes silently decay.
   Oh life, with all thy hopes so fair, wilt thou
         too float away, like visions rising in the
         air that greet the parting day!
                                   IV
She stands amidst the roses, and tears dart from her
      eyes that like the fragrant roses her soul
      must fade and die.
   He stares at the twilight ocean on the shore of a
         foreign land, a faded rose is trembling
         within his soft white hand.
                                   V
The rushes whisper softly, the sounds of silence wake,
      large flowers like sad remembrance float
      on the dark green lake.
   Were life but like the waters, so bright and calm
         and deep, and love like floating flowers
         that on the surface meet.
                                   VI
The naked trees of autumn grope shivering through
      twilight’s gloom, athwart the whispering branches
      its dying embers loom.
   I dream of life’s defoliation, as I watch with
         silent dread, leaf after leaf departing, like
         hopes long withered and dead.
                                  VII
In haunting hours of twilight dreams restless the
      turbulent sea, and heaves her white wanton
      bosom in endless mystery.
   Dream on, dream on, titanic queen, beloved sea, at
         thy wanton breast, I would find rest
         in endless mystery.",The colors of the rainbow are fading in the silent and distant West. The heartache of twilight trembles within my aching breast. The light of my love has faded like sunbeams in the West.
Love By The Sea #1,"Far away from the murmuring town,
   In the region of sand and sea,
     Love has surprised us on the down–
        Love has surprised you and me–
           In this realm where sea-kissed grasses sway,
            Where winds at nightfall sadly moan,
               Where sea-gulls sing there plaintive lay.
                   And waves croon in minor monotone.
No flower grows in this land of dreams,
   No human habitation far or near
     Illumines the scene with a reddish gleam,
        All around is desolate and drear;
           Nothing but weeds and greyish sand–
            Yet the sea seems to say in an undertone;
               Until dawn whitens this wind-blown strand,
                   The treasures of night are all thy own!
And like waves that softly shoreward creep,
   Love draws us nigh as the hours pass,
     Thy breath is like wind in the weft of the grass;
        I feel thy bosom ebb and tide––
           Its paleness resembles the moonlit sea––
               And as sea and heaven together glide
                   Let thy sweetness be lost in me.
Do not be startled at the seabird’s cry
   Nor at the wind’s relentless blast
     Too soon the kiss on our lips will die,
        Alas, the joys of Venus never last!  
           Like flowers that droop on the sunburnt sward
               Our love must needs wither and fade,
                  Like blossoms that ars carried seawards
                     By the wind from some sleepy glade.
One joys of Venus never last,
   Love is naught but some dreamland lore,
      And as the hours are ebbing fast
         Our dream like seaweed, will be left on the shore;
            Already the cup of the autumn moon
               Floods with her gold the distant West,
                 The bitterness of life will dawn too soon,
                    Forlorn lies the sea-gull’s last year’s nest.
                         Perchance, some other autumn eye,
                         May greet us on this barren wold,
                         Not arm in arm, alone and fain,
                         Desirous of the days of old.","Love has surprised us on the down, says the poet. The joys of Venus never last, he writes. Love is naught but some dreamland lore, he adds."
Sic Vita,"Heart free, hand free,
    Blue above, brown under,
All the world to me
    Is a place of wonder.
Sun shine, moon shine,
    Stars, and winds a-blowing.
All into this heart of mine
    Flowing, flowing, flowing!
Mind free, step free,
    Days to follow after,
Joys of life sold to me
    For the price of laughter.
Girl’s love, man’s love,
    Love of work and duty,
Just a will of God’s to prove
    Beauty, beauty, beauty!","The song is about the joys of life, and the price of laughter. It was written by British singer-songwriter David Walliams. The song is called ""The World to me"""
Sandy Star,"I
Sculptured Worship
The zones of warmth around his heart,
    No alien airs had crossed;
But he awoke one morn to feel
    The magic numbness of autumnal frost.
His thoughts were a loose skein of threads,
    And tangled emotions, vague and dim;
And sacrificing what he loved
    He lost the dearest part of him.
In sculptured worship now he lives,
    His one desire a prisoned ache;
If he can never melt again
    His very heart will break.
II
Laughing It Out
He had a whim and laughed it out
    Upon the exit of a chance;
He floundered in a sea of doubt—
    If life was real—or just romance.
Sometimes upon his brow would come
    A little pucker of defiance;
He totalled in a word the sum
    Of all man made of facts and science.
And then a hearty laugh would break,
    A reassuring shrug of shoulder;
And we would from his fancy take
    A faith in death which made life bolder.
III
Exit
No, his exit by the gate
    Will not leave the wind ajar;
He will go when it is late
    With a misty star.
One will call, he cannot see;
    One will call, he will not hear;
He will take no company
    Nor a hope or fear.
We shall smile who loved him so—
    They who gave him hate will weep;
But for us the winds will blow
    Pulsing through his sleep.
IV
The Way
He could not tell the way he came,
    Because his chart was lost:
Yet all his way was paved with flame
    From the bourne he crossed.
He did not know the way to go,
    Because he had no map:
He followed where the winds blow,—
    And the April sap.
He never knew upon his brow
    The secret that he bore,—
And laughs away the mystery now
    The dark’s at his door.
V
Onus Probandi
No more from out the sunset,
    No more across the foam,
No more across the windy hills
    Will Sandy Star come home.
He went away to search it
    With a curse upon his tongue:
And in his hand the staff of life,
    Made music as it swung.
I wonder if he found it,
    And knows the mystery now—
Our Sandy Star who went away,
    With the secret on his brow.",Iggy Pop wrote a song called ‘Sculptured Worship’ It is about a man who lost the dearest part of him. The song is set to music.
Sandy Star and Willie Gee,"Sandy Star and Willie Gee,

And you’ll see into my heart.",Sandy Star and Willie Gee are two of the most popular songs of the 20th century. The song was written for the film version of the

Trying Too Hard to Write a Poem Sitting on the Beach,"Planted among driftwood
I watch the tide go out
It pulls the sundown with it
& across this scene & against the wind
Man on a motorbike white crash-helmet
His young son rides the gas tank before him
Slows down for the creek mouth
& not too fast up the beach north
Flat dull whistle buoy heard again
and though the wind is right the bell buoy is inaudible
Fat seagull picks at a new hake skeleton
Choosily—not hungry walks away
Returns a moment later,
Room for a few more bites inside
Here comes a family of five
Man prodding with a stick whatever the children test
                          with their fingers
Mama is bundled up naturally cold & yellow plastic bucket
Complaining a little “. . . kind of a long way from the car . . .”
The children explore ahead the beach goes on forever & they
Will see it all this evening they aren’t tired
Motorbike man coming back slows down for them
               & for the creek mouth

Move south stretching rivers & islands of blue
Fine moving sheets & shafts of light on the water horizon

The Feet of Judas,"Christ washed the feet of Judas!

Yet all his lurking sin was bare to him,
His bargain with the priest, and more than this,
In Olivet, beneath the moonlight dim,
Aforehand knew and felt his treacherous kiss.
Christ washed the feet of Judas!
And so ineffable his love ’twas meet,
That pity fill his great forgiving heart,
And tenderly to wash the traitor’s feet,
Who in his Lord had basely sold his part.
Christ washed the feet of Judas!
And thus a girded servant, self-abased,
Taught that no wrong this side the gate of heaven
Was ever too great to wholly be effaced,
And though unasked, in spirit be forgiven.
And so if we have ever felt the wrong
Of Trampled rights, of caste, it matters not,
What e’er the soul has felt or suffered long,
Oh, heart! this one thing should not be forgot:

At the Lindens Shiver in Autumn Dreams,"The fields lie wrapt in autumn dreams, 
   Beneath the dim, blue vault of night, 
     The moon, like a bark on sluggish streams, 
         Spreads soft her sail of silver light. 

Beneath the blue, dim vault of night, 
  With the way-worn notes of joy and care, 
     Across the sea of the moon's pale light
       Dark flocks of birds flap the silent air.

Fantastic shapes with wings outspread,

Their rustling wings are shimmering bright
   As in myriad swarms they are passing by, 
      Like pageants of some Valpurgis night,

Wheeling their flight whence summer has flown, 
    Like dreams and hopes long gone by, 
      Like songs of love our youth has known,

Voyages V,"Meticulous, past midnight in clear rime,   
Infrangible and lonely, smooth as though cast   
Together in one merciless white blade—
The bay estuaries fleck the hard sky limits.
—As if too brittle or too clear to touch!   
The cables of our sleep so swiftly filed,
Already hang, shred ends from remembered stars.   
One frozen trackless smile... What words   
Can strangle this deaf moonlight? For we
Are overtaken. Now no cry, no sword   
Can fasten or deflect this tidal wedge,
Slow tyranny of moonlight, moonlight loved   
And changed... “There’s
Nothing like this in the world,” you say,   
Knowing I cannot touch your hand and look   
Too, into that godless cleft of sky
Where nothing turns but dead sands flashing.

In all the argosy of your bright hair I dreamed   
Nothing so flagless as this piracy.

Draw in your head, alone and too tall here.   
Your eyes already in the slant of drifting foam;   
Your breath sealed by the ghosts I do not know:   
Draw in your head and sleep the long way home.",The author writes of a dream he had with his late-night partner. He describes a night in which the moonlight has been overtaken by the tide of the night.
Caught Sight,"1
An unexpected storm puts out smoldering forest roots, ending fire season early.
Water persists through unseeable spaces between glass and window frames. Water’s tears displace dust, leaving streaks down the walls of the subdivided apartment.
I have little time to feel.
The pants I wear to work and work alone drape perpetually over the yellow chair.
The hills turn a generous green.
Weekends are for my new love. Twice we trailed the periphery of the zoo to lunch beside the wolves for free.
Once we followed a deer trail to an abandoned barn. We used the corners of the corrugated wall as steps to dangle inward at the square opening.
We hardly breathed at two owls above the meeting of wood beams. I only saw their silent backs as they fled—our presences forcing them into midday light.

A neighbor through the wall plays classical piano less and less over the months.
Another learns guitar through a merciless repetition of top fifty alternative hits.
I can admit I’m unwell. I wouldn’t call a web colorless, shifting from invisible to everything. 
The yellow mullein bloom corkscrews, searching for sun.
I turn from the sense that I know myself to the sense that I had some friends who knew me well, though I didn’t know myself to them. 
An unhatched chick turns its right eye to its outer shell. The right eye develops to find food up close. The left eye, wing-tucked, develops to see distant threat.

Fire Dragon,"for Linus Chao
Lao Ye sits at the edge of hala trees
where rolls of brown and yellow 
seas eat thorns of dried lauhala. 
He seeks Tai Nainai, finds 
a fishing canoe instead.

from the Qi of a horsehair brush.

Lao Ye sits on the back of the fire dragon, 
smokes incense from Shandong to Hawaiʻi.
He stretches from cloud to ka nahele,
paints around the white of sky,
with blue, purple, and red.

"To the ""Flat Iron""","On roof and street, on park and pier, 
The springtide sun shines soft and white, 
Where the “Flat Iron,” gaunt, austere, 
Lifts its huge tiers in limpid light. 

   From the city’s stir and madd’ning roar
   Your monstrous shape scars in massive flight, 
    And ’mid the breezes the ocean bore
    Your windows flame in the sunset light. 

        Lonely and lithe, o’er the nocturnal city’s 
        Flickering flames, you proudly tower, 
        Like some ancient, giant monolith, 
        Girt with the stars and mists that lower. 

All else we see fade fast and disappear, 
Only your prow-like form looms gaunt, austere, 
As in a sea of fog, now veiled, now clear. 

      Iron structure of the time, 
         Rich, in showing no pretense, 
           Fair, in frugalness sublime, 
        emblem staunch of common sense, 
            Well may you smile over Gotham’s vast domain, 
              As dawn greets your pillars with roseate flame, 
               For future ages will proclaim 
                      Your beauty, boldly, 
                              Without shame. ","Gotham City is the most famous city in the United States. The city is named after the Flat Iron, which was built in the early 20th century. Gotham City was the site of the first Batman movie in 1989."
The Gift of India,"Is there aught you need that my hands withhold,
Rich gifts of raiment or grain or gold?
Lo! I have flung to the East and West
Priceless treasures torn from my breast,
And yielded the sons of my stricken womb
To the drum-beats of duty, the sabres of doom.
Gathered like pearls in their alien graves
Silent they sleep by the Persian waves,
Scattered like shells on Egyptian sands,
They lie with pale brows and brave, broken hands,
They are strewn like blossoms mown down by chance
On the blood-brown meadows of Flanders and France.
Can ye measure the grief of the tears I weep
Or compass the woe of the watch I keep?
Or the pride that thrills thro’ my heart’s despair
And the hope that comforts the anguish of prayer?
And the far sad glorious vision I see
Of the torn red banners of Victory?
When the terror and tumult of hate shall cease
And life be refashioned on anvils of peace,
And your love shall offer memorial thanks
To the comrades who fought in your dauntless ranks,
And you honour the deeds of the deathless ones
Remember the blood of thy martyred sons!","Priceless treasures torn from my breast have yielded the sons of my stricken womb. They lie with pale brows and brave, broken hands, strewn like blossoms on Egyptian sands."
Dusk Song,"The garden is very quiet to-night,
The dusk has gone with the Evening Star,
And out on the bay a lone ship light
Makes a silver pathway over the bar
Where the sea sings low.
I follow the light with an earnest eye,
Creeping along to the thick far-away,
Until it fell in the depths of the deep, dark sky
With the haunting dream of the dusk of day
And its lovely glow.
Long nights, long nights and the whisperings of new ones,
Flame the line of the pathway down to the sea
With the halo of new dreams and the hallow of old ones,
And they bring magic light to my love reverie
And a lover’s regret.
Tender sorrow for loss of a soft murmured word,
Tender measure of doubt in a faint, aching heart,
Tender listening for wind-songs in the tree heights heard
When you and I were of the dusks a part,
Are with me yet.
I pray for faith to the noble spirit of Space,
I sound the cosmic depths for the measure of glory
Which will bring to this earth the imperishable race
Of whom Beauty dreamed in the soul-toned story
The Prophets told.
Silence and love and deep wonder of stars
Dust-silver the heavens from west to east,
From south to north, and in a maze of bars
Invisible I wander far from the feast,
As night grows old.
Half blind is my vision I know to the truth,
My ears are half deaf to the voice of the tear
That touches the silences as Autumn’s ruth
Steals through the dusks of each returning year,
A goodly friend.
The Autumn, then Winter and wintertime’s grief!
But the weight of the snow is the glistening gift
Which loving brings to the rose and its leaf,
For the days of the roses glow in the drift
And never end.
The moon has come.   Wan and pallid is she.
The spell of half memories, the touch of half tears,
And the wounds of worn passions she brings to me
With all the tremor of the far-off years
And their mad wrong.
Yet the garden is very quiet to-night,
The dusk has long gone with the Evening Star,
And out on the bay the moon’s wan light
Lays a silver pathway beyond the bar,
Dear heart, pale and long.",The poem was written in the early hours of the morning. It is set in the garden of a small village in the south of France. The author describes the garden as 'quiet to-night'

Salt-water creatures unliving in strip towns
along the Atlantic floor between Africa and Americas.

storms against thick planted cargo ship masts, moored,
sunk both strange and familiar men and still more came
As when god of disease sent rats to bite the soft beige
of shipmate cheeks, urinate on their food rations, release
fleas into matted slicks of oily hair and still more came
As when god of war descended incarnate and slit throats
into revolt, sometimes with no survivors on either side,
and still more came
As when god of disease blew foul air on sweaty faces
in the cargo hold, waited off portside for that shipment
to stagger to the deck, inhale a first chest-full of fresh air,
be lowered to the sea, delivered into the arms of god
of crossroads, and rushed back to healers on the continent
(instead, they were tossed stiff, breathless into the deep)
and still more came as when the Huntsfolk, guards of the surface
and the Merfolk, guards of the deep, stood watch over each
wind-tossed, diseased, starving, and revolting ship,
called to each piece of cargo by name, welcomed the leap overboard

It Was Not Fate,"It was not fate which overtook me,
Rather a wayward, wilful wind
That blew hot for awhile
And then, as the even shadows came, blew cold.
What pity it is that a man grown old in life’s dreaming
Should stop, e’en for a moment, to look into a woman’s eyes.
And I forgot!
Forgot that one’s heart must be steeled against the east wind.
Life and death alike come out of the East:
Life as tender as young grass,
Death as dreadful as the sight of clotted blood.
I shall go back into the darkness,
Not to dream but to seek the light again.
I shall go by paths, mayhap,
On roads that wind around the foothills
Where the plains are bare and wild
And the passers-by come few and far between.
I want the night to be long, the moon blind.
The hills thick with moving memories,
And my heart beating a breathless requiem
For all the dead days I have lived.
When the Dawn comes—Dawn, deathless, dreaming—
I shall will that my soul must be cleansed of hate,
I shall pray for strength to hold children close to my heart,
I shall desire to build houses where the poor will know
       shelter, comfort, beauty.
And then may I look into a woman’s eyes
And find holiness, love and the peace which passeth understanding.","""It was not fate which overtook me, rather a wayward, wilful wind"" ""I shall go back into the darkness, not to dream but to seek the light again"" ""My heart beating a breathless requiem for all the dead days I have lived"""

By Your Hand,"for Deon
I peer at the ridges of your palm
rested along the crevice of mine,
while tracing your jagged vasculature
with a delicate press of my finger,
and I explore every uneven wrinkle,
every pronounced callus, every rounded
mole like it is the hilly, stone-ridden
backyard of my childhood home in Mongmong.
I know this place. I have been here
before. I read the swirls inscribed
into your firm dark skin, sound out
each node and connecting branch,
sew syllables into words that spell
out gima’: home.
I raise your hand transposed against
the evening sky, clear of clouds, and I
can find the constellations within you.
Did you know our forefathers did this at sea—
placed their arm to the heavens to translate
the stars? Master navigators of the open ocean,
yet you, my love, are more than a map; I dare
not fold nor decipher your complexity. You
are the beloved, longed-for destination at the end
of the journey, the place that our ancestors craved
return, the reason for the expedition—refuge,
promise, hope. You are home.","Deon: I explore every uneven wrinkle, every pronounced callus, every rounded mole like it is the hilly, stone-ridden backyard of my childhood home in Mongmong.

the memories nimble, place your fingers inside the mouth of her hair.

A Road for Loss,"translated from the Arabic by Fady Joudah
Like the rest of you,
I thought of escape.
But I have a fear of flying,
a phobia of congested bridges
and traffic accidents,
of learning a new language.
My plan’s for a simple getaway,
a small departure:
pack my children in a suitcase
and to a new place we go.
Directions confuse me:
there’s no forest in this city,
no desert either.
Do you know a road for loss
that doesn’t end
in a settlement?
I thought of befriending animals,
the adorable type, as substitutes
for my children’s electronic toys,
but I want a place for getting lost.
My children will grow,
their questions will multiply,
and I don’t tell lies,
but teachers distort my words.
I don’t hold grudges,
but neighbors are always nosy.
I don’t rebuke,
but enemies kill.
My children grow older,
and no one’s thought yet
to broadcast the final news hour,
shut down religious channels,
seal school roofs and walls,
end torture.
I don’t dare to speak.
Whatever I speak of happens.
I don’t want to speak.
I’d rather be lost.","""I have a fear of flying, a phobia of congested bridges and traffic accidents"" ""I want a place for getting lost"" ""Whatever I speak of happens. I don’t want to speak. I'd rather be lost"""
Mothers Arrange Their Aches at Night,"Translated by Fady Joudah
Joint pain, high sugar,
rheumatic ailments,
a boy who missed school because of a cold:
mothers feel sadness for mysterious reasons,
like sadness over other mothers
who stand in public streets
holding photos of their sons’
well-groomed faces
with sideburns and mustaches,
waiting for the cameras to capture them
and their chapped hands.
Mothers who hold up the house beams,
open windows,
air out carpets on roofs,
expel moths from the hearts
of abandoned mattresses
in case a visitor arrives.
Mothers, who stipulate
no conditions for return,
arrange their aches at night
and wash their daughters’ hair with oil,
in bed they toss and turn.
And when they fall asleep
they snore
and give the house a name and a voice.",Mothers of children who have been born with congenital defects are often left to their own devices. They are often unable to work or care for their children because of their health problems.
You Can’t,"Translated by Fady Joudah
They will fall in the end, 
those who say you can’t. 
It’ll be age or boredom that overtakes them, 
or lack of imagination. 
Sooner or later, all leaves fall to the ground. 
You can be the last leaf. 
You can convince the universe 
that you pose no threat 
to the tree’s life. ","They will fall in the end, those who say you can’t. It’ll be age or boredom that overtakes them. You can be the last leaf."
Some Microbes,"Translated by Fady Joudah
Some microbes 
liberate themselves 
from the body they’ve settled in
by suicide.
They whisper in your ear
to smash your car into a wall
or blow up a pier.
Even madness, 
our singular claim to superiority,
is nothing more than a vitamin deficiency. 
All this and you still doubt
how pink
my nipples are
after I’ve told you they’re pink.
Microbes whisper Vitamin D
to me, whisper amino acids,
yellow plasma, and a man
that morphine takes away 
as oxygen grabs him by his arm.
I touch myself to live free
of arterial disease and gastric ailments.
I counter microbes
with supplements 
that give me headaches
and good standing in a middle class
that guards itself against a painful death.

in the cold
of forgetting.

The Ascent,"Into the air like dandelion seed
Or like the spiral of lark into the light
Or fountain into sun. All former sight
From hill or mountain was a mere hint of this.
We gain a new dimension. What had been
Our prison, where we crawled and clung like ants,
We spurn, and vision lying far beneath us.
O naked shape of earth! What green mammelles,
Arteries of gold and silver, turquoise flanks,
Plush jungles now are patterned! As we bank,
The earth tilts; we are level and aloof,
And it spins on and on among the stars.
We poise in air, hang motionless, and see
The planet turns with slow grace of a dancer.","The planet turns with slow grace of a dancer, the author writes. The planet spins on and on among the stars, says the author."
Memorial Wreath,"(It is a little-known fact that 200,000 Negroes fought

Love and remembrance blossom in our hearts

And bought our freedom with your lives.

These fiery roses, white-hot cotton flowers
And violets bluer than cool northern skies
You dreamed of stooped in burning prison fields
When liberty was only a faint north star,
Not a bright flower planted by your hands
Reaching up hardy nourished with your blood.
Fit gravefellows you are for Douglass, Brown,
Turner and Truth and Tubman . . . whose rapt eyes
Fashioned a new world in this wilderness.

I’ll do it. Charles and Miss can look
Another place for hand or cook.
Some men rejoice in skill of hand,
And some in cultivating land,
But there are others who maintain
The right to cultivate the brain.”
“It seems to me,” said Booker T.,
“That all you folks have missed the boat
Who shout about the right to vote,
And spend vain days and sleepless nights
In uproar over civil rights.
Just keep your mouths shut, do not grouse,
But work, and save, and buy a house.”
“I don’t agree,” said W. E. B.,
“For what can property avail
If dignity and justice fail?
Unless you help to make the laws,
They’ll steal your house with trumped-up clause.
A rope’s as tight, a fire as hot,
No matter how much cash you’ve got.
Speak soft, and try your little plan,
But as for me, I’ll be a man.”

An Indignation Dinner,"Dey was hard times jes fo’ Christmas round our neighborhood one year;
So we held a secret meetin’, whah de white folks couldn’t hear,
To ’scuss de situation, an’ to see what could be done
Towa’d a fust-class Christmas dinneh an’ a little Christmas fun.
Rufus Green, who called de meetin’, ris an’ said: “In dis here town,
An’ throughout de land, de white folks is a-tryin’ to keep us down.”
S’ ’e: “Dey bought us, sold us, beat us; now dey ’buse us ’ca’se we’s free;
But when dey tetch my stomach, dey’s done gone too fur foh me!
“Is I right?”   “You sho is, Rufus!” roared a dozen hungry throats.
“Ef you’d keep a mule a-wo’kin’, don’t you tamper wid his oats.
“Dat’s sense,” continued Rufus. “But dese white folks nowadays
Has done got so close and stingy you can’t live on what dey pays.
“Here ’tis Christmas-time, an’, folkses, I’s indignant ’nough to choke.
Whah’s our Christmas dinneh comin’ when we’s ’mos’ completely broke?
I can’t hahdly ’fo’d a toothpick an’ a glass o’ water. Mad?
Say, I’m desp’ret! Dey jes better treat me nice, dese white folks had!”
Well, dey ’bused de white folks scan’lous, till old Pappy Simmons ris,
Leanin’ on his cane to s’pote him, on account his rheumatis’,
An’ s’ ’e: “Chilun, whut’s dat wintry wind a-sighin’ th’ough de street
’Bout yo’ wasted summeh wages?   But, no matter, we mus’ eat.
“Now, I seed a beau’ful tuhkey on a certain gemmun’s fahm.
He’s a-growin’ fat an’ sassy, an’ a-struttin’ to a chahm.
Chickens, sheeps, hogs, sweet pertaters—all de craps is fine dis year;
All we needs is a committee foh to tote de goodies here.”
Well, we lit right in an’ voted dat it was a gran’ idee,
An’ de dinneh we had Christmas was worth trabblin’ miles to see;
An’ we eat a full an’ plenty, big an’ little, great an’ small,
Not beca’se we was dishonest, but indignant, sah. Dat’s all.","Rufus Green: “Dey bought us, sold us, beat us; now dey ’buse us ’ca’se we’s free; but when dey tetch my stomach, dey's done gone too fur foh me!”"
To Any Reader,"As from the house your mother sees
You playing round the garden trees,
So you may see, if you will look
Through the windows of this book,
Another child, far, far away,
And in another garden, play.
But do not think you can at all,
By knocking on the window, call
That child to hear you. He intent
Is all on his play-business bent.
He does not hear; he will not look,
Nor yet be lured out of this book.
For, long ago, the truth to say,
He has grown up and gone away,
And it is but a child of air
That lingers in the garden there.","From the house your mother sees you playing round the garden trees,                So you may see, if you will look through the windows of this book, another child, far, far away, play. But do not think you can at all,                By knocking on the window, call that child to hear you. He intent is all on his play-business bent."
Ahead and Around,"Ahead and Around
Met, quarreled, quilled the bird of peace,
Untidied a pleasant plane.
Ahead accused Around of complete deceit,
Around accused Ahead of being discontented.
Neither listened to each.
Either lined on,
Making round straight and straight round,
Permitting nothing in-between,
Licked space clean,
Fattened unhappily and flew
Along the geometrical faith of two-and-two,
Hated apart; and far and far
Each wanderer
Hoped toward a spiritually reconnoitered heaven.
“For,” cried sinuous Around,
“More and less than I, am I,
Nature of all things, all things the nature of me.”
Ahead echoed the cry.
Sped toward its own eternity
Of the sweet end before the bitter beyond, beyond.
And both were brave and both were strong,
And the ways of both were like and long,
And adventured freely in fettered song:
One that circled as it sang,
One that longitudinally rang.
The spite prospered. The spite stopped.
Both earned the same end differently,
Prided along two different paths,
Reached the same humility
Of an old-trodden start.
Birth is the beginning where all part.
Death is the beginning where they meet.","Ahead accused Around of complete deceit. Around accused Ahead of being discontented. Neither listened to each. Either lined on, either made round straight and straight round. The spite stopped."
In The Matter Of Two Men,"One does such work as one will not,
    And well each knows the right;
Though the white storm howls, or the sun is hot,
    The black must serve the white.
And it’s, oh, for the white man’s softening flesh,
    While the black man’s muscles grow!
Well I know which grows the mightier,
    I know; full well I know.
The white man seeks the soft, fat place,
    And he moves and he works by rule.
Ingenious grows the humbler race
    In Oppression’s prodding school.
And it’s, oh, for a white man gone to seed,
    While the Negro struggles so!
And I know which race develops most,
    I know; yes, well I know.
The white man rides in a palace car,
    And the Negro rides “Jim Crow”
To damn the other with bolt and bar,
    One creepeth so low; so low!
And it’s, oh, for a master’s nose in the mire,
    While the humbled hearts o’erflow!
Well I know whose soul grows big at this,
    And whose grows small; I know!
The white man leases out his land,
    And the Negro tills the same.
One works; one loafs and takes command;
    But I know who wins the game!
And it’s, oh, for the white man’s shrinking soil.
    As the black’s rich acres grow!
Well I know how the signs point out at last,
    I know; ah, well I know!
The white man votes for his color’s sake.
    While the black, for his is barred;
(Though “ignorance” is the charge they make),
    But the black man studies hard.
And it’s, oh, for the white man’s sad neglect,
    For the power of his light let go!
So, I know which man must win at last,
    I know! Ah, Friend, I know!","""I know which grows the mightier. One does such work as one will not not do,"" he writes. ""I know whose soul grows big at this, and whose grows small,"" he adds."
The Road To The Bow,"Ever and ever anon,
    After the black storm, the eternal, beauteous bow!
Brother, to rosy-painted mists that arch beyond,
    Blithely I go.
My brows men laureled and my lyre
    Twined with immortal ivy for one little rippling song;
My “House of Golden Leaves” they praised and “passionate fire”—
    But, Friend, the way is long!
Onward and onward, up! away!
    Though Fear flaunt all his banners in my face,
And my feet stumble, lo! the Orphean Day!
    Forward by God’s grace!
These signs are still before me: “Fear,”
    “Danger,” “Unprecedented,” and I hear black “No”
Still thundering, and “Churl.” Good Friend, I rest me here—
    Then to the glittering bow!
Loometh and cometh Hate in wrath,
    Mailed Wrong, swart Servitude and Shame with bitter rue,
Nathless a Negro poet’s feet must tread the path
    The winged god knew.
Thus, my true Brother, dream-led, I
    Forfend the anathema, following the span.
I hold my head as proudly high
    As any man.","The poem is titled “After the black storm, the eternal, beauteous bow!” It is written in the form of a poem by the African-American poet Langston Hughes."
Laughter in the Slums,"In crippled streets where happiness seems buried
under the sooty snow of northern winter,
sudden as bells at twilight,
bright as the moon, full as the sun, there blossoms
in southern throats rich flower of flush fields
hot with the furnace sun of Georgia Junes,
laughter that cold and blizzards could not kill.","In crippled streets where happiness seems buried under the sooty snow of northern winter,                sudden as bells at twilight,                bright as the moon, full as the sun, there blossoms.                in southern throats rich flower of flush fields,                hot with the furnace sun of Georgia Junes"
Ballad of Birmingham,"         (On the bombing of a church in Birmingham, Alabama, 1963)
“Mother dear, may I go downtown
Instead of out to play,
And march the streets of Birmingham
In a Freedom March today?”
“No, baby, no, you may not go,
For the dogs are fierce and wild,
And clubs and hoses, guns and jails
Aren’t good for a little child.”
“But, mother, I won’t be alone.
Other children will go with me,
And march the streets of Birmingham
To make our country free.”
“No, baby, no, you may not go,
For I fear those guns will fire.
But you may go to church instead
And sing in the children’s choir.”
She has combed and brushed her night-dark hair,
And bathed rose petal sweet,
And drawn white gloves on her small brown hands,
And white shoes on her feet.
The mother smiled to know her child
Was in the sacred place,
But that smile was the last smile
To come upon her face.
For when she heard the explosion,
Her eyes grew wet and wild.
She raced through the streets of Birmingham
Calling for her child.
She clawed through bits of glass and brick,
Then lifted out a shoe.
“O, here’s the shoe my baby wore,
But, baby, where are you?”","On the bombing of a church in Birmingham, Alabama, 1963, a little girl asks her mother if she can go to a Freedom March. The mother says no, for the dogs are fierce and wild, and the guns will fire. The child then asks to go to church instead and sing in the children's choir."
The Negro Singer,"O’er all my song the image of a face
    Lieth, like shadow on the wild sweet flowers.
    The dream, the ecstasy that prompts my powers;
    The golden lyre’s delights bring little grace
To bless the singer of a lowly race.
    Long hath this mocked me: aye in marvelous hours,
    When Hera’s gardens gleamed, or Cynthia’s bowers,
    Or Hope’s red pylons, in their far, hushed place!
But I shall dig me deeper to the gold;
    Fetch water, dripping, over desert miles.
    From clear Nyanzas and mysterious Niles
Of love; and sing, nor one kind act withhold.
    So shall men know me, and remember long,
    Nor my dark face dishonor any song.","The Song of Solomon was written in the 4th century BC. It was written by Aaron Burr, the son of Aaron Burr and Aaron Burr's father, and was published in 18th century."
Paul Laurence Dunbar,"He came, a youth, singing in the dawn
    Of a new freedom, glowing o’er his lyre.
    Refining, as with great Apollo’s fire,
    His people’s gift of song.   And thereupon,
This Negro singer, come to Helicon,
    Constrained the masters, listening to admire,
    And roused a race to wonder and aspire,
    Gazing which way their honest voice was gone,
With ebon face uplit of glory’s crest.
    Men marveled at the singer, strong and sweet,
    Who brought the cabin’s mirth, the tuneful night,
But faced the morning, beautiful with light,
    To die while shadows yet fell toward the west,
    And leave his laurels at his people’s feet.
Dunbar, no poet wears your laurels now;
    None rises, singing, from your race like you.
    Dark melodist, immortal, though the dew
    Fell early on the bays upon your brow,
And tinged with pathos every halcyon vow
    And brave endeavor.   Silence o’er you threw
    Flowerets of love.   Or, if an envious few
    Of your own people brought no garlands, how
Could malice smite him whom the gods had crowned?
    If, like the meadow-lark, your flight was low,
    Your flooded lyrics half the hilltops drowned;
A wide world heard you, and it loved you so,
    It stilled its heart to list the strains you sang.
    And o’er your happy songs its plaudits rang.","A Negro singer, come to Helicon, Constrained the masters, listening to admire, and roused a race to wonder and aspire. He came, a youth, singing in the dawn of a new freedom, glowing o’er his lyre. With ebon face uplit of glory’s crest."
Compensation,"O, rich young lord, thou ridest by
With looks of high disdain;
It chafes me not thy title high,
Thy blood of oldest strain.
The lady riding at thy side
Is but in name thy promised bride.
       Ride on, young lord, ride on!
Her father wills and she obeys,
The custom of her class;

For Land he sells his lass.

And love for bird and beast and bee
And song of lark and hymn of sea,
       Ride on, young lord, ride on!
The boundless sky to me belongs,
The paltry acres thine;
The painted beauty sings thy songs,
The lavrock lilts me mine;
The hot-housed orchid blooms for thee,
The gorse and heather bloom for me,

The Wanderer,"I wander among the hills of alien lands
   Where Nature her prerogative resigns
To Man; where Comfort in her shack reclines
   And all the arts and sciences commands.
      But in my soul
      The eastern billows roll—
I hear the voices of my native strands.
My lingering eyes, a lonely hemlock fills
   With grace and splendor rising manifold;
Beneath her boughs the maples spread their gold
   And at her feet, the silver of rills.
      But in my heart
      A peasant void of art
Echoes the voices of my native hills.
On every height a studied art confines
   All human joy in social pulchritude;
The boxwood frowns where beckoning birches stood,
   And where the thrushes caroled Fashion dines.
      But through the spreading cheer
      The shepherd's reed I hear
Beneath my Lebanon terebinths and pines.
And though no voices here are heard of toil,
   Nor accents least of sorrow, nor the din
Of multitudes, nor even at the Inn
   The City is permitted aught to spoil,
      Yet in my breast,
       A shack at best,
Laments the mother of my native soil.
Even where the sumptuous solitudes deny
   A shelter to a bird or butterfly,
As in the humblest dwelling of the dale
   A gracious welcome's shown the passer-by;
       But evermore clear
       Allwhere I hear
The calling of my native hut and sky.
Land of my birth! a handful of thy sod
   Resuscitates the flower of my faith;
For whatsoever the seer of science sayth,
   Thou art the cradle and the tomb of God;
      And forever I behold
      A vision old
Of Beauty weeping where He once hath trod.",I wander among the hills of alien lands where Nature her prerogative resigns to Man; where Comfort in her shack reclines. And all the arts and sciences commands. But in my heart I am a peasant void of art.
After Reading King Lear,"Is ’t strange that in the cycle of his woes,
   Which shakes his cloud-embosomed peak of years
   And shatters the very fountain of his tears,
He seeks the friendly path of winds and snows?
When Villainy forgiven more villainous grows,
   And Treason in his robes herself attires,
   And Love beneath Adultery’s sheet expires,
Is ’t strange that mating with the Storm he goes?
Father and King! in sooth, they know thee well—
   The Whirlwind and the Forest and the Night;
But we who in the obscure shelters dwell
   Know better of thy sorrow than thy might.
Father and King! thy heritage is vast;
Wherever children be, its seeds are cast.","Father and King! in sooth, they know thee well. The Whirlwind and the Forest and the Night; But we who in the obscure shelters dwell know better of thy sorrow."
The House of Night,"Her sable robes the gloaming trails
   From golden strand to purple height,
And softly, over the welds and dales,
   Into the vacant House of Night.
But lo, where first her footsteps mark
   The sunset's last extinguished pyre,—
Above the hills,—a saffron spark,
   A gleam of unconjectured fire.
Between the foliaged zone and sky,
   Where sentries of the forest stand,
It peeps and flits—a firefly;
   It soars and glows—a firebrand.
A sacred flame from hemlock shades,
   Rising like a mystic sign
Above the silence of the glades
   Into the solitudes divine.
A sign perchance from those who pass
   To those who follow in the gloom,
Dancing round a moulten mass
   Above the grudging gulfs of doom.
A new-born world, though years untold
   Have fed the forge that gave it breath,
Where life still casts of beaten gold
   Cressets for the shrine of Death.
A dying world, though like a gem
   Of sapphire hues in nacre bright,
Drop from the zone or diadem
   Of the immortal queen of night.
A world! From depths to heights as dark
   It leaps anon into the dance
And whirls away—’t is but a spark
   From the anvil of the God of Chance,
But Faith and Fancy often mar
   The mystery of things divine;
For that which is a rolling star
   Was fluttering neath a lonely pine.
And lo, another orb doth roll
   Above the groves where once it trod;
And still another seeks its goal
   In the infinities of God.
From where the eagle marks his flight,
   Across the void that earth-bound seems,
They twinkle forth, a circle of light,
   Around the Gloaming's couch of dreams.
And thus they first themselves disguise
   As glow worms in the gathering gloom,
And suddenly refulgent rise
   O'er the abysmal tracks of doom.
For aeons thus, from hill to sea,
   Athwart the grudging gulfs they glow;
And waning tell of the worlds that be
   And the ghosts of worlds of long ago.
For aeons thus, their torches high,
   The gods unseen—as when the light
Of day conceals the starry sky—
   Illuminate the House of Night.","A new-born world, though years untold have fed the forge that gave it breath, where life still casts of beaten gold for the shrine of Death. Her sable robes the gloaming trails from golden strand to purple height."

When the Frost is on the Punkin,"When the frost is on the punkin and the fodder’s in the shock,

And the rooster’s hallylooyer as he tiptoes on the fence;

O Freedom,"O Freedom, in thy cause I fought, 
   For twenty years I fought in vain; 
And in my mountain shelter naught
   But worthless trophies now remain. 
Yet in my heart I hear a cry, 
   Which never there makes a vain appeal:
I would once more beneath thy sky
   Brandish my sharp and shining steel. 

How much one stakes upon thy dream, 
   How much for but thy name we pay; 
How cheap the passing ages seem, 
   When years are given for thy day. 
How many still would fight and die
   In thine old cause and for thy weal! 
I would once more beneath thy sky
   Brandish my sharp and shining steel. 

The purest love I give away, 
   The bliss of it I set at naught; 
Again I'm on my wayward way 
   Seeking what I have often sought. 
My wounded hopes, my bleeding ties, 
   No peace inglorious e’er shall heal: 
I would once more beneath thy skies 
   Brandish my sharp and shining steel. 

O Freedom, though thy price be high, 
   Though one for thee his life must seal, 
I would once more beneath thy sky
  Brandish my sharp and shining steel. ","O Freedom, in thy cause I fought,    For twenty years I fought in vain;   But worthless trophies now remain. O Freedom, though thy price be high,                    Though one for thee his life must seal."
Wet-weather Talk,"It hain’t no use to grumble and complane;
It’s jest as cheap and easy to rejoice.—
When God sorts out the weather and sends rain,
W’y rain’s my choice.
Men ginerly, to all intents—
Although they’re apt to grumble some—
Puts most theyr trust in Providence,
And takes things as they come—
That is, the commonality
Of men that’s lived as long as me
Has watched the world enugh to learn
They’re not the boss of this concern.
With some, of course, it’s different—
I’ve saw young men that knowed it all,
And didn’t like the way things went
On this terrestchul ball;—
But all the same, the rain, some way,
Rained jest as hard on picnic day;
Er, when they railly wanted it,
It mayby wouldn’t rain a bit!
In this existunce, dry and wet
Will overtake the best of men—
Some little skift o’ clouds’ll shet
The sun off now and then.—
And mayby, whilse you’re wundern who
You’ve fool-like lent your umbrell’ to,
And want it—out’ll pop the sun,
And you’ll be glad you hain’t got none!
It aggervates the farmers, too—
They’s too much wet, er too much sun,
Er work, er waitin’ round to do
Before the plowin’ ’s done:
And mayby, like as not, the wheat,
Jest as it’s lookin’ hard to beat,
Will ketch the storm—and jest about
The time the corn’s a-jintin’ out.
These-here cy-clones a-foolin’ round—
And back’ard crops!—and wind and rain!—
And yit the corn that’s wallerd down
May elbow up again!—
They hain’t no sense, as I can see,
Fer mortuls, sech as us, to be
A-faultin’ Natchur’s wise intents,
And lockin’ horns with Providence!
It hain’t no use to grumble and complane;
It’s jest as cheap and easy to rejoice.—

The Old Swimmin' Hole,"Oh! the old swimmin’-hole! whare the crick so still and deep
Looked like a baby-river that was laying half asleep,
And the gurgle of the worter round the drift jest below
Sounded like the laugh of something we onc’t ust to know
Before we could remember anything but the eyes
Of the angels lookin’ out as we left Paradise;
But the merry days of youth is beyond our controle,
And it’s hard to part ferever with the old swimmin’-hole.
Oh! the old swimmin’-hole! In the happy days of yore,
When I ust to lean above it on the old sickamore,
Oh! it showed me a face in its warm sunny tide
That gazed back at me so gay and glorified,
It made me love myself, as I leaped to caress
My shadder smilin’ up at me with sich tenderness.
But them days is past and gone, and old Time’s tuck his toll
From the old man come back to the old swimmin’-hole.
Oh! the old swimmin’-hole! In the long, lazy days
When the humdrum of school made so many run-a-ways,
How plesant was the jurney down the old dusty lane,
Whare the tracks of our bare feet was all printed so plane
You could tell by the dent of the heel and the sole
They was lots o’ fun on hands at the old swimmin’-hole.
But the lost joys is past! Let your tears in sorrow roll
Like the rain that ust to dapple up the old swimmin’ hole.
Thare the bullrushes growed, and the cattails so tall,
And the sunshine and shadder fell over it all;
And it mottled the worter with amber and gold
Tel the glad lilies rocked in the ripples that rolled;
And the snake-feeder’s four gauzy wings fluttered by
Like the ghost of a daisy dropped out of the sky,
Or a wownded apple-blossom in the breeze’s controle
As it cut acrost some orchard to’rds the old swimmin’-hole.
Oh! the old swimmin’-hole! When I last saw the place,
The scenes was all changed, like the change in my face;
The bridge of the railroad now crosses the spot
Whare the old divin’-log lays sunk and fergot.
And I stray down the banks whare the trees ust to be—
But never again will theyr shade shelter me!
And I wish in my sorrow I could strip to the soul,
And dive off in my grave like the old swimmin’-hole.","The author recalls the old swimmin’-hole where he used to play with his friends as a boy. He recalls the days when the sun shone and the water was warm and clear, and he could see a face in its warm sunny tide. But now the place is gone, and the river has changed."

A Barefoot Boy,"A barefoot boy! I mark him at his play—
For May is here once more, and so is he,—
His dusty trousers, rolled half to the knee,
And his bare ankles grimy, too, as they:
Cross-hatchings of the nettle, in array
Of feverish stripes, hint vividly to me
Of woody pathways winding endlessly
Along the creek, where even yesterday
He plunged his shrinking body—gasped and shook—
Yet called the water “warm,” with never lack
Of joy. And so, half enviously I look
Upon this graceless barefoot and his track,—
His toe stubbed—ay, his big toe-nail knocked back
Like unto the clasp of an old pocketbook.","A barefoot boy! I mark him at his play. For May is here once more, and so is he. His dusty trousers, rolled half to the knee,                And his bare ankles grimy, too, as they:"
I Have Folded My Sorrows,"I have folded my sorrows into the mantle of summer night,
Assigning each brief storm its allotted space in time,
Quietly pursuing catastrophic histories buried in my eyes.
And yes, the world is not some unplayed Cosmic Game,
And the sun is still ninety-three million miles from me,
And in the imaginary forest, the shingled hippo becomes the gray unicorn.
No, my traffic is not with addled keepers of yesterday’s disasters,
Seekers of manifest disembowelment on shafts of yesterday’s pains.
Blues come dressed like introspective echoes of a journey.
And yes, I have searched the rooms of the moon on cold summer nights.
And yes, I have refought those unfinished encounters.
      Still, they remain unfinished.
And yes, I have at times wished myself something different.
The tragedies are sung nightly at the funerals of the poet;
The revisited soul is wrapped in the aura of familiarity. ","The author has 'folded his sorrows into the mantle of summer night' and 'pursued catastrophic histories buried in his eyes' The tragedies are sung nightly at the funerals of the poet, he writes."
Hanem,"Hanem, we must have met before, 
   Perhaps a thousand years ago; 
I still remember when I tore 
   Your virgin veil of lunar snow. 
By Allah, I remember, too, 
   When, sousing in my mortal bain, 
You bit my lip and said, “Adieu,
   When shall we, Syrian, meet again?”
Hanem, thine eyes are brighter far
    Than when in mine they shone one day; 
I wager every moon and star
    The tax of lustre to them pay. 
And those who dared with them to jest, 
   Where are they now?—those lovers slain
Who whispered dying on your breast, 
   “O Hanem, shall we meet again?”
The victims of your eyes are here, 
   In pyramids they keep their clay; 
And even your sister Flames are near, 
   They fain would kiss my soul away. 
Full many a time from them you bore
   This mortal love, this mortal gain; 
Remember Nubia’s sable shore—
   When shall we, Hanem, meet again? 
Why quickly through the Cairo street?—
   Will you return?—Shall I remain? 
Fate might not ever the chance repeat; 
   When shall we, Hanem, meet again? ","""O Hanem, shall we meet again?” is a poem written by Syrian poet Hanem. Hanem writes: “I still remember when I tore                    Your virgin veil of lunar snow”"

Constantinople,"When Othman’s sword, as Paleologue’s, is broken
And Othman’s gods are smitten to the dust,
And naught remains, not even a rusty token
Of their hierarchal cruelty and lust;—
When church and mosque and synagogue shall be,
Despite the bigot’s cry, the zealot’s prayer,
Unbounded in their bounties all and free
In every heritage divine to share;—
When thou shalt rise, rejoicing in thy loss,
Upon the ruins of a state nefast
To reconcile the Crescent and the Cross
And wash thy hands of thine unholy past;—
When with the faith new-born of East and West,
Which spans the azure heights of man’s desire,
The spirit of thy people, long oppressed,
Is all a-glow with its undying fire;—
When thou thyself, Byzantium, shalt stand
In the minaret of Freedom and thy voice,
Rising above the muazzens in the land,
Bids all the seekers of the light rejoice;—
When in thy heart the flame of freedom sings,
And in thy hand the torch of freedom glows,
And in thy word the sword of freedom rings,
And in thy deed the seed of freedom grows,—
Then shall we call thee Mistress of the Morn,
Bride of the Straits, Queen of the Golden Horn.","When Othman’s sword, as Paleologue's, is broken, and the gods are smitten to the dust, and naught remains, not even a rusty token of their hierarchal cruelty and lust, when church and mosque and synagogue shall be, then shall we call thee Mistress of the Morn,Bride of the Straits, Queen of the Golden Horn.

The Fruits of Death,"Said the folded Leaves upon the Heath

“Soon will the Warders of the Storm
   Bring us to our Mother-Sea,
Even as they opened yesternight
   Our prison doors of Destiny:
We envy not the Birds now nor the Dew;
To them we leave the Forest and to you.”
The infant Leaves thus made reply:
   “But we rejoice that we are here;
We stand in the cerulean Gate
   Of Life to crown the dying Year.
Him who emancipates we love,
   He who enchains is also dear:
You are the Flowers of the Storm, and we,
We are the Fruits of Death upon Life’s tree.","Said the folded Leaves upon the Heath: “Soon will the Warders of the Storm Bring us to our Mother-Sea,” and “To them we leave the Forest and to you’"
The Song of Siva,"’Tis Night; all the Sirens are silent,
   All the Vultures asleep;
And the horns of the Tempest are stirring
   Under the Deep;
’Tis Night; all the snow-burdened
   Mountains Dream of the Sea,
And down in the Wadi the River
   Is calling to me.
’Tis Night; all the Caves of the Spirit
   Shake with desire,
And the Orient Heaven’s essaying
   Its lances of fire;
They hear, in the stillness that covers
   The land and the sea,
The River, in the heart of the Wadi,
   Calling to me.
’Tis night, but a night of great joyance,
   A night of unrest;—
The night of the birth of the spirit

Reflections,"I walked along the countryside
At eventide,
And everywhere
The road was fair
With moons of water here and there,
Into whose heart the grasses spied.
And suddenly upon them shone
The light of the City’s eye,
Reflected from a bulb on high.
Which made them and their shadow one,
Nay, made each moon
A mirror seem
To serve the dream
Of tender blades in bending grace a-swoon.
I walked into the night,
And every abode
Beyond the dark, deserted road
Was a prattle of light.
And I thought of the Eye Unseen
Which sheds its charitable sheen,
Not on our goal,
But on the by-ways of the Soul.","The author walked along the countryside looking for the City's eye. He thought of the Eye Unseen, which sheds its charitable sheen. The book is published by Hodder & Stoughton, priced £20."
The Cataclysm,"Even through the City of the Dead she passed,
Her sack of Horror’s harvest to refill;
And lo, into the untilled world she cast,
With a million hands, the black seeds of her will.
But in the bone-strewn waste I saw a snail
Crawling out of the socket of a skull,
Exultant still;—
Rising from the universal bane
To thank the rain.
And in the thorny flanks of the riven tomb,
Gorged yesteryear with the fruits of fear and doubt
The nations bear when their sinews run out,
I saw the crocus weave her tender bloom
Into the ivy’s tangled hair,
While struggling out of the gloom
To praise the air.
The Cataclysm, passing to her goal.
Turned inside out the pockets of the world,
Not sparing even the altar of the soul,
Which at the cradle of the soul she hurled.
But when at last she fell
Across the sill of hell,
I saw her incalculable toll,
A butterfly
Winging out of the riddled emblem of God
Toward the sky;—
Rising with the faith re-won
To serenade the sun.","""I saw the crocus weave her tender bloom into the sky,"" says the poet. ""I saw a snail crawl out of the socket of a skull,"" he adds. ""And in the thorny flanks of the riven tomb, I saw her fall"""
The End and the Beginning,"The deed is done, O Kings: the blood is shed:
   The sword is broken:—broken, too, the Cross.
But she, the mother eternal of the dead,
   Though sorrow-laden, smiles at the loss.
You go down grimed with the blood and smoke of wars;
   Your armies scattered and your banners furled;
She comes down covered with the dust of stars,
   And gives her life again to build the world.","The sword is broken, too, the Cross. But she, the mother eternal of the dead, smiles at the loss. The deed is done, O Kings: the blood is shed."
The Towers and the Night,"Over the White Way’s flood of light,
Over its sea of fiery flowers,
Arose the voice of the ancient Night
And the youthful Towers:
“O Night of nations passed,” the Towers said,
“One day stood high your monuments, but now
Your highest pyramid must lift its head
To see the lights that crown our City’s brow.”
“But man,” replied the Night, “shall crown the stars
With flowers of thought divine,
And write his name upon a monument
Greater than yours and mine.”","Over the White Way’s flood of light, over its sea of fiery flowers, rose the voice of the ancient Night. “O Night of nations passed,” the Towers said, “One day stood high your monuments, but now your highest pyramid must lift its head”"
Dorothy Dances,"This is no child that dances. This is flame.
Here fire at last has found its natural frame.
What else is that which burns and flies
From those enkindled eyes...
What is that inner blaze
Which plays
About that lighted face?...
This thing is fire set free—
Fire possesses her, or rather she
Controls its mastery.
With every gesture, every rhythmic stride,
Beat after beat,
It follows, purring at her side,
Or licks the shadows of her flashing feet.
Around her everywhere
It coils its thread of yellow hair.
Through every vein its bright blood creeps,
And its red hands
Caress her as she stands
Or lift her boldly when she leaps.
Then, as the surge
Of radiance grows stronger
These two are two no longer
And they merge
Into a disembodied ecstasy;
Free
To express some half-forgotten hunger,
Some half-forbidden urge.
What mystery
Has been at work until it blent
One child and that fierce element?
Give it no name.
It is enough that flesh has danced with flame.","Fire possesses her, or rather she                Controls its mastery. With every gesture, every rhythmic stride, Beat after beat, it follows, purring at her side, or licks her feet."

Waikīkī Returns,"            I do not have any memories of Waikīkī ever being like this
not even in my father’s stories was she so utterly alone.
            No sunburnt tourists, no convertibles on Kalākaua Ave.
not even a leathery beach boy to survey the shoreline.
            Waikiki remembers though
her long curved neck of white sand anchoring
            empty hotels offers herself up to lapping little waves
rushing forward then pulling back again and again.
            Silver flashes of halalū close to the shoreline
hundreds pulsing instinctively forming an arrow
            then bursting into a corona, doubling back with black
eyes and thin fins twisting like the lie
            of a skilled lover, dazzling. The old rock wall under
the newly paved walkway jutting out past the reef
            so clear I can see the outlines of my brother and I
timing the crash of waves, holding hands as we jump
            from the ledge over the white spray
the sucking boom as our bodies
            break the surface while unseen watery hands
push us back up. Perhaps those same hands tickling
            the belly of that honu, its green-gray shell ascending.
Covid has managed the unimaginable, has returned
            Waikīkī to herself. Is it wrong to be so grateful?
I share this early morning quiet with a lone fisherman casting
            near the transplanted kukui nut trees which have no business
being there. The thin nylon line invisible against
            the slowly brightening sky and I never want anyone to return.
The drumming shoreline, gleam of the gold crucifix against
            the fisherman’s chest, salty air on my cheek—
all of it strengthening our way back into the light.","Covid has managed the unimaginable, has returned Waikiki to herself. Is it wrong to be so grateful? She shares this early morning quiet with a lone fisherman."
She Went Out Singing,"She went out singing, and the poppies still
  Crowd round her door awaiting her return; 
She went out dancing, and the doleful rill
   Lingers beneath her walls her news to learn. 

Their love is but a seed of what she has sown;
Their grief is but a shadow of my own. 

O Tomb, O Tomb! did Zahra’s beauty fade, 
  Or dost thou still preserve it in thy gloom?

From the Arabic,"Why art thou so hushed and sad, 
  So thin and wan? 
Who robbed thee of thy flesh and song,—
  Was it Ramadhan? 
Nay, Ramadhan is not to blame, 
   For I have ceased to fast and pray; 
But to my vacant Dwelling came 
   An unknown Guest—he came to stay. 
And in my heart he eats and drinks; 
   He drinks my blood, of wines the best, 
And eats my burning flesh,—ah, yes, 
   My love for Zahra is that Guest. ",Who robbed thee of thy flesh and song? Was it Ramadhan? For I have ceased to fast and pray. But to my vacant Dwelling came an unknown Guest. And in my heart he eats and drinks.
The Lost Disciple,"O Master, I can not adventure with thee; 
  At the Door of the Dawn, in my lone wandering, 
I have broken my staff; for the true dawn is she 
  Who comes every day with her jar to the spring. 
Ay, Master, I tarried last night at the gate
   Of her garden, which kisses the Lake Galilee; 
She was gathering flowers and fruits for the Fete, 
   And with tulips and poppies she beckoned to me. 
In her lamp there was oil, in my hand there was fire; 
   In her house cried a voice, ‘O make haste with the flame!’
On my lips were the names of the daughters of Tyre, 
   On her breast were the lilies that whispered thy name. 
I have dared, O my Master, to envy thy feet, 
   And to yearn for the love of a Magdalen fair; 
I have dreamed that mine, too, in the heart of the street, 
   Were laved with her own hands and dried with her hair. 
O Master, my lips her devotion have stained, 
  For her soul’s precious ointments were offered late; 
I have lost in the fire of my lust what I gained 
   In my longing and love for her love and thy fate. ","I have broken my staff; for the true dawn is she, who comes every day with her jar to the spring. O Master, I can not adventure with thee;  I have lost in the fire of my lust what I gained."
The Pagan,"I walked into her Temple, as of yore
  My Tyrian sires, allured by cryptic signs; 
But sudden as I entered closed the door 
  Upon the hope that mortal love resigns
   Before her ancient, myrtle-bowered shrines. 
I sorrowed not; though every lamp I lit 
  Flamed up in speech articulate and said, 
Beware, O foolish Worshipper! ’t is writ:
   “Who craves a gift shall give his soul instead, 
    Who lights a lamp is curséd of the dead.”
I did not heed; I passed from shrine to shrine, 
   Filling the lamps with oil, the Fane with light; 
But when I approached, O One Eternal, thine, 
   I heard the terror of her tongue, and Night 
   Was creeping on her brow of malachite. 
I did not stop, although the votive oil
   I poured into thine urn to water turned; 
But when the Dawn her enchantments came to foil, 
    The secret of thy clemency I learned—
    Again the oil thine altar burned. 
The suddenly the Temple shook and swayed, 
   And all the shrines, except thine, disappeared; 
Even so her heart, by knowledge undismayed, 
   On Love’s one altar with thy hand upreared, 
   To Love’s one God is evermore endeared. ","I walked into her Temple, as of yore my Tyrian sires, allured by cryptic signs. But sudden as I entered closed the door. Upon the hope that mortal love resigns."
Beans,"They’re not like peaches or squash.
Plumpness isn’t for them. They like
being lean, as if for the narrow
path. The beans themselves sit qui-
etly inside their green pods. In-
stinctively one picks with care, 
never tearing down the fine vine,
never noticing their crisp bod-
ies, or feeling their willingness for
the pot, for the fire.
I have thought sometimes that
something—I can’t name it—
watches as I walk the rows, accept-
ing the gift of their lives to assist
mine.
I know what you think: this is fool-
ishness. They’re only vegetables.
Even the blossoms with which they
begin are small and pale, hardly sig-
nificant Our hands, or minds, our
feet hold more intelligence. With
this I have no quarrel. 
But, what about virtue?","I know what you think: this is fool-                ishness. They’re only vegetables. Our hands, or minds, ourfeet hold more intelligence. With this I have no quarrel. But, what about virtue?"
Our Red Road,"This morning I didn’t even honi you when I came in.
I just walked right by your shallow breath,
your eyes shut in the living room, and that bed
stuffed with pulu. And all the blurred words
projecting onto the backs of your eyelids.
Ke alanui maʻawe ‘ula a Kanaloa…
I organize your prescription bottles like kiʻi
along the edges of the kitchen heiau
and try to remember how long it’s been
since you strung a sentence together
and draped it over my shoulders.
I grew up mountain view and I can always see
mauna kea and mauna loa same time
In the afternoon I thicken your drinking water,
obsessing on what you’ll want for the road, and pack
some paʻi ʻai a me ka iʻa. Bundled guesswork
disguised as intention once the oceans open up.
I keep a version of you in my pocket that asks,
Maybe this red road is not mine, but ours, Boy?
So make some food for you, too.
In the evening I sit you up and our eyes trace the octopus’s
footprints moonlit in the yard grass. You smile
and gulp the thick water, and I keep obsessing
about which muʻumuʻu you’ll want to wear in the waʻa.","This morning I didn’t even honi you when I came in. This morning I just walked right by your shallow breath.

pronunciation,"For now, we speak only in brooms:
         sweeping sand across the teeth 
of concrete slabs, we brush and repeat 
         each stone syllable of the clearing
where our great grandparents are buried. 
Some words for memory are always here, 
         sounded out by the ant feet 
hefting sand grit and glitter homes, fan-light
         over the blue tongues of plastic flowers— 
the weeds will try to cover all the other ways 
         of saying history. 
But our pronunciation begins with the clearing we make in our bodies first:
where the broom handle widens the oh’s 
         in the mouth of our hands, 
how we shake open the throat 
         to settle each pile of leaves before burning them.
Trust the body to open in our language
         with the rhythm of weight—
one hand pushing sand, 
         the other pulling syllables
in one last sway 
         as we close the gate of the malaʻe 
so the trees can better hiss-hush at the edge of the ancestor 
         speaking in all our names.","The words for memory are always here,  sounded out by the ant feet. For now, we speak only in brooms, sweeping sand across the teeth."
"Lei Kukui, Lei Kuahu","The impermanence of lei
On dark altars of stone
A dream of lei kukui
Placed on the kuahu
Coils of lush green leaves
Fragrant leaf stems neatly knotted
Plaited along a backspine
Joined one to the other
Bound by a fast symmetry
Calling forth 
The spectral presences
Of our gods 
We seek your permission,
That you will hear 
Our importunate prayers
Our songs through the far forests
And as with birds
Contemn their dark silences with light;
We seek your companionship,
On our right shoulders and left
Above us and below
The surround of your playful
And somber accompaniments
Your presences in our gardens
Your residencies on our altars;
We seek wakefulness,
That we long slumbering
Yet evanescent
Will become luminous
As leaves on brightened paths;
We seek your acceptance,
That the hidden canopies
Will reveal themselves
Each bright leaf 
Giving itself of its own accord;
We seek resonance,
From the tops of our heads
To the bottoms of our feet
From the center of our chests
To the leaf tips of our hands
We seek all of these things—
A purer correspondence 
With the radiance of leaves.","We seek your permission, that you will hear our importunate prayers, our songs through the far forests. We seek your companionship, that the hidden canopies will reveal themselves, and we seek wakefulness, that we long slumbering will become luminous."

Do/Do Not,"I sniff the blooming tiger lily,

from one mouth.
I poison the river unintentionally.
I walk on the designated paths.
I splice the mountain, its body and mouth gaping.
I collect rainwater in a wheelbarrow.

they rupture its stomach.
I water the strawberries.
Again I fill my gas tank with dead things,
generations spun together until shiny.
I feed the ducks fresh lettuce.
I maneuver the dead squirrel
on the road, mark the moment
when creature becomes meat.
I accept that my love is a
poisonous flower, routinely fatal.
I calculate the force of
loving in each glittering death.

deep forest, the electric greens and

Bilingualism,"I saw my grandmother on a billboard
stretched out in a green dress like a snake
out on a walk alone in swamp maples.
Reclining, smoking a cigarette as though
an advertisement for bourbon in a casino,
watching me and never intending to speak.
Not a single wood chip of a word,
would not give up a single playing card of a leaf.
All I could think was, Who was she
to sell anything to, her poles rusty
in that expanse of reeds and skunk cabbage,
with a weasel animal that slipped off into shallows...?

Moving Day,"That painting with the stack of framed poems,

shown just a bit in the left corner,
stairs that lead up to the bell tower
and a panorama of a great religious city
with gold bells like giant overturned cups,
where the pots hang around
like copper-bottomed clouds
and there’s a pitch-black melon on a plate
on a table with two legs under a cracked window,
I bring the whole first stanza in and hang it up
in this bare example of a room,
the spider too. Details of the impasto soup
waft up in dotted lines, reaching

The Gallery,"A stack of framed poems

each of the five poems

into an Italian atelier, under a Mansard roof
brass ladles and copper-bottomed pots,
a cleaned rabbit, scullery basket of potatoes,
a clan of obese clouds.

over the pots and pans, over the bloom
of detail, where they act as emphasized clouds

The Word,"A woman is walking a word that’s ½ a poodle
near this cursive gate where you’re standing & reading
“A woman is walking a word that’s ½ a poodle,”
that’s an –ism, that’s an act, state, process,
doctrine, theory or cult, past my name,
past the TOBACCO shop, the FRUIT shoppe
with bananas like hands on an American flag
& serrated watermelon; she passes the Happy Face
& many other pedestrians; past the little church
with the black and white tiled rhyme
then the carefully mown slogans that are golf courses:
Just Do It, Milk, It Does a Body Good,
the open air market where oranges and pears
are stacked as semi-colons &
past the sentence in block letters that endlessly cir-
culates as the air conditioning for buildings B thru D.
A woman is walking a word that’s ½ a poodle.
A felt green gentleman at a pencil-d in café table, chair, ob-
serves that the same woman passes with the same dog
every 5 seconds or it’s 3 blue and white W’s in a row
made of gel and foam, then 3 lower case b’s.
She’s out buying a bayonet of bread.
Above, in the yellow sky, a phrase drifts.
At the third word of this poem,
right in front of my house the stanza,
the dog writes a single letter “s,” an anus fruit,
a pasty cookie, on the sidewalk: PLEASE CURB YOUR DOGs
I am just a scribble. Between the woman and the dog
there’s a gap of 3 typed spaces in which she controls him
with the leash of spelling,
mis-. Madeleine knows there’s a snake of consciousness
hibernating under the ground, a cemetery for shapes,
blobs, blots, objects without names,
and so the gap widens & it’s here that the dog flees,
landscape in the distant corner of the gap
and a dragon.","A woman is walking a word that’s ½ a poodle. A dog writes a single letter “s,” an anus fruit, on the sidewalk: PLEASE CURB YOUR DOGs."
Bird Saver,"ONE TUBE OF BIRD SONG joins the next

follow each other around, link arms
shadowy vectors and ducts of half made-
out sounds right behind, follow each other
under the ceiling fan in the rented room

as a dirty cloud, above the radiator that says,
quote cloud unquote.
                         On a room that wavers, darkens, will reset,
pipes that come in three colors—promenade,
hacking, and white listening—a listening-to-opera-while-
cooking-dinner-near-an-open-window-in-early-spring—
and the do-si-do is on the brite green lawn,
a wallpaper of blossoms in the window pane.
                                                   Unlike the view
into a room that is periodically bricked over,
the villa with an urn of pitch-black flowers on a vine,
or the origami of other birds the Baltimore oriole
folded over the cardinal over the cedar waxwing

to move around under the pipes,

In the courtyard,"Some mauve words, some beaded trees:
this part of spring overwhelms me,
each planted tree a comparison
done in seed pearls, a version
onto which strips of lilac felt are pressed
then held in place for a few seconds
above a generalized base—
as though created by someone skilled with a glue gun
& the types of detail I’m no good at.
I can’t compete: what I’ve done
stands toward the back of the courtyard near the church wall,
a few fuzzy words from several years ago.
That one of the words has turned a shade of ochre
that's hard to come by—that I’ve been trying to put my hands
         on for years—
purely by chance (plus exposure to a few
back-to-back winters) is most discouraging.","This part of spring overwhelms me. Each planted tree a comparison done in seed pearls. Some mauve words, some beaded trees. I can’t compete: what I’ve done is nothing."

Sonnet branches,"The forearm of spring rests on the window sill      
to the kitchen where I’m boiling opera for pasta.
This branch of spring is a real interloper,
a man’s arm covered in hard yellow blossoms,
No. 2 yellow, like a line of forsythia
in inter-winter-spring. Other sonnet branches
are scattered in the backyard, fourteen limbs
decked out in the darling buds of May.
The man’s branch intrudes through the open
window in early spring, so it’s a line in a poem.

a tiny banner unfurling PRIVACY  *  NET NEUTRALITY 
* DEREGULATION. Sound of emoji blood

going postal, kamikaze, road rage, suicide bomber
“hurling down to the House of Death so many sturdy souls,”
sound of emoji blood.
A sword pierces Blushing Emoji #956, Pram’s son,
below the groin, and “the dark came whirling down
across his eyes”; a hurled spear is shot through the temple of
Angry Emoji #23, only son of Matthew Thornton

sound of emoji blood. Sound of Emoji blood as Weeping
Emoji #3,418, daughter of the river god, a bullet
plunging into her lung, lodges in the “mortal spot,”
scream fumes.
Outside the village firewall, internet access was slowing
way, way down until the CEO who has her eye on Jim,

The Flame Tree,"My neighbor has decided to poison the flame tree.
He is right, of course.
The tree is over 20 years old, huge, spreading,
and the termites have worn jagged roads clear to its top.
It’s clearly a danger
tilting toward our house—
some fickle wind
my neighbor says could blow it over. 
Every fañomnåkan, it sends out its bursts of orange blossoms;
it blooms and blooms and blooms relentlessly,
the flares it sends shooting out into space
more stunning than fireworks 
through the window
where my mother
riveted to a bed, doomed by her body to a colorless spot, 
gazes out, her head on a pillow—
might have seemed like forever to her who used to climb green mountain sides—
and watches that tree full of sparrows
chittering
chattering
flitting here and there
and the outlandish blazing petals
steadfastly singing against the blue sky.
My neighbor, true to his word,
injected a poisonous brew bought at Home Depot into the trunk of the tree,
the toxic river
traveling up up up following the termite trails to the heart 
of the fire.
He is right, of course.
The tree came back the following year,
its clusters unflinchingly parading their bursts of rebellious orange.
But the poison had done its work—
see, where there was a canopy of flames
there are now just a handful here and there,
one spray in particular desperately
reaching out 
like a fist full of beauty 
to the window
where she 
used to watch for its return.","The tree is over 20 years old, huge, spreading, and the termites have worn jagged roads clear to its top. My neighbor has decided to poison the flame tree. He is right, of course."

Prayer in the Desert,"O Lord of Bounties, melt thy heaven’s breath,
Which spreads its gold around the head of Death,—
Which, while it smiles, devours all living things,
Giving to Desolation wondrous wings:
Lest in the waste Arabia’s star should wane,
A little rain, Allah, a little rain.
Thou Bountiful, thy Sun is weaving fast
The shroud of Earth now in the sand-storm cast;
Earth can not weep,—the well of faith is run,—
Its rivers and its desert sands are one:
O thou Bestower, once more sustain
Thy sun-crowned Daughter with a little rain.
Quiet this rising phantom-haunted sea
Of sands; the Faithful from its fury free;
Enchain the monsters of the dire simoom,—
Let not the desert be thy children’s tomb.
Thou Merciful, assist us to attain
Our goal,––a little rain, a little rain!
Arabia’s thousand wounds to thee appeal,
And with our lips its gaping wounds we seal;
Prostrate upon the sands we lift our hearts,
Pierced in thy presence by thy flaming darts.
Thy children, Allah, in the throes of pain,
Pray for a little rain, a little rain!","A little rain, Allah, a little rain. O Lord of Bounties, melt thy heaven’s breath. O thou Bestower, once more sustain Thy sun-crowned Daughter."
Andalusia,"I
Alcazar
There was a rhapsody in all her moods,
     A child-like grace, a passion unrestrained;
     Her throne, which bard and saki shared, was stained
With virgin wine as with the blood of feuds;
And in her lyric-woven interludes,
     Epitomizing destiny and time,
     Her spirit, hid in opalescent rhyme,
The shades of Melancholy still eludes.
Where’er she trod, the rose and bulbul meet;
    Where’er she revelled, gardens ever blow;
Where’er she danced, the henna of her feet
    Yet lends a lustre to the poppy’s glow;—
Arabia, dark-eyed, light-hearted, fair,
Is but a flower in Andalusia’s hair.
  II
Alhambra
 
Gods of the silence, still remembering
    The dying echoes of her lute, bemoan,
    In canticles of golden monotone,
Her Orient splendor too soon vanishing;
And while lions guard her courts, grey eagles wing
    Around her turqoise domes, and seedlings blown
    From distant lands to her hushed fountains cling,
Yea, and the sun himself sits in her throne.
Time, once her vassal, lingers near the streams
    That woo the shadows of her crumbling walls,
And, musing of Alhambra’s glory, dreams
    Of Elegance and Power in Myrtle Halls;—
Arabia, once counted of the strong,
Is but a sigh in Andalusia’s song.
  III
The Mosque
In the bewildering grove of colonnades,
    Once brilliant with a flood of saffron light,
    Poured from ten thousand lanterns day and night,
Her memory, like spikenard in the glades
Of distant lnd or Yemen, never fades;
    And her devotion, though the ages blight
    The mystic bloom of her divine delight,
Still casts on alien altars longing shades.
But through the mihrabs which the humble hand
    Of genius wrought, o’er marbles hollowed deep
By knees that only Piety could command,
    I see Oblivion coming forth to reap;—
Arabia, in Allah’s chaplet strung,
Is but a word on Andalusia’s tongue.
  IV
Al-Zahra
Not with the Orient glamor of her pleasures,
    Nor with fond rhapsodies of prayer or song
    Could she her sovereign reign a day prolong;
Not in the things of beauty that man measures
By the variable humor of his leisures,
    Or by the credibilities that change
    From faith to fantasy to rumor strange,
Was she the mistress of immortal treasures.
But when the holy shrine Europa sought,
    Herself of sin and witchcraft to assoil,
The sovereigns of Al-Zahra maxims wrought
    And Averroes burned his midnight oil;—
Arabia, the bearer of the light,
Still sparkles in the diadem of Night.","Alcazar was a bard and saki with a child-like grace, a passion unrestrained. Her spirit hid in opalescent rhyme, and the shades of Melancholy still eludes."

from “Copy”,"translated from the Spanish by Robin Myers
To reassemble oneself. Proactivity, opportunism: an order. 
A tongue,  leaving.   A gesture, setting sail:   a singular place. 
You’re the one who  answers  the interrogations,  the one who 
stops,  identity in hand,  at every checkpoint.  Copiously.  You, 
not I, are the loser.  Copiously.  The bad traffic, suspect of the 
rage spilling out onto the world.  You’re the one drowning in 
your own shadow.  You live because another five hundred sol-
diers  were  tasked   with  your  disappearance.  To  reassemble 
oneself.  You, not I, are the one who responds:  my chest hides 
nothing but the dark honey of the one with neither place nor exit.","You’re the one who answers  the interrogations,  the one with identity in hand,  at every checkpoint. You, not I, are the loser. The bad traffic, suspect of the  rage spilling out onto the world."
Satan,"Translated by George Dimitri Selim
Satan came to me in my dream
desirous to dispute with me.
With his frightful horns and flaming eyes
he got close to me.
“Go away!” I said, “Beat it, damn you!
Don’t disturb my thoughts.”  
“I came to entertain you,” he said,
“with my knowledge, skill, and experience.
Answer me! Who are you?”
“One of the sages of the earth,” I said,
“Or haven’t you heard of my fame?
I have filled the world with poetry
Won’t you softly murmur my poems in hell?”
He burst out laughing
at my talk in surprise and scorn.
“Is there hope for wisdom on earth,
or for goodness from its evil people?
If people were just
they would exalt my value in their hearts.
When God created them,
He knew that they would disobey Him forever.
He built them hell,
and chose me to punish them and take revenge.
It’s because of them that He threw me in the abyss,
and I lost my might, authority, and power.
Between them and my Lord I was the victim.
Woe unto them!
The fire of hell did not frighten them,
nor did they learn from my fall.
They persisted in their doom,
disturbing God’s peace and mine,
and my patience.
Since they erected hell among themselves
my home is vacant of devils.
They all reside in people’s souls,
striving for evil and harm.
Don’t you see them
making servants of fuel and wind,
flying in space like birds,
hurling fire at mankind,
heedless of harm and destruction?
Don’t you see them on earth
surging and agitated like lions and leopards?
Don’t you see them
making the whales captives,
causing death to rage,
and the interior of the seas to tremble?
How could Moses think
that the Lord created man
– from the very beginning – in His image?
I die of shame
when they say that they are my followers.”
In the intensity of my anger
I struck Satan for despising men.
But when I woke up
and my eyes wandered over the newspaper,
and saw life a torrent of fire
in a hell of horrors and dangers, I said:
“Contentious though they might be
Satan’s words are true.”","Satan came in a dream to dispute with me. He said: “Is there hope for wisdom on earth, or for goodness from its evil people?” “I die of shame when they say that they are my followers,” he said."
The Two Brothers,"In the grotto the forest designed,
   Where the fire-fly first dreamed of the sun
And the cricket first chirped to the blind
    Zoophyte,—in the cave of the mind
    We were born and our cradle is one.
We are brothers : together we dwelt
    Unknown and unheard and unseen
For aeons ; together we felt
The urge of the forces that melt
    The rocks into willowy green.
For aeons together we drifted
    In the molten abysses of flame,
While the cycles our heritage sifted
From the vapor and ooze, and uplifted
    The image that now bears our name.
I am God : thou art Man : but the light
    That mothers the planets, the sea
Of star-dust that roofs every height
Of the Universe, the gulfs of the night,—
    They are surging in thee as in me.
 But out of the Chaos, to lead us,
    The Giants that borrow our eyes
And lend us their shoulders, must heed us;—
They yield us their purpose, they deed us
    Forever the worlds and the skies. ","We were born and our cradle is one. Together we felt the urge of the forces that melt the rocks into willowy green. The Giants that borrow our eyes and lend us their shoulders, must heed us."
A Sufi Song,"My heart ’s the field I sow for thee,
For thee to water and reap;
My heart ’s the house I ope for thee,
For thee to air and dust and sweep;
My heart ’s the rug I spread for thee,
For thee to dance or pray or sleep;
My heart ’s the pearls I thread for thee,
For thee to wear or break or keep;
My heart ’s a sack of magic things—
Magic carpets, caps and rings—
To bring thee treasures from afar
And from the Deep.","My heart ’s the field I sow for thee,                For thee to water and reap;                My heart’s a sack of magic things—                Magic carpets, caps and rings—                To bring thee treasures from afar                And from the Deep. My heart ‘s the rug I spread for thee.                For thy to dance or pray or sleep;                                 ‘My heart is the pearls I thread for thee’"
Renunciation,"At eventide the Pilgrim came
   And knocked at the Belovéd’s door.
“Whose there!” a voice within, “Thy name?”
   “ ’T is I,” he said.—“Then knock no more.
As well ask thou a lodging of the sea,—
There is no room herein for thee and me.”
The Pilgrim went again his way
   And dwelt with Love upon the shore 
Of self-oblivion; and one day
   He knocked again at the Belovéd’s door.
   “Whose there?”—“It is thyself,” he now replied,
And suddenly the door was opened wide.","At eventide the Pilgrim came and knocked at the Belovéd’s door. “Whose there!” a voice within, “Thy name?” “ ’T is I,” he said."

She sits upon a rock along the stream
     That heard the whisper of her first Desire,
Washing the faded garment of her Dream,
     Which she had often carried to the Dyer—
     The Dream of her self-centred lyric fire.
And in the flowing, scarlet wounds of Twilight,
     Expiring on Aurora’s drooping wings
Beneath the secret scimitar of Night,
     She dyes again her garment, while she sings
     Of new-born love, though to self-love she clings.

He seeks the path of glory in the noon
     Of self-intoxication, dreaming still
Of power,—wondering why the sun and moon
     Are not yoked to the chariot of his will.
     His soul, a clinging vine, his mind, an ill,
He beats against the peaks of earth-bound dreams,
     Subsisting on the thistles of his heart,
But ever seeking, in the fitful gleams
     Of his own fire, self-admiration’s mart
     To mend his horn or whet his venomed dart.
                                 III
They walk together in the golden vast
     Of vision-haunted, soul-alluring sands,
Beholding the illusions of the past
     Among the ruins of deserted lands:—
     Together, although neither understands
The groping purpose of the other; and yet,
     While in their hearts the gods of conflict nod,
They gloze and smile, dissembling their regret:
     Love, on the Road of Make-Believe, they prod, 
     He going to the dogs and she, to God. ","The story is about a young woman and her self-centred lyric fire. She sings of new-born love, though to self-love she clings. The story ends with her going to the dogs and she to God."
Throbbings,"translated by George Dimitri Selim
Zaynab complained against me
to the judge of love.
“He has sly eyes,” she told him,
which roam around me
to devour my beauty.
Judge of love!
I am not safe anymore.
“I think his eyes are two bees
raiding the honey
which sweetens my lips.
I see them as two eagles
hovering in space,
descending to snatch me.
I think, and from my fear,
I think strange things.
God knows how much I suffer from my thoughts.
“He invaded me with his eyes
and, as if this weren’t enough,
he tried to lower my standing among people.
Hypocritically, he said
that I have stolen my beauty from the universe,
and that it was not created naturally in me.
That I have plundered the morning for a face,
the dusk for hair,
uniting both in me.
That from the gardens
I have stolen the flowers for cheeks
—my cheeks are rosy.
That I have covered my neck with pure snow,
and that my eyes are tinted with narcissus.
“When my voice enchanted him
he denied it, and said:
‘It’s a nightingale singing in the garden.’
With sword-like glances I struck him,
he said, and in his deep-red blood
I dyed my finger tips
and in his poems he chanted alluding to me.
So people said:
‘His meanings are necklaces of pearls.’
Lord of verdicts!
Administer your justice between us.
Enough of his straying in love.
I’ve had enough!”
When the time of complaint was over,
the judge asked me:
“What is your answer,
you who are so passionately in love?”
I said:
“I find…that I am a criminal.
My insanity may not be deferred.
She has dispossessed me
of mind and heart.”","Zaynab complained against her husband to the judge of love. She said: “He has sly eyes,” she told him, “which roam around me’"

swahili beating out of speakers, dancing with a crowd of strangers
wondering how love has done nothing more to my body other than deform
the left side of my chest

running above ground and against the sky, before night wraps around fulton
an old woman kissing the bus driver’s cheek
green tennis balls poured over the courts on malcolm x
a little Black girl i do not know shouting adios amigo as she crosses the street

The Sufi,"Lulled in the purple darkness is my soul,
Behind the curtain, Allah, of my sight,
Where recreative waves of wonder roll
From sad seas of color over dead seas of light :—
I close my eyes and lo, the laden Night
Stops at the ivory gate to pay thy toll
               To my soul.
And with it Wealth in Destitution’s van,
And power in the chariot of Dole,
And Fame upon the skeleton she stole
From Death, Ambition, too, amidst her clan,
Spurring her jaded nag :—the Caravan 
Of Life is at the gate to pay thy toll
               To my soul. 
They pass : I open my eyes : and as I try
To con the cruel pages of the scroll
Which Censure left in fragments at their goal,
Then suddenly, illumining the sky,
A form of grace and beauty I descry.
’T is Love, O Allah, come to pay thy toll
               To my soul. 
But once, while lingering in the doleful shades,
Among the fallen, wine-stained colonnades
Of what was once thy temple, where still troll,
With languid step, the spirit of pagan maids,
I saw thee, Allah, coming though the glades
With food of love and from thy scrip I stole
           A jasmine for my hungry soul.","A form of grace and beauty I descry. Lulled in the purple darkness is my soul, behind the curtain, Allah, of my sight, says the poet."

It’s been 300 days since I first laid in your arms
First felt the chill of your kiss on my skin 
You brought me to the thin line between life and death
Between frostbite and heat exhaustion 
You taught me balance
Patience
Compassion
And when you stretched your arms around us
You taught us safety
What it meant to create security with our own bodies
Voices 
So for you 
I am every child who imagined someday you’d be free
I am every prayer laid at your feet
These days 
I am hundreds of miles away 
But you still visit me in my dreams
We share ceremony with Niolopua
And in that realm 
You keep all my secrets
All my fears 
All I am too afraid or ashamed to say out loud
For my fellow kiaʻi
It’s been 300 days since we marked the boundaries
Lined our jurisdictions with the trembling tenor of our collective voice
Since we began to feed each other
In food
In spirit
In care
For you
I am everything that cannot be broken
I am your first pinky promise
I am the incoming swell
I am every bit of love you taught me to lay at her feet
I am songs between stories, between tears
I am the water we fought to protect
That we shared 
Together
In the bitter cold of night
When we worried
No one else was coming","May 2020 marks 300 days since I first laid in your arms. I am every child who imagined someday you’d be free. For you, I am everything that cannot be broken."

Virus sets fire after fire blazing the eco of the monarch trees kissing the clouds

The root of eco means home home once knew and grew alongside of ancient 

Sequoias who mediated sun and rain and song. 

But the children disappear somewhere 

And the forests forever scorched 

Virus asks what matters 

The children nick-named the cage—

The Freezer 

Lay on freezing floors 

Try to sleep  

On 

Concrete

When

The 

Children 

Cannot            be.          
 
Human?

It is not over. Border Control pulled the children out of their parents’ arms.  
Children stolen for private prisons to boom.   Seven Indigenous children 
died inside the prisons.  ACLU reunited a few families.  It is not over.  
The parents are looking for them, year after year looking for them. 
Who counts the missing?  Reporters fail to find a paper-trail.    
No.  database.  to count the Disappeared in America.  
Yesterday’s news.  No longer newsworthy.  
But they have stories—real cliffhangers.  
The child no longer remembers her eyes. 
Not even grandmother’s or grandfather’s, 
or big sister’s or brother’s, or cousin’s.
Lungs of sorrow catch the mourning 
molecules fueling Virus.

The children laugh at us. The children hear what we will not. 
They ask me. Auntie, you can’t hear that? What about now? Now?  
Can you hear the fiesta near those old woods by the old meeting house? 
We can hear those ghosts singing and dancing for—Maria, 
the great great niece of Uncle Lucas. She is about to walk.  
Graduating with Honors from UC Hastings College of Law 
in the heart of the Tenderloin in Immigration Law.  
Her parents lived to see her walk.  
Listen to her words.  
Forty years ago her parents crossed the Rio Grande before sunrise 
but in those days—in those days on the side of mercy—the others knew
brought the people water, food, blankets and a change of clothes.
           
What if our children made it to their thirteenth birthday?   
Were they not born to dream? A lawyer or a judge or a chef, or a poet.  
The children could have dreamed to celebrate with Maria.  
To see her walk so the ancestors could live.
Maybe the children dreamed the old revolutionary road 
unblocking the path to that old meeting house 
in the woods. There once was a path 
to make it, to give back.  ","Border Control pulled the children out of their parents’ arms. The children hear what we will not. They ask me. Auntie, you can’t hear that? What about now?"
Love in a Time of Covid-19,"a variant of Pablo Neruda’s Sonnet XVII
I don’t love you as if you were penicillin, 
insulin, or chemotherapy drugs that treat cancer,
I love you as one loves the sickest patient:
terminally, between the diagnosis and the death. 
I love you as one loves new vaccines frozen 
within the lab, poised to stimulate our antibodies,
and thanks to your love, the immunity that protects 
me from disease will respond strongly in my cells.
I love you without knowing how or when this pandemic 
will end. I love you carefully, with double masking. 
I love you like this because we can’t quarantine 
forever in the shelter of social distancing, 
so close that your viral load is mine,
so close that your curve rises with my cough.","A variant of Pablo Neruda’s Sonnet XVII. I don’t love you as if you were penicillin or chemotherapy drugs that treat cancer. I love you without knowing how or when this pandemic will end. ILove you carefully, with double masking."
Remembering,"How you bowed
to the new moon
of every month
Morning brings
the smell of rain
and incense burning
Traveler’s palm
waves at 
the top of the hill
Each spring
we returned to the city
where you were born
What happened
to the pocket watch
from another century
And what became of
the penknife used
to sharpen the pencils
The trees you 
first planted
are all gone now
Reading by
the glowworm light
of a kerosene lamp
The north side of the house
stays cool while the south side
burns with the sun
Not content to love
the singing thrush you
call it by another name
The dogs are silent 
even though
the moon is full
Remembering
when we 
were one","Morning brings the smell of rain and incense burning. The north side of the house stays cool while the south sideburns with the sun. Not content to love the singing thrush, you call it by another name."

Badruddin,"Seek what you shall e’er possess,
O Badruddin,
Although it be a will-o’-the-wisp
Of the Unseen,
Which you may never behold
Until my suns and satellites are cold.
And in the seeking you shall find
The hidden jewels of the soul and mind ;
And every jewel shall reveal
Things divine
Even in a Sufi’s logic wheel,
Yea, even in the lowing kine.
The eyewash, O lone Badruddin, I bring
Is of the first dews of the first-born spring.
Apply it and behold!
Your dog-bitten sandals are transformed into gold ;
Your staff, sand-eaten and far-wandering,
Is bursting into foliage, blossoming.
Bearing fruits of wondrous lush and glow ;
And underneath the heavy-laden tree
A maid, whose face dispels all human woe,
Is cooking sesame for you and me.
  Cast off the garments of the world
And wear the sacred shades,
Whose color of contentment never fades,
And sit beside me with the golden fawn,
Whose name is Eternal Dawn.
  O thou Beloved, every word of thine
Is like a draught of purple wine ;
Every syllable
Is like the singing of the bulbul.
More potent are they than the magic lore
Which to the blind the sight restore,
As now to one, who through a pilgrim old,
Is but an infant in the cradle of love.
Yea, O thou incomparably Sweet,
Thy words are to mine eyes a heating kohl,
Musk to my nostrils, balm to my soul,
Strengthening ointments to my feet.
And what, in the stores and treasures of the world,
Is equal unto this?
Wealth and Beauty, Fame and Power,
They are but mirages in the boundless waste
That separates me from thee—for an hour.
  Once I tarried at a Well in an Oasis fair
But in the cup I lifted to my lips
I saw the image of thy wrath
And my despair :—
I dashed against a rock the common clay
And hastened away.
  Now, O thou Beloved, I come to thee :
With thy beauty drunk and dumb ;
Burdened with thy wealth, and lame ;
Ushered by thy liveried Fame ;
In thy glory garbed I come.
But I tremble at thy threshold lest the thorns in my feet
The story of my sacrifice repeat ;
I tremble at thy threshold lest the flowers of my heart
Betray the painted lips of conscious art ;
I tremble at thy threshold lest the eyes
That long have sought to behold but once thy face,
Deserve not even thy shadow to embrace.","O Badruddin, I bring you the eyewash of the first-born spring.Apply it and behold! Your dog-bitten sandals are transformed into gold. Your staff, sand-eaten and far-wandering, is bursting into foliage, blossoming."

"[The city breaks in houses to the sea, uneasy with waves,]","The city breaks in houses to the sea, uneasy with waves,
And the lonely sun clashes like brass cymbals.
In the streets truck-horses, muscles sliding under the steaming hides,
Pound the sparks flying about their hooves;
And fires, those gorgeous beasts, squirm in the furnaces,
Under the looms weaving us.
At evening by cellars cold with air of rivers at night,
We, whose lives are only a few words,
Watch the young moon leaning over the baby at her breast
And the stars small to our littleness.
The slender trees stand alone in the fields
Between the roofs of the far town
And the wood far away like a low hill.
In the vast open
The birds are faintly overheard.","The city breaks in houses to the sea, uneasy with waves. The lonely sun clashes like brass cymbals. In the streets truck-horses, muscles sliding under the steaming hides."

Good Grief,"after the 2021 Texas Winter Storm
I’ll admit that I’ve never thought about frostbite.
Trauma of the blood, a thing to be avoided when heat goes out for an entire state.
I don’t know where to place this grief, this sweltering state freezing, politicians breezing over to a country that doesn’t have tissue choked out by its winter yet.
The sky can only do what it does.
The American government can only do what systems driven by green paper, violence & ache can do.
The trees bloom over dead bodies, missing.
The sound of hands rubbing, engines purring, hopes that gas lights or chafing or the rapture won’t come first may quiver in my blood forever.
I am Black but maybe I am doomed.
Memory flashes like a computer screen; I see the zoom link expand. Colleagues process whatever failure number of a thousand this was this year and I can only remember white.
Six inches deep, sunken into my boots all over.
The timeline of friends stranded, impending doom of electricity shutting off, water pressure slipping into nothing every hour, pipes bursting on top of all that white.
I haven’t recovered from seeing things that too-closely resemble holes in a graveyard.  
I haven’t forgotten the project is due in 2 weeks.
My therapist says take it easy as if capitalism is listening. As if the body will ever forget what it is given.
I am Black which is history, personified.
I used to listen to Pilot Jones fondly. With all this frostbite on my fingers, I’m not sure if I can type.
I cannot finish another sentence on unity.
What is unified about ERCOT letting us freeze? Knowing how to fix the problem & not doing it; how does that form a Kumbaya circle?
If I made art about every pain I’ve felt unjustly, I would be swimming in accolades for great American books.
I would take back every word I’ve written if it ended this.
America is the worst group project.
I’m writing a great American poem about suffering.
How much is going without food that isn’t canned for a week worth?
The absence of snow feels like betrayal. My memory mixes with American delusion. 
I can’t believe half the things that I’ve been through.
Ice cold, baby, I told you; I’m ice cold.
Who said it first, Frank Ocean or Christopher Columbus?
I’ve never been taught how to adequately mourn the nights spent bitching about a brisk wind; the night we almost got stranded trying to get to J before the cold swallowed them whole.
I want to give everything I’ve been handed a good cry. Red skin & chapped lips deserve it.  
Good grief, what has Texas done to me.
An article features a person walking past tents near I-35. 
I can’t cry about the body but I feel it.
A highway splits a nation from its promise to be one.
Everything feels blurry and the palm trees have died.
Everything transported here withers away eventually.
6 months later and I haven’t been able to shovel out my sadness.
A news report said that it’s safe to go back to work. & I listen, because what else can you do in 6 inches of white.
The snow melted and I still feel frostbitten.
There are no heroes in a freeze-frame changing nothing.
I pose begrudgingly. Say cheese & then write this.
I’m not a survivor; just still breathing.
I remember grief, love’s grand finale.
What else do we have if not the memory of life before this?
I cannot tell you how many lives I’ve lost to mourning, but I can tell you that the sky does what it does.
Let’s go for a walk & touch the trees that survived like us.
Let’s write a future more joyful & less inevitable in segments of leaves.
Anything we dream will be better than this.",The Texas Winter Storm left thousands of people without power and water in the state. CNN.com’s John Sutter has written a poem about the effects of the storm. The poem is called ‘I am Black’ and is written in the form of a poem.
I Suffer a Phobia Called Hope,"translated from the Arabic by Fady Joudah
Each time I hear that word
I recall the disappointments
that were committed in its name:
the children who don’t return,
the ailments that are never cured,
the memory that’s never senile,
all of them hope crushed
beneath its wings as I smash
this mosquito on my daughter’s head.

It’s their only staple and inheritance.

and each return
a punctured lung.",The grieving have only the unknown. Pain has no logic. All things redeem the grieving except your rational questions. translated from the Arabic by Fady Joudah.
The United States of Montessori,"for Oray
We sat Indian style, & sang our pledge
to Audubon, painted birds on every wall,
& heard mirage when our teachers said
mural. We stole soccer balls from French
exchange, spiked them on the walkway
& yelled touchdown. My friend, where
are you now? We tripped over tree roots
racing to the playground, walked the sea
of wood chips to the plastic ship’s eye
& wheel. We bartered Super Donuts for
extra cartons of chocolate milk, played
duck, duck, duck, duucck, duuuuccckkk
goose. We vamoosed around a sunken
circle of laughter. We were hedgehogs,
were road runners & sombrero mice.
We were bullets, the Flash & every Green
Lantern; the Black ones, the White ones,
the alien ones too.","We were hedgehogs, road runners & sombrero mice. We were bullets, the Flash & every GreenLantern. We bartered Super Donuts for extra cartons of chocolate milk."
Praise poem,"The dog through the window walks unashamed,
moving to consume the love nearest by.
Pushing their head infinitely to the stranger,
not fearing the talking sun. A flea walks up
to my cup and floats as if on ice
hovering above, on, above. I push it away,
and it flickers into the air. Just yesterday, I saw
a woman give a visitor a handful of fruit.
Going into her kitchen, there were persimmons
and tangerines on the counter, lemons tarrying on the floor,
nothing living in the rightful container.
Their hands were so heavy they had to push them together
to hold it all. The window dog is much like
the Tinder dogs is much like a screen playing fire.
I know the men are good because they are near
the dogs. I know the fire is good
because I’ve felt alone without.
The day I moved to LA I saved the plane ticket from home.
It’s sentimental to imagine another monochromatic lifetime.
Still, I have memory to place her foothold in meaning.
Moten says the settler is not someone who goes to someplace
that’s not their own the settler is someone who goes someplace
and tries to make it their own. If ownership, then reconstructive
surgery. The store I’m in, or this world, keeps asking
if I want my receipt. A prescient child’s hand
holding an acorn. I have no need for innocence.
It’s becoming less hard to imagine the dignity
of standing up and leaving a seat empty for someone new.","The day I moved to LA I saved the plane ticket from home. The window dog is much like a screen playing fire. The store I’m in, or this world, keeps asking if I want my receipt. I have no need for innocence."
To Abu’l-Ala,"In thy melancholy’s pensive Fancy
    Wisdom rolled its beauteous stars and moons,
Just as in my riotings of pleasure
    Thy lone midnights roll into my noons.
Abu’l-Ala, in thy glorious darkness
    Didst thou not remember unborn me?
In thy journey to the farthest planets
    Didst thou not a burdened shadow see?
Ay, behind the portals of Saturnus
    Secretly the cup to thee I passed;
Long, long after this cup thou returnest
    Filled with gems of fancy and recast.
In thy Prison a thousand Yamen weapons
    Thou didst forge for the oppressed and weak:
In my attic a thousand Beauty roses
    I pluck for thee from a Yankee cheek.","Abu’l-Ala, in thy glorious darkness, didst thou not remember unborn me? I pluck for thee from a Yankee cheek. Filled with gems of fancy and recast."
In Memory of E. M. EL—K.,"When my parched lips upon thy princely brow,
    Placid as tropic mead, as glacier cold,
Imprinted a last farewell, where wert thou­—
    Where didst thy soul its loveliness unfold?
Can’t be that in some undiscovered sphere
    The Muses sing their souls to thine in bliss?
Can’t be that when I kiss thy forehead here
    A thousand angels echo there my kiss?
What is this mask, where is the soul, O where,
    And from these eyes, O God, where went the light?
My silence cries within me in despair,
    My reason’s sinking in this sea of Night.
Esau, I am beside thee now alone,
    I dare not weep, I dare not even breathe;
But through the stillness something hither blown
    Makes of thine amber locks a golden wreath.
Life flutters in thy hair as in mine eyes;
    Death can not choke the breeze that whispers there
A word of hope; beneath my breath will rise
    A hair with God eternity to share
The noon and eve of Life thou didst not see,
    But in its Dawn thou didst anticipate
What jealous Night would not permit to be,
    What pain and suffering never could abate.
Shall I strew on thee faded blossoms, Brother,
    Or fiery buds consumed by their own flame,
Or myrrh and myrtle from our Mountain-mother,
    Or golden rods that whispered oft thy name?
Or, at the shrine of Liberty and Love,
    Where thou didst worship ardently and die,
Shall I now join the gods come from above
    With thy sweet songs this shrine to beautify?
Ye sapling-pines of star-kissed Lebanon,
    Ye cedars laden with a wealth of years,
Send with the mist of dawn and the rising sun
    Your garlands, and your incense, and your tears.","The poem was written as a last farewell to Esau, who died in Placid, New York. Esau wrote: “My silence cries within me in despair, my reason’s sinking in this sea of Night”"
Allah Wa Ana,"Though I’m God, thou art man, we are one,
    We are all and we shall ever be;
Though the light of my sky thou didst shun,
Thou shalt love me ere thy course is run,
    As forever I live loving thee.
Thou art mine, I am thine and the fire
    Of my breath all thy regions shall warm,
Ere the life in thy soil shall expire,
Ere the seeds of thy basest desire
    From their prison break out and take form.
Thou wilt doubt and deny me forsooth
    And rejoice in thy vanity’s power;
Thou wilt die on the breast of my truth,
In the end thou wilt laugh at thy youth,
    And its wine although old will be sour.

    As I am with thy mother at prayer;
I was with thee when thou didst defy
My hell and my earth and my sky,
    And I love non the less those that dare.

Onward Keep,"Onward keep! Forget the self that cried:
     “This world’s a forest choked with ice and
           snow;
No spark of fire through it can ever ride,
    No human flame in it can ever glow.”
And keeping onward, now, I find
    The golden leaves of yesterday
All safely hidden from the wind

And on the shivering boughs
    New leaves and tender sprout;
They crown the winter’s brows,

Near the Cascades,"            Hold back thy lips, I pray;
             Just let me rest this way;
            My soul is in the spray
Arising from the silvery cascades murmuring
            farewell to the day.
            Thy kisses ’neath a sigh
            Of mine extinguished lie;
            O friend, I choke, I die:
Pray, let me raise my head to see the parting
            Light, the vivid sky,
            If every kiss of thine
            Is safety kept with mine
            For one for whom I pine,
Wouldst thou, contented with the taking, call my
            love a love divine?
            Ay, and for every tear
            Thou sheddest when I’m near
            I shed a score to hear
Her echo my desire’s sigh, albeit she is not thy
            peer.
            If I were but a reed,
            Or but a fern or weed,
            This would not be my creed;
But prick thou these cold slips and all the roots
            of me in heaven will bleed.
            Thy burning breath is creeping
            All over me; ’t is leaping
            Into my bones and sweeping
Their ashes out, up and into mine eyes, alas!
            the awful reaping.
            No longer do I fear,
            Nor see, nor feel, nor hear;
            No longer am I near;
If thou wilt quench thy flame, kiss now the lips
            that were to thee so dear.
            As well kiss thou the grass
            On which I lay, alas!
            Like me, thou too wilt pass;
One kiss will turn thy lips to ashes and one tear,
            thine eyes to glass.
            Beneath this hemlock tree
            A clod I leave to thee;
            But over land and sea
My soul is rising, rising, rising, searching for the
            gods that be.
            But gods have lived, and lied,
            And loved, and fell, and died;
            And like me too they cried
For mercy at the snow white feet of Beauty’s
            daughter,
            Beauty’s bride.
            And when from Beauty’s spell
            Her soul is free, she’ll dwell
            In mine, the storm to quell;
In mine she’ll rise to realms of bliss, or swiftly
            whirl into the deepest hell.","The poem was written in the first half of the 20th century. It is a collection of verses written by British poet William Butler Yeats. Some of the lines include: ‘My soul is in the spray’ and ‘Hold back thy lips, I pray'"
Written After Reading King Lear,"Long is his course, O master of our woes,
And joys, and tears, our passions and desires,
In nature’s school—in hell-begotten fires;
Dread is the agony and fell the throes
Which with the Night and Storm he undergoes,
While Treason in his robes herself attires,
And Love beneath adultery’s sheet expires,
And mocked Sincerity sincerer grows.
To vie with wailing winds and weeping clouds
And valleys shrieking in the fangs of storms,
This Human Hurricane thou didst create;
But just as soon as Death this horror shrouds,
I hear the distant cry of fiery forms,
Ay, and the creaking of hell’s deepest gate.","“Long is his course, O master of our woes, and joys, and tears, our passions and desires, in hell-begotten fires.” “I hear the distant cry of fiery forms, and the creaking of hell’s deepest gate”"

But unlike her, alas, thy love’s complaint of
          dearth:
“Thou hast no strength to give what I demand
          of thee.”
Thy love hath heard the many whispered prom-
          ises of every soul;
His birth methinks is nigh coeval with the
          birth of time:
He lives in death throughout the ages, and his
          goal
Is hidden in the faded flowers from every
          clime.
His soul is deeper than the sea and deepest cav-
          erns in its bed;
’T is higher than the highest sky above our
          own;
’T is purer than the morning dew a-dripping
          from the salvias red;
’T is mightier than the four winds, blowing
          from every zone.
This love hath offered me the keys of all his halls
          and towers,
And to my heart with clinging kisses he ap-
          pealed;
But, ah, forgive me God! must I the sweetest
          flowers
Refuse because they do not grow in Beauty’s
          field?","The book is called ‘The Love of God’ and is written in the form of a short story. The story is about the love of a man who lives in death throughout the ages. The author’s love for God is as tender as a drooping rose, he writes."
Repentance,"When tears wash tears and soul upon soul leaps,
    When clasped in arms of anguish and of pain,
When love beneath the feet of passion creeps,
    Ah me, what do we gain?
When we our rosy bower to demons lease,
    When Life’s most tender strains by shrieks are slain,
When strife invades our quietude and peace,
    Ah me, what do we gain?
When we allow the herbs of hate to sprout,
    When weeds of jealousy the lily stain,
When pearls of faith are crushed by stones of doubt,
    Ah me, what do we gain?
When night creeps on us in the light of day,
    When we nepenthes of good cheer disdain,
When on the throne of courage sits dismay,
    Ah me, what do we gain?
When sweetness, goodness, kindness all have died,
    When naught but broken, bleeding hearts remain,
When rough- shod o’er our better self we ride,
    Ah me, what do we gain?","When we allow the herbs of hate to sprout, what do we gain? When we allow pearls of faith to be crushed by stones of doubt, we gain doubt. When tears wash tears and soul upon soul leaps, what are we to gain?"
It was All for Him,"I strolled upon the Brooklyn Bridge one day,           
              Beneath the storm;
None but a lad in rags upon the way
I saw;––there on a bench he lay
              Heedless of form.
He seemingly was reading what the Shower
   Was publishing upon the Bridge and down
          the Bay;
Yet he was writing, writing at this hour,–––
   Writing in a careless sort of way.
Upon a pad he scribbled and as fast the rain
   Retouched, effaced, corrected and revised.
Was he recording Nature’s solemn strain,
   Or sketching choristers therein disguised?
Whatever it be, I found myself quite by his side;
   My nod and smile he pocketed and wrote
         again;
“Read me your drizzling stuff,” I said, and he
         replied:
“I’ve written a check in payment for this
         shower of rain.”","A lad in rags lay on a bench on the Brooklyn Bridge. He was writing, writing at this hour, in a careless sort of way."
Midnight Mood,"There's one upon whose youthful breast I fain would die: 
     My soul upon her lingering lips through mine I'd pour
     In torrents that would reach and thrill Love's every shore—
In floods that drown the earth and rise to drown the sky. 
But how can I? Alas, the leaves must shield the flower, 
    And silent see her proferring to the butterfly
    Her cheeks, her honeyed lips, her soul,—O how can I?
In all the worlds, to change my being, is there no power? 
How oft I rise at night to probe the human laws, 
    My beating temples all my waking hours recording! 
    And nor solution, nor repose my task affording,—
How oft my carnal silence cries for the bliss that was! 
The bliss that generous nature gives, that man denies—
   A bliss that's chained in idle words and damned codes
   And creeds and customs creeping in their dark abodes—
The bliss that's lost within an endless maze of lies. 
Pray, tell me, must the North Wind blow and sweep by rule? 
    Must he the virgin ponds and springs and rills avoid? 
    See how the ocean, panting, rising, overjoyed, 
Holds out her arms to him,—why not the limpid pool? 
And thou, O human Ocean,—would that I could give 
   In equal measure, when beneath me thou art parting! 
   O, generous, fiery soul, in love though I am wanting, 
My flesh, within thy passion's hearth, will glow and live. 
Thou art the twilight; I'm the dawn; yet we shall meet 
   And flood the firmament with fire and rainbow beauty. 
   No unfed sun or moon shall rob us of our booty, 
And if the gods should frown,—is not the rebellion sweet? 
But ah, live Twilight! why cannot the Dawn be true? 
   Why can't I quaff from thy sad lips, as thou, from mine? 
   Why can't this heart, forgetting once, as well be thine? 
How can I my most holy passion tame, subdue? 
That youthful breast, imprisoned, I see through thine own; 
    Those Eastern eyes cannot be hidden by thy flame; 
    That form, as I am in thine arms—O, do not blame—
In mine I fancy,—let me die in shame alone!

The Sister of Death,"Ah, talk to me of something else, I pray;
I’m weary of the dreams that bring nor sleep,
Nor rest, nor love, nor something from the deep,
Where buried are the gods of yesterday;
Ah, talk to me of Death that takes away
My little sorrows, as they hide and peep,
My little joys, as they disport and leap,
My little vanities, my budless May.
The burden of my virtues and my sins,
The burden of authority that grins
at every effort, ah, the burden kills;
I know that Death a Sister hath, but where,
Where can I find thee, Love, when shall I share
The sweetness of the silence of the hills?","""I’m weary of the dreams that bring nor sleep, nor rest, nor love, nor something from the deep"" ""Where can I find thee, Love, when shall I share the sweetness of the silence of the hills?"""
A Bed of Flame,"I saw one day on the horizon grey,
      As with my load I wandered near the sea,
            A whiff of smoke embrace the sleeping sun;
            And just as their enchantment had begun,
      A lonely cloud that roved above the lea
Passed by their couch and hid them from the day.
I saw this and my soul, long silent, cried:
      “Would that I were the whiff of smoke
            Now sleeping with the sun!
In beds of flame, how often was I tried,—
      How often have I ’neath the stroke
            Of God or Satan shone!”","""I saw one day on the horizon grey, a lonely cloud that roved above the lea,"" writes the author. ""I saw this and my soul, long silent, cried: ‘Would that I were the whiff of smoke!’ """
"O, Sweet Sometime","O, sweet Sometime, the gardens bloom the while I wait;
Each moment melts a tear of joy before thy gate;
It is thy pleasure that I burn,—it is my fate,
O, sweet Sometime!
O, when the moment in this interval is born,
When through this sleeping splendor breaks the lingering morn,
And when thy sensual silence laughs my noise to scorn—
O, sweet Sometime!
Spare me the vacant moment yet,—O just awhile;
Expectancy, thy sweetest daughter, will beguile
My yearning hours; the shades reflected by her smile
Are now my haunts, O sweet Sometime.
The waiting while, O sweet Sometime, I can enjoy;
Thy heralding shadows every beating pang destroy,
And with their breath of musk and myrrh my soul they cloy,
O, sweet Sometime!
I tremble, I forget, I throb when once I hear
The dying interval announcing thou are near;
A touch, a groan, a kiss and thou wilt disappear,
With bitten lip, O, sweet Sometime!
And then the memory—O, how it will oppress!
Far sweeter is Expectancy—ah, let me press
The vigor from her limbs to mind; I’ll yet caress

A Better Woe,"Of all my desert days
Thou art the only one
Upon whose sandy face
A strip of pleasure’s foliage trembling grows;
Of all the winding ways,
Which with my rapture shone
But one can I retrace,
And there the barren breast of beauty glows.
Of all the dread desires,
That beat within me still,
One shakes the sacred fear
And hurls me into the arms of her below;
But oh, how life suspires—
How soon after the thrill
Of joy I shudder, I hear
My murmuring soul pine for a better woe.","""Of all my desert days                Thou art the only one upon whose sandy face                A strip of pleasure’s foliage trembling grows"" ""One shakes the sacred fear                And hurls me into the arms of her below; but oh, how life suspires"""
Disarmed Desire,"O, how the light drifts from the hemlock grove,
How in the night disarmed Desires do rove!
A sister to the dumb hydrangea thou,
A mystery born of the Then and Now.
The color on thy clouded face—ah me!
Is’t from the embers that still burn in thee?
Has not the forge of suffering robbed thee of
The flame with which weak mortals feed their love?
Wilt thou, no longer fancying the light,
Conjure a virgin flame from the darkest night?
And feed it with the salvias of a soul,
That would, but yet—alas! she seeks the Whole.
The hand that broke the screen, the hearth that lied,—
Where are they? Come, the path of truth is wide.
The silvery cataracts of roaring rills
Meander in the shadows of the hills;
And their bass music,—does it not arise
From that descent that leads up to the skies?
O how disarmed Desire uprises, how—
Does not the darkness crown the Lightning’s brow?
Yet how I wish, yet how I shrink, when I
Behold thee—ah, she’s ever in mine eye!
If thy pink, blue and golden hues disclose
The secret, might not that undo the rose?
Thou sister to the dumb hydrangea, when
Will all thy sombre musings rise again?
O, how the light drifts from the hemlock grove,
How in the night disarmed Desires do rove!","The color on thy clouded face—ah me!                Is’t from the embers that still burn in thee?                Has not the forge of suffering robbed thee of the flame with which weak mortals feed their love?                Conjure a virgin flame from the darkest night?                And feed it with the salvias of a soul, that would, but yet, seek the Whole."
A Serenade,"                               I

The moon hath said her sad good-bye, 
    My sleeping queen; 
And all the stars are wondering why
    Thou art unseen. 
Behold! abashed, they take to flight, 
As through the casement breaks thy light. 
                Arise, my dawn, arise! 
                Arise, my queen serene! 

                               II

The field of heaven is all thine own,

Just as my heart is thine alone, 
     Be near or far. 
So let thy face adorn the night. 
And flood it with thy dazzling light.

Resurrection,"The ghost of Winter stalks amidst the boughs
Of Spring and drags along his icy shroud;
The corn flowers and the wheat, with broken vows,
Are now beneath the storm untimely bowed.
O Winter, thou wert buried on the hills;
Thine epitaph was written with melted snow;
Thy skeleton is in the barren rills,
Where once thy silvery life-blood used to flow.
Why visits the glimpses of the sun
So soon, what message bring’st thou from the dead?
Why rudely interrupt the children’s fun
And havoc among the Guests of Summer spread?
Behold, the branches shiver, the blossoms fall;
The lilac in the leaves a shelter seeks;
Thy savage winds the Queen of May appal,—
They pale with summer’s dust her rosy cheeks.
Withhold the solemn music of thy gale
Until the golden notes of Spring are spun;
The opera in the trees is but begun,
O, drown it not with thy benighted wail.
For thee May’s winged madonnas will not sing,
Nor in thy presence will they now appear:
Begone, that their sweet voices may we hear—
Begone, the world to-day belongs to Spring.","""Winter, thou wert buried on the hills; thy epitaph was written with melted snow"" ""The ghost of Winter stalks amidst the boughs of Spring and drags along his icy shroud"" ""Behold, the branches shiver, the blossoms fall; the lilac in the leaves a shelter seeks"""
Nectar and Blood,"                        I
If I should worship at thine ancient shrine,
Where thy good sons, incensed by love of war,
Now clamor, as their fathers did of yore—
If I should sacrifice what is not mine,
Nor any living god’s, nor even thine—
If for the sake of honor I must pour
This cup of life upon thy barren shore,
How will it fare then with my love divine?

No! let thy sons go forth to burn and slay:
Let them for love of thee and glory smear
And tear the love of all that’s pure and dear;
Let them this loveless love in rage display;
I can not join them; no, I can not cheer
As they beneath my window pass to-day.
                        II
What care I for the tears the maudlin crowd
Sheds o’er my bier—for praise of Church and State—
For glory that remains within the gate
Of worldly things—for men’s esteem avowed—
For freedom that is not with love endowed—
For fame that lingers oft and comes too late,
When these the sorrow of my love create
And haunt her with the shadow of my shroud?

How cowardly, self-centered have I grown—
How dead to true and noble feelings all?
Why not, when they the human soul enthrall—
Why not, when they the beast in man enthrone?
I cling to love, and with love I will fall,
Unwept, unsung, unhonored and unknown.

What will these kings and war-lords of the land
And all their ministers of murder fell
Do with their arms and fleets—all tools of hell—
If every son of man resolve to stand
A-wielding, king-like, in his home the wand,
Beside the ones he loves and honors well?
Can force this gentle host of peace compel,
When loving hearts their amber wings expand?

O love, though hounded, outlawed we may be—
Though Slander, dagger-drawn, be on our trail—
Though Hatred with her hydra tongues should rail
At us, and though left sinking in the sea
Of ostracism, ay, never will I quail,
But will now and forever cling to thee.","""I cling to love, and with love I will fall, unwept, unsung, unhonored and unknown"" ""How cowardly, self-centered have I grown"" ""I will now and forever cling to thee"""

From me they all must steal, or beg, or borrow.","""Adele"" is the name of France's first-born of the fairest Muse. The song was written in the early 1960s."

Have I for such as thou; go home and feed
        Upon thy Song.”","The cricket to the corn-crake came one day, shivering, yet buzzing in his wanton way, and said: “I’m slainBy hunger, brother, turn thou not from me”"
Upon the Peak of Sanneen,"My soul and I, upon the peak
    Of Sanneen grim and grey,
Sat musing in the twilight of
    A sombre summer day.

“Great Saturn and the Moon are gone
    Together o’er the sea;
But will great Saturn e’er return
    Should he elope with thee?

Ah well, who knows? when thou art gone
    I, too, shall sink within the brine,—
I, too, shall sail above this peak
    And signal yonder groves of pine.

Behold the melancholy sky
    Of this forgotten land;
On this side are the valleys bleak.
    On this, the desert sand.”

“I hear the moaning of the wind,”
    My sad companion said;
“The snow is gathering in me
    And the night is overhead.

Long have we dwelt together, friend,
    In our sweet ennui;
But were I now to take my leave,
    Alas, what would I be?”

“O, think not of departing.
    Ah, too young I am to die;
I’ll find the magic wings; and there
    Still hangs a friendly sky.

Let us above these pines, and clouds,
    And scents awhile yet dwell;—
Where wouldst thou go, if thou wert now
    To sigh a last farewell?”

Thou seest the busy elements
    Dissolving one by one
The souls that are acquitted.
    For the all-absorbing sun.

Let’s sing the song of darkness then;
    Thy prison is the Whole;—
What canst thou do, where wilt thou go,
    What wilt thou be, my Soul?

Thou wouldst not be the air that weighs
    Upon the rising dust;
Thou wouldst not be the fog that chokes
    The air in savage lust.

Thou wouldst not be the clouds that block
    The smoke’s way to a star;
Nor linger in the guilty tears
    Of clouds before the bar.

Thou wouldst not be the rain that taunts
    The all-devouring sea,
Itself destroying many a nest
    In bush and rock and tree.

Thou wouldst not be the thunder’s tongue
    Spell-binding all the spheres;
Nor wouldst thou be the lightning blade
    That stabs and disappears.

Thou wouldst not be the dew that falls
    Alike on thorn and flower;
Nor even the morning zephyr
    That blows o’er den and bower.

Thou wouldst not be the virgin snow
    Set free from yonder clouds,
Only to melt beneath the feet
    Of surging human crowds.”

“No! none of these,” my Soul replied;
    “I’ll shiver ever thrall;
O let me rise, for I would be
    The sky above them all.”","My soul and I, upon the peak of Sanneen grim and grey, musing in the twilight of                    A sombre summer day. “Great Saturn and the Moon are gone o’er the sea; but will great Saturn e'er return? Should he elope with thee?”"
Hymn,"When storms arise
And dark'ning skies
    About me threat'ning lower,
To thee, O Lord, I raise mine eyes,
To thee my tortured spirit flies
    For solace in that hour.
The mighty arm
Will let no harm
    Come near me nor befall me;
Thy voice shall quiet my alarm,
When life's great battle waxeth warm—
    No foeman shall appall me.
Upon thy breast
Secure I rest,
    From sorrow and vexation;
No more by sinful cares oppressed,
But in thy presence ever blest,
    O God of my salvation.","""To thee, O Lord, I raise mine eyes, to thee my tortured spirit flies,"" he writes. ""No foeman shall appall me,"" he adds. ""In thy presence ever blest, O God of my salvation,"" he concludes."
Dissolution,"I languish in thy penetrating clasp, 
Just as a bird entangled on a bough 
    Shaken by the wind; 
Yet here would I be happy in the grasp
Of death; but in thy breast I'm hidden now, 
    And death is blind. 

I melt beneath thy storm of kisses, dear, 
Just as the gum upon the almond tree
Of melting when alone and far from thee: 
    Melts 'neath the rain; 
Yet would I melt to-night than live in fear 
    O, storm again! ","""I melt beneath thy storm of kisses, dear,                 Just as the gum upon the almond tree melting when alone and far from thee"" ""I languish in thy penetrating clasp,                  I would rather live in fear"""
Unadorned,"Regardless of the cries of priests and sages
I strove to give my bleeding soul her wages; 
   And each embrace or memory of one 
Is worth to me the treasures of the ages, 
Is worth to me the treasures of the ages. 

Each shadow of a kiss or fond embrace
Down in the depth of solitude I trace; 
   And in the corners of my darkest den
The fallen gods of pleasure find a place. 
The fallen gods of pleasure find a place. 

And though knee-deep I find myself in hell, 
And though the flames around my cheeks should swell, 
   I shall not loose my grip on Allah's throne, 
I shall not fall alone, I know full well. 
I shall not fall alone, I know full well. ","Despite the cries of priests and sages I strove to give my bleeding soul her wages. And though knee-deep I find myself in hell, I shall not loose my grip on Allah's throne."
Thy Smile,"Outside the gates of night, above the moon,
Where breatheth none but gods, where light alone 
Forever rules from his star-studded throne, 
Where Melancholy never reaches noon, 
And where the Pleiades their harps attune,—
There in the centre of the lightning zone, 
Upon the zephyr which the storm hath sown, 
Thou first wert formed with pleasure to commune.
And now in Pleasure's world, upon the face
Of bright and gay Bohemia's fairest child 
The zephyr dallies with the lightning flash; 
The smile divine, as well the subtle grace
Are deeply there impressed, by naught defiled—
There joy's received as well as paid in cash. ","""Pleasure's world, upon the face of bright and gay Bohemia's fairest child"" is one of the most famous songs of the 20th century."
Lilatu Laili,"At night on the radiant Rialto
   By the stars in their houses of glass,
I strolled with my soul in my pocket
   And prayed that my night might not pass; 
I have seen 'neath the high heels of Beauty
   My heart and my soul and my shame; 
That form! O, how often it lured me, 
   And how often I lost in the game! 
And how often I walked in the shadow 
   Of a Laila a mile and a mile! 
But the rapture and bliss of a vision
   Would end in a great gush of bile. 
To the hints that her garment would whisper 
    I have listened but I would not dare; 
I have seen every one of my fancies 
   Retreat in the dark of her hair. 
I have wished that each building around us 
   Was a cedar, a poplar, a pine; 
That the men and the women were statues, 
   And the rain that was falling was wine; 
That the lights were ethereal flowers; 
   That the cars were the nooks in the wood,—
""O, enough!"" she exclaimed as she kissed me, 
    ""This attic and couch are as good."" ","At night on the radiant Rialto I strolled with my soul in my pocket. And prayed that my night might not pass. I have seen 'neath the high heels of Beauty. My heart and my soul and my shame. O, how often it lured me."
Let Thine Eyes Whisper,"      Grieve not, for I am near thee; 
      Sigh not, for I can hear thee;
Wash from thy heart all memory of past wrong; 
      Doubt not that doubts besmear thee; 
      Speak not, for I do fear thee; 
Let thine eyes whisper love's conciling song. ","Wash from thy heart all memory of past wrong;  let thine eyes whisper love's conciling song. Grieve not, for I am near thee;  Sigh not,  I can hear thee."
Retribution,"How I did hold in deep contempt
   The slaves and queens of love! 
How I disguised my feelings when 
    I met a deer or a dove! 
How I did smile and sniff and rail 
    At lovers young and old; 
How I denied, in days gone by, 
    O love, thy charms untold! 
But now, alas! I find myself 
    In chains at Beauty's shrine: 
The chains whose power I have denied
   Are sapping, sapping mine. ","""How I disguised my feelings when I met a deer or a dove!"" he writes. ""But now, alas! I find myself  in chains at Beauty's shrine"""

Ever to Be,"My far cry, though no one should echo,—
    Though no one to listen should stand,
I shall dare with my burden the darkness
    And I shall not retreat from this land;
Though I’m hurled ’neath the feet of the millions,
    Who struggle their places to keep,
The sea-nymphs still bathe with my fancy
    And the Dryads still sweeten my sleep.
Though I’m crushed, cast away and forgotten,—
    Though I’m buried in the dust of their cars,
I can see through their madness above me,—
    I can feel the quick pulse of the stars;
Though my head be the foot-stool of tyrants,
    Though my back be a step to their throne,
I still dwell with the kings of Orion
    And I walk with the sun-queen alone.
Though the fire of my youth should consume me,—
    Though my body a brimstone should be,
I can draw on the clouds for their water,
    And behold! I’ve of water a sea;
And though roofless, and friendless, and hopeless
    And loveless, and godless I stand,
The waves of my Life shall continue
    To murmur and laugh on the Strand .","The sea-nymphs still bathe with my fancy. And the Dryads still sweeten my sleep. Though I’m crushed, cast away and forgotten.

to approach,"treatment belongs to water.
it designates the sum of all relations one has with another.
you might say the life schemed between two is treatment.
to treat water is to cure it for consumption, but your
treatment speaks volumes about your desire to bear witness.
to treat you like water, i’d have to assume you as essential and
      daily.
i aspire to this when i fall in love, that you be my water.
since we are both from here, we are a bit
contaminated, which treatment must consider.
i treat you like an island looks at another and understands
      water is power.
i know i’m mixing things, but treatment is the mixture of all
      the things
we did to each other when we they took our land, cut down
      our forests
and distributed our crops.
it isn’t a metaphor when i say crop.
sometimes it’s a metaphor when i talk about us and water.
it’s easy to get confused with so much barnacle language
stuck to our wall.
confusion is a way of getting close.
i come close, fail, and fall in love.
treatment is the sum of all relations had
with each person i knew on this island.
each i loved, to a greater or lesser degree.
if they hurt me or took my shirt,
they are still part of the treaty we signed.
    la aproximación
el trato pertenece al agua.
designa la totalidad de relaciones que tienes con otro.
se podría decir que la vida que se trama entre dos es trato.
tratar el agua es curarla para el consumo, pero tu
trato habla volúmenes de tus ganas de presenciarnos.
al tratarte como agua, te asumiría como esencial y cotidiana.
a esto aspiro cuando me enamoro, a que seas mi agua.
como somos los dos de aquí, estamos un poco
contaminados y el trato debe tomarlo en cuenta.
te trato como una isla que mira a otra isla y entiende que el
      agua es poder.
sé que mezclo cosas, pero el trato es la mezcla de todas las cosas
que nos hicimos cuando nos quitaron la tierra, talaron nuestros
      bosques     
y repartieron los frutos.
no es metáfora cuando digo fruto.
a veces es metáfora cuando hablo del agua y de nosotros.
es fácil confundirse con tanto lenguaje de percebe
pegado a nuestro muro.
confundirse es una manera de acercarse.
me aproximo, fallo y me enamoro.
el trato es la suma de las relaciones que tuve
con cada persona que conocí en esta isla,
a quienes amé en menor y mayor grado.
si me hirieron o me quitaron la camisa,
igual son parte del trato que firmamos.","treatment is the sum of all relations one has with another. Treatment is the mixture of all the things we did to each other when we took our land, cut down our forests, and distributed our crops."

Blessing,"for my son, enwombed
May you harvest your language from the alphabet of butterflies, 
may their wings brushstroke your name on translucent scrolls, 
filter air for your breath, teach you flight the way I can’t.  
May you preserve the wisdom with which you arrive, 
the metaphors through which you’ll first parse the world,
the moon always a ripe banana, always within reach.  
May your fingers tease and probe all truths.

wayward in their drift that, trapped, abrade the oyster’s flesh.  
Errant breather smothered into loveliness,

language loses meaning,
so bring your ear to the ocean floor.

call sister sister and lie awhile by the echo. 
While there, bless the echo and learn 
how to lie to me beautifully. ","For my son, enwombed for my son. May you harvest your language from the alphabet of butterflies. May their wings brushstroke your name on translucent scrolls. May they teach you flight the way I can't."

One Hundred Love Sonnets: XVII (I don’t love you as if you were a rose),"I don’t love you as if you were a rose of salt, topaz,
or arrow of carnations that propagate fire:
I love you as one loves certain obscure things,
secretly, between the shadow and the soul.
I love you as the plant that doesn’t bloom but carries
the light of those flowers, hidden, within itself,
and thanks to your love the tight aroma that arose
from the earth lives dimly in my body.
I love you without knowing how, or when, or from where,
I love you directly without problems or pride:
I love you like this because I don’t know any other way
        to love,
except in this form in which I am not nor are you,
so close that your hand upon my chest is mine,
so close that your eyes close with my dreams.

Te amo como la planta que no florece y lleva
dentro de sí, escondida, la luz de aquellas flores,
y gracias a tu amor vive oscuro en mi cuerpo
el apretado aroma que ascendió de la tierra.
Te amo sin saber como, ni cuándo, ni de dónde,
Te amo directamente sin problemas ni orgullo:
así te amo porque no sé amar de otra manera,
sino así de este modo en que no soy ni eres,

tan cerca que se cierran tus ojos con mi sueño.  ","Cien Sonetos de Amor: XVII (No te amo como if you were a rose of salt, topaz, or arrow of carnations that propagate fire)"
Tankas for what Comes Together,"At the seashore, wind
almost lifts our spindrift bodies,
sand scrapes our skin.
Let that sleek seal beat back the waves—
thunder amasses in cloud.
I do not believe in the failure of caring
for each other. How
can I when the cascading waves
gather us all in the rise?","I do not believe in the failure of caring for each other. At the seashore, wind almost lifts our spindrift bodies. Let that sleek seal beat back the waves."
Menopause,"For further reference: I go to love
like a fire engine to a three-alarm,                              flashing
and spinning, yelling across town. Nothing
to be afraid of: the ceiling falling,                                windows 
concave, doors bowed and stiff. My body 
parts fall to, like I was made                                        of the heat. 
Everyone watches, chest-clutching, pointing. 
Inhalation will surely be the cause of                         my death.
Urban myth says an aging vagina once
well-used will shrink from lack                                    of exercise.
I would think, instead, like the collar of a sweater,
stretched, gaping. Or a fish out                                   of water,
grasping for purchase. A soft pop every time
you check to see whether or not                                 it is dead.
I want a song to be written about me: black
pearls, sulfur, bronze-plated silver.                             It should

lit windows from the end of a driveway                     on the last note.","I want a song to be written about me: black pearls, sulfur, bronze-plated silver. I want a chorus that is a shout of     AAAAAHHHHH! A song about blood-soaked hands, a chorus of   shouting."
For the Bird Singing before Dawn,"Some people presume to be hopeful
when there is no evidence for hope,
to be happy when there is no cause.
Let me say now, I’m with them.
In deep darkness on a cold twig
in a dangerous world, one first
little fluff lets out a peep, a warble,
a song—and in a little while, behold:
the first glimmer comes, then a glow
filters through the misty trees,
then the bold sun rises, then
everyone starts bustling about.
And that first crazy optimist, can we
forgive her for thinking, dawn by dawn,
“Hey, I made that happen!
And oh, life is so fine.”","Some people presume to be hopeful                when there is no evidence for hope,                to be happy when there's no cause. I'm with them."
Remember the Puns & Brashbrandy,"for Jack Hirschman (1933-2021)
The words always came running out of your mouth
Tumbling, galloping
Pushing against one another as they took the final turn
The last hundred meters
Where form is lost 
& everyone becomes a futurist
Sacred words split into syllables & break apart
Yours never had wings affixed to them
Only the hammer & sickle 
Harnessed with gumshoe & printing press
Long gray hair alighting from your form
& that gait you had
As if you’d been riding motorcycles all night long
Bowlegged, rickety even 
Probably from kicking fascists in your sleep 
& the other death-headed sorts
You had the sparkle, loud & lavish laughter
Bellowing even
A clamor to stoke awake the fires inside
& push against the fulcrum of the dreadful state
In time, overtaken by the glow & tether of your arcanes
Where life mingled with apparitions 
It’s how you made memory & the present inseparable
Obsecrating all those pages turned 
Dog-eared & brittle after a stretch
To lay words before us, like crumbs
Four thousand pages later
Leaving a richer trail
I remember the raddled years
When you lived like a pauper
Grinning wide & showing off your crooked teeth
More beautiful than any others
The final words I whispered to you
That was wonderful 
Are still ringing in your ears
Though vibrating waves of compression
& rarefactions are dust now
Just in case, let me say it again
That was wonderful","The final words I whispered to you are still ringing in your ears,” writes Jack Hirschman. “It’s how you made memory & the present inseparable.”"
Vista,"What goes extinct while grazing on memory’s lawn in the sun? 
When you said, “I’d cut my tongue,” I grew a callus over your mouth.
Once, I tiptoed to catch a glimpse of you though I was not yours, 
but there was recognition through the window, my eyes knocking
on cleansed glass, as I closed further into sleep, into preludes,
away from you. Why am I speaking at all when what’s unsaid
between us is a rosette of moth wings, beating in the sky’s eardrum.  
I don’t flock to passions when I seek you; if all was taken, who would you be?  
Still, I know what I sensed as I watched you swim out from under the bridge
trying to sip the Pacific. If it wasn’t for the undercurrent, I’d have let
you go further, but the hour was a cool blue cluttered with your lips.  
There’s a story you know: it begins with your right hand over mine, 
as I practice my handwriting: I lay my alephs here, like ripe fruit, like a home away. ","When you said, “I’d cut my tongue,” I grew a callus over your mouth. Once, I tiptoed to catch a glimpse of you though I was not yours. If all was taken, who would you be?"
[The sun is lord of life and colour],"The sun is lord of life and colour,
Blood of the rose and hyacinth,
Hair of the sea and forests,
Crown of the cornfields,
Body of the hills.
The moon is the harlot of Death,
Slaughterer of the sun,
Priestess and poisoner she goes
With all her silver flock of wandering souls,
Her chant of wailing waters,
The bed of shimmering dust from which she comes
Bound all around with bandages of mist….
The living are as blossoms and fruit on the tree,
The dead are as lilies and wind on the marshes;
The living are as cherries that bow to the morning
Beckoning to the loitering stranger,
The wind, to sing them his eerie ballads.
The dead are as frozen skeleton branches
Whereon the stillness perches like an owl….
The dead are as snow on the cherry orchard.","The sun is lord of life and colour. The dead are as snow on the cherry orchard. The moon is the harlot of Death, slaughterer of the sun."
A Peasant's Song,"O, thou, who loved me once,
From thy Pagoda glance ;
Shoot down a poisoned lance :
        All’s well that comes from thee.
Look back, look down once more ;
Dear was to thee this shore ;
I see thee nevermore
        Beneath the olive tree.
Remains my station low,
Whilst thou dost greater grow ;
Ah, fate hath struck the blow
        That parted thee and me.
How can I bear my fate,
How can I loveless wait
In this most sorry state,
        When thou art far and free?
Far from the soul that swore
On love’s abysmal door
To cling forevermore
        To none on earth but thee ;
Free from the sacred plight
Which, to dispel the night,
Thou madest, when I quite
        Fell near thy bended knee.
Dost thou not still remember
Love’s May and Love’s December?
Both burned their sacred ember
        In our sweet company.
Dost hear the echoes fall
Within thy gilded hall?
Dost thou not ever recall
        The day thou wert like me?
When all thy gardens bloom,
Look out into the gloom ;
There does the flame consume
        Thy budless lilac tree.
There often thou didst play
A-mindless of the day
When soul to soul would say :
        “No more of thee and me.”
And when withers thy rose,
Throw to the wind that blows
This way a leaf ; who knows
        What therein I can see.
And till my course is run
I’ll count them one by one—
These leaves ; and may the sun
        Of joy ne’er set on thee.","The poem is called ‘O, thou, who loved me once,’ and was written in the first half of the 20th century. It was written by the poet and poet laureate of Greece, Giorgio Agnese."
Kennedy in Wexford,"There has always been a rumour that the local Bishop
Died the day before Kennedy came to Wexford
In June 1963. There was a feeling, rightly,
That the death would put a damper on the whole occasion.
People might mourn the Bishop or praise the President,
But they could hardly do both on the same day,
So the announcement of the death was postponed,
Until Kennedy had left. A good few must have known,
But they kept quiet on the matter. I have often wondered
If the very prospect of the visit did not, in fact, kill the Bishop.
Perhaps it affected his nervous system. Or froze his heart.
In any case, he lay there undead and unalive, virtual,
His episcopal soul in suspension, like Schrödinger’s cat,
Until Kennedy had waved at us all and departed.
Unlike Kennedy, the Bishop was a good-living, pious man.
He wrote a pamphlet on ‘The Christian Home’ and caused
No fuss until his untimely end. So, once the coast was clear,
You can be sure he went straight to heaven. Yet despite all this,
I believe that if people had been asked to choose between
A dead bishop and a live President, they would have opted for
The latter. I was only eight, but I too would have cheered
For Kennedy. I had been taken out of school and liked
Excitement. We stood on the quays and waited for his car
And went home with news of his suntan and his teeth.","There has always been a rumour that the local Bishop died the day before Kennedy came to Wexford in June 1963. I have often wondered if the very prospect of the visit did not, in fact, kill the Bishop."
Vinegar Hill,"The town reservoir on the hill
Was built in the forties.
If you lifted a round metal covering
And dropped a stone, you could
Hear it plonk into the depths.
There were small hollows in the rocks
That, no matter how dry the weather,
Were filled with rainwater.
These rock-pools must have been here
With different water in them
That summer when the rebels
Fled towards Needham’s Gap.
From the hill, as the croppies did,
You can view the town, narrow
Streets even narrower, and more
Trees and gardens than you imagined. 
It was burning then, of course,
But now, it is quiet. There is,
In the Market Square, a monument
To Father Murphy and the Croppy Boy.
We can see the hill from our house.
It is solid rock in the mornings
As the sun appears from just behind it.
It changes as the day does.
My mother is taking art classes
And, thinking it natural to make
The hill her focal point,
Is trying to paint it.
What colour is Vinegar Hill?
How does it rise above the town?
It is humped as much as round.
There is no point in invoking
History. The hill is above all that,
Intractable, unknowable, serene.
It is in shade, then in light,
And often caught between
When the blue becomes grey
And fades more, the green glistens,
And then not so much. The rock also
Glints in the afternoon light
That dwindles, making the glint disappear.
Then there is the small matter of clouds
That made tracks over the hill in a smoke
Of white as though instructed
By their superiors to break camp.
They change their shape, crouch down
Stay still, all camouflage, dreamy,
Lost, with no strategy to speak of,
Yet resigned to the inevitable:
When the wind comes for them, they will retreat.
Until this time, they are surrounded by sky
And can, as yet, envisage no way out.","We can see the hill from our house. The town reservoir on the hill                Was built in the forties. The hill is above all that,Intractable, unknowable, serene. It is in shade, then in light, and often caught between."
The God Of My Goddess,"The old gods and their slaves I’ve deserted ;
    The new gods I’ve shunned at first sight ;
And my god is the god of the goddess
    That presides at my feast of delight.
But once, when the dark moment lingered,
    I questioned the god she adores ;
To his throne I implored her to lead me,
    And, behold! I’m the god she implores.","""The old gods and their slaves I’ve deserted. The new gods I've shunned at first sight. And my god is the god of the goddess that presides at my feast"""
Independent Blossoms,"When the spring boughs were told
Soon the rose will unfold
    Herself in the bower
           Of which she is queen,
Their blossoms, beguiling
The sad leaves, said smiling :
    “No slaves to a flower
        Have we ever been.”
Our lords are the birds.
And they love not in words ;
    They sing when we smile
           And sob when we fall ;
Her lord is the liar—
The thief or the buyer—
    Who smells her the while
           She lives, and that’s all.","When the spring boughs were told                Soon the rose will unfold                     Herself in the bower.                 The sad leaves, said smiling: “No slaves to a flower”"
September,"The first September of the pandemic,
The sky’s a watercolour, white and grey,
And Pembroke Street is empty, and so is
Leeson Street. This is the time after time,
What the world will look like when the world
Is over, when people have been ushered into
Seats reserved for them in the luminous
Heavens.
                Moving towards the corner of
Upper Pembroke Street and Leeson Street,
An elderly man wears a mask; his walk is
Sprightly, his movements brisk. I catch
His watery eye for a watery moment. 
Without stopping, all matter-of-fact,
He says: ‘Someone told me you were dead.’","The first September of the pandemic, the sky’s a watercolour, white and grey. Pembroke Street is empty, and so is Leeson Street. An elderly man wears a mask; his walk is brisk. He says: ‘Someone told me you were dead.’"
The Fruits Of Death,"     I
Said golden leaves upon the ground 
    To new born leaves upon the tree : 
“Soon homeward autumn winds will blow 
    And carry us away to sea, 
Just as it shook the night before 
    The branches all and set us free ; 
No longer do we envy bird or dew, 
Nor do we want again to be like you.” 
    II
The sweet and tender leaves replied : 
    “Still we rejoice that we are here ; 
We rise from the eternal source 
    Of life to crown the dying year ; 
The wind that freed you we can see. 
    The sea you love we always hear. 
You are the booty of the storm and we,
We are the fruits of Death upon Life’s tree.”","“Soon homeward autumn winds will blow                     And carry us away to sea,” said the leaves. “No longer do we envy bird or dew,                 Nor do we want again to be like you.”"
Three Golden Threads (After de Lisle.),"Like yonder swallow, I would soar away,—
    Above the sea, far from this buzzing mart ;
But how can I?      A cruel, little fay
    Has fettered with three golden threads my heart.
Her honeyed tongue the one ; her eyes the other ;
    The third her lips ; and that completes her art.
No fruits from other gardens can I gather,
    For she has tied with golden threads my heart.
O, how I would asunder rend my chain,
    And from the tears and pangs of love depart ;
Ah, no!  ’tis better that I die in pain
    Than break the golden threads of my poor heart.","O, how I would asunder rend my chain, And from the tears and pangs of love depart ;Ah, no!  ’tis better that I die in pain than break the golden threads of my poor heart."
Rest,"Long have I a word enshrined 
And worshipped with a piety blind! 
Long have I been seeking Rest 
In the East and in the West! 
Here and there and everywhere 
Have I seen her shadow fair ; 
But the shadow seems to fade 
Like the flowers of yonder glade. 
In my lone retreat I sought 
Her, but dreams against me fought. 
In my nights for her I pray, 
But with sleep she stays away. 
Foolish is thine effort, vain— 
Fruitless, hopeless is thy pain! 
With the march of Motion keep, 
In thy walk and in thy sleep 
Beyond thy finite power it lies 
To chain the coursers of the skies. 
Even nomads and cells minute 
Worlds of unrest constitute. 
Rest is no where to be found ; 
Each to all in suffering bound. 
And no power can deliver thee, 
Mortal, from activity. 
In thy life as in thy death, 
In thy heart as in thy breath, 
On the earth as in the skies 
Restless Motion never dies. 
Always raging, always spinning, 
Endless and without beginning. 
Death, like me, is seeking Rest, 
And all the seas are in her quest ; 
But ah, poor souls, she is beyond 
Our grasp ; we must go on and on. 
No, nor even the grave is free 
From the laws that shackle me ; 
New life from his worms takes wing,
And on his face fresh blossoms spring.","Long have I been seeking Rest, long have I worshipped with a piety blind! Long have I sought Rest in the East and in the West! But the shadow seems to fade  like the flowers of yonder glade. Long has I sought her, but dreams against me fought."
The Tomb And The Rose (After Victor Hugo.),"The Tomb said to the Rose : 
O Flower of Love, where goes 
Each tear which Dawn upon thy cheeks doth 
          shed? 
The Rose said to the Tomb : 
What makest in thy gloom 
Impenetrable of the countless dead? 
Said the Rose : O Tomb, of all these tears, 
In my recesses ere the sun appears, 
I make a perfume which the gods will prize. 
Said the Tomb : O plaintive Flower, 
Of every mortal I devour 
An angel do I make for Paradise.","The Rose said to the Tomb : What makest in thy gloom                 Impenetrable of the countless dead? The Tomb replied: O Flower of Love, where goes each tear which Dawn upon thy cheeks doth?"
To The Sonnet,"Though cribbed and gyved, thou canst within thy 
          walls 
Unfold a wondrous wealth of worlds unseen,
And flood the soul’s abyss with moon-light sheen,
As well as darken passions’ gilded halls ; 
Thy fourteen outlets are so many falls 
From which gush out the prisoned joy, or 
         spleen— 
The silvery cascades, or the billows green,
And either a sea of bliss or grief recalls. 
Thou goddess of the gems of Fancy’s deep, 
Though few thy facets, they reflect the whole 
Of inner-self in multi-shaded hues ; 
Thou art the couch of dreams that never sleep ; 
Thou art the phoenix of the poet’s soul,
As well the crystal palace of his muse.","Within thy walls, unfold a wondrous wealth of worlds unseen, and flood the soul’s abyss with moon-light sheen, as well as darken passions’ gilded halls. Though cribbed and gyved, thy fourteen outlets are so many falls, from which gush out the prisoned joy."
Beneath The Salvias,"Beneath the salvias, where some angel slew 
The favors that were granted by his god, 
My heart is hidden ; let thy feet be shod 
With feathers plucked from my wings of crim- 
         son hue. 
When here again thou might’st be wandering 
         through ; 
Look not above; I’m breathing in the sod, 
A-mindless of the years, ’neath which I’m trod— 
Of Spring birds’ song, or shrieks of Winter’s 
         crew. 
Here let me sleep, my lady: wake me not ; 
Here let me gather, hidden from the moon 
And the sun, the strength to rise again and see ; 
No sweeter, dearer, more enchanting spot 
Is there for my sick heart ; O, not so soon— 
Awake me not—O, let me dream of thee.",The poem was written in the first half of the 20th century. It is set in a rural area of France. The story is about a man's struggle to find his way back home.
Stolen Salvias,"O, bleeding blossoms, tell, were my heart there— 
               There in your bed, 
Would that sweet thief that stole you unaware 
               Have stolen it instead ? 
Come with me, scarlet salvias, to your home ; 
               We are not late ; 
Love in the moonlight there again will roam— 
               There let us wait. 
I still remember when one night she crowned 
               Me with the stars 
Plucked from your scarlet sky—she would 
          astound 
              The kings of Mars. 
She then would slay me—wash the face of night 
              With my bold blood— 
Ay, she would show that yours is not as bright 
              And not as good. 
O, scarlet salvias, why should I refuse 
              When I’m with you ? 
Why should I chill my lady, if she choose 
              To steal me too ?",The song is called ‘The King of Mars’ and was written by the same author. It is about a woman who steals a man’s heart and then slays him.
Jealousy,"The violets their soft, dark lashes part, 
    While robins serenade them far and near ; 
But the anemone, with ebon heart 
    And blood-shot eyes, pretends she does not 
          hear. 
The violets invite the nightingale 
    Whose carols fall in dew upon their bed ; 
But the hydrangea, as saffron pale, 
    Holds high above the wall her nodding head.",The violets invite the nightingale. The hydrangea holds high above the wall her nodding head. The anemone pretends she does not hear.
Saada,"Long hast thou suffered, sister of my heart, 
              Still thou art 
              Fair to see ; 
Thy pains thou entertainest with thy song, 
              But how long 
              Will this be? 
The seasons all have come and gone, my dear, 
              But thy cheer 
              Still abides. 
I ask which of thy moan or song is best 
              And thou sayst : 
              “God decides.” 
I feel the ebbing of the undertone 
              Of thy moan 
              In thy song ; 
How long will tears and irony compete 
              For thee, Sweet, 
              O, how long? 
When wilt thou, Baby dear, with nimble feet, 
              Run to greet 
              Me at the door? 
When wilt thou, Saada, walk again with me 
              Near the sea, 
              As before? 
O sister, how I wish to see thee run, 
              In the sun, 
              On the sands ! 
The singing breakers and the smiling beach 
              To thee reach 
              Out their hands. 
The light of day is longing for thy face 
              And the grace 
              Of thy form ; 
O how I wish to see thee, Noor-ul-Ain 
              Caught again 
              In the storm !","Long hast thou suffered, sister of my heart, says the poet. But how long will this be? he asks. ""I feel the ebbing of the undertone of thy moan,"" he writes."

A Nocturn,"Upon the face of darkness beams my soul— 
    Nearby, behind the curtains of my sight; 
And ’round it weary waves of wonder roll— 
    Sad seas of color o’er dead seas of light: 
    Here is no Space, no Time—nor day nor night— 
Here is the boundless, undiminished Whole— 
                 Here is my soul.
Here is no love that hides beneath its shoal 
    The sandix that can redden a sea of years; 
Here is no lust that lies to Beauty’s mole 
    And draws from eyes of flint a flood of tears; 
    Here is no disenchantment and no fears— 
No blasted hopes, no jaunty joy, no dole— 
                 Here is my soul. 
Now lost in clay and water; now the Whole 
    Is lost within me: sea and earth and sky 
I dismiss from my presence, as I roll 
    My lids and lo, the lord of night am I. 
    Into the airless wilderness I fly; 
Here is no vain desire, no galling goal— 
                Here is my soul. 
In Eternity, shod with the hoary noul 
    Of deathless Death—in dim and shimmering shades 
Of soilless vales that bosom and cajole 
    The crystal flowers dropping from cloud-cascades; 
    Here in the grove of myriad colonnades 
Of jet and pearl and amber I now stroll— 
                Here is my soul.","The poem is titled ‘The Lord of night’ and is written in the form of a short story. It is set in a world where there is ‘no Space, no Time, nor day nor night'"

Her First Sorrow,"’T is but a score of hours when he didst swear
My sorrow and my joy to share.
    Despite the fates, fore’er ;
But now he’s gone to cash again his lie ;
    Others his shame with me will wear,
                  Why should I die?
Last night his lips my very feet didst burn ;
His kisses dropt, my love to earn,
    Whichever way he’d turn ;
But now he’s gone another soul to rob,
    Another heart to lure and spurn,
                   Why should I sob?
He did not kiss me when he said good-bye ;
I let him go, not asking why,
    Nor do I for him sigh ;
He’s gone another virgin breast to tear.
    He’s gone on other lips to die,
                    Why should I care?","""Why should I die? Why should I sob?"" asks the poet. ""He’s gone another virgin breast to tear. He did not kiss me when he said good-bye"""
The Brass Bed,"I love thy color and thy symmetry ;
I love the art that wrought thy glittering arms.
Thy canopy, thy satin portieres too ;
I love the silks and feathers on thy breast—
The cushions and the pillows and the quilts :
I love thine every part.
Yet still more do I love to rest in thee—
To dream of art’s perfection in thy frame ;
Of paths as smooth, as shining as thy limbs ;
Of scenes as exquisite as thy coils ;
Of nooks as warm as thine hospitable bosom,
As cool and as refreshing as thy veinless naked arms,
I dream of all beneath thy soothing mantle.
But O, I love my dreams much more than thee,
And one sad soul much more than all my dreams.
If thou hadst but an eye to see,
To look upon the guest that lay upon thy floor
Beneath thy silken ceiling !
O, hadst thou but an ear to hear
The plaintive chirpings of this swallow-soul.
Couldst thou but feel her forehead
Moistened with the sweat of hope and pain.
For forty moons she lay within thine arms,
Rubbing her erstwhile rosy cheeks
Against the ulcers of Ayoub of yore.
Couldst thou but see, O Bed of Brass,
Couldst thou but hear, couldst thou but feel,—
Of what use all thy showy stuff—
Thy glittering brass, the filigree of art,
Thy floor of down and feather cushions all,
Thy snow-white mantles, satin tapestries?
Beauty and Pain!
Death will not come with thee, O Pain!
Life will not come with thee, O Beauty!
The fires of hell are but a taper’s flame compared to this.
Thy guest, O Bed of Brass,
Looks on thee with a yearning glance,
And vet her soul, bearing the torch of Pain,
Is searching all the worlds for Death.","I love my dreams much more than thee, and one sad soul more than all my dreams. I love the art that wrought thy glittering arms, and the silks and feathers on thy breast. Yet still more do I love to rest in thee, to dream of art’s perfection in thy frame."
The Moonlight,"I waited on
In the late autumn moonlight,
A train droning out of thought—
The mind on moonlight
And on trains.
Blind as a thread of water
Stirring through a cold like dust,
Lonely beyond all silence
And humming this to children,
The nostalgic listeners in sleep,
Because no guardian
Strides through distance upon distance,
His eyes a web of sleep.","I waited on a train in the late autumn moonlight, a train droning out of thought. The mind on moonlight is blind as a thread of water, stirring through a cold like dust."
The City,"after C. P. Cavafy
You tell me: I’m going to another country,
another city, another body.
Perhaps my heart will stay uncertain,
and I will destroy my history but I am leaving.
Even if on every street, I find the ruins of our bodies,
I’ll roam like a restless soul anyway.
I tell you: you won’t find a new country,
new city, new body. You’ll return to roam
the same ruins, same streets, same quartiere,
return to complain in the same room
of the same house, return to the memory of our intertwined bodies.
You will always end up in Roma: I will always remain in you.
And maybe late, you’ll see, that what you destroyed
is worth more than all the worlds you wasted your time in.",C. P. Cavafy wrote the poem for the book Roma: A Biography of an Autobiography. The book is published by Verso and is available in hardback and paperback.
Mr. Chairman Takes His Leave,"As to me, I know of nothing else but miracles.
—Walt Whitman 
 en memoria William Rashall Sinkin, 1913–2014 
Whitman, you once told me, is democracy on the page, messy 
and imperfect as we are in real life, which gave you hope 
that we would one day make real life true democracy, ripe blossom,
pollen dusting every moment and person, each scampering mote of light. 
This is why as you lay dying, I read “I Hear America Singing”
and knew you heard every word and could feel my hand on yours 
though you were already moving toward other miracles than this life.
A sunflower followed your motion and a yellow dog stood guard. 
You, who lived the notion that the sun belongs to each and every one,
beggars, dreamers, kings, all. You who believed banks could have hearts, 
for god’s sake! You have left it to us, messy and imperfect
as we are and will be, to keep to the work side by side 
and as long as it takes, all the while singing of miracles
just as Whitman and you taught us to do. Meanwhile, you 
were last seen wearing blue-plaid pajamas, a contrasting
blue-plaid bow tie, and surrounded by hummingbirds. 
Hummingbirds leave Texas in early February, migrating north
to make new lives. The angle of the sun tells them precisely when 
to take their leave. They arrive thousands of miles away
in mid-May, about the time of your birthday. A sunflower 
follows your motion. The yellow dog stands guard.","Whitman, you once told me, is democracy on the page, messy and imperfect as we are in real life. A sunflower followed your motion and a yellow dog stood guard. As to me, I know of nothing else but miracles."
Imagining My Neighbor,"Now that night has fallen like a broken cart,
he cups his ear against the old red radio,  
attempting to tune out the stream
of unintelligible street verbiage  
leaking thru the window.  
Earlier, he opened all the blinds,
but left the front door closed.
Why do we seal off those places
flooding the greater light?
I imagine in the quiet cottage of his brain
the sepia of this desert city,
wind, dirt, grit that scuffs your skin.
Wish him gentleness in the shade of shadows.
We spoke once. “This heat. Too much,” he tells me.
His birth city is a place where the Pacific baptizes
each morning with softness, the smell of seaweed.
Each day predictable as a calendar.
Today he is a leopard lizard
stalking his oppressor for that which is too much.
I shut blinds. Retreat from voyeurism.  
I have no heat or words to offer him.
I am a wheel that does not move the cart.","The author is in a desert city in the middle of a heat wave. The heat is too much for him, he tells the author. The author shuts the blinds and retreats from voyeurism."
My Love Must Be As Free,"My love must be as free 
    As is the eagle's wing, 
Hovering o'er land and sea 
    And everything 
I must not dim my eye 
    In thy saloon, 
I must not leave my sky 
    And nightly moon 
Be not the fowler's net 
    Which stays my flight, 
And craftily is set 
    T' allure the sight
But be the favoring gale 
    That bears me on, 
And still doth fill my sail 
    When thou art gone 
I cannot leave my sky 
    For thy caprice, 
True love would soar as high 
    As heaven is 
The eagle would not brook 
    Her mate thus won, 
Who trained his eye to look 
    Beneath the sun","My love must be as free                     As is the eagle's wing,                 Hovering o'er land and sea. I must not dim my eye                  In thy saloon. I cannot leave my sky."
Guitarrero!,"Cyrus, always I try to put my soul
into building a guitar,
here on Cuesta de Gomerez,
full of sovereign guitar-makers,
street slanting up to an arch
of the colossal Alhambra.
What I worship is the feeling of the wood
in my hardworking hands,
wood selected and dried
for a three-decade minimum,
so I’m refining Mediterranean
or Canadian cypress,
Macassar ebony, and Lebanese cedar
that my paternal grandfather chose,
Abuelo Leonel who perished
the Satan-hot August
right before I was born
into a dynasty of on-fire
flamenco musicians and dancers.
Imagine, a top notch guitar
means perhaps a hundred hours
of dedicated labor, and, so help me,
I don’t work by the clock—
Sometimes it costs me
most of a day to adjust
the nitty-gritty strings and frets,
to insure the vigorous, brave sound
we’re famous for in Granada:
due to the vega’s dry air,
instruments from the Andalusian school
are (no doubt about it!) lighter,
distinctive—like a palace starling
or a peerless voice
that gently breathes and sings
in a stone basilica on Sunday morning—
acoustic splendor and tone to rival
the able makers in Madrid—
At the fabled Moorish citadel’s hem,
I bring my busy-as-hell hands
to the timeless task of planing
and judge the thickness
of my newly launched guitars
with my tried-and-true fingers.
The tradition, I tell you, is to present
your very first guitar as a gift
to the regal, lullaby-whispering woman
who latched you to this bustling,
wondrous world:
Oh what an exhilarating day
when my never-fail mother, Primavera,
carefully inspected my first ever piece,
proclaiming (almost singing it!):
Guitarrero!","Cyrus is a guitarist from Granada, Spain. His father was a member of a dynasty of on-fire Flamenco musicians and dancers. Cyrus: ""I try to put my soul into building a guitar"""

From Brooklyn,"Along the shore

Tangles the pulpy yellow lamps.

Across the river Manhattan floats—
Dim gardens of fire—
And rushing invisible toward me through the fog,
A hurricane of faces.","Across the river Manhattan floats, rushing invisible toward me through the fog, a hurricane of faces. Along the shore a black net of branches                Tangles the pulpy yellow lamps."
"Dong, Sounds The Brass In The East","Dong, sounds the brass in the east,
As if to a funeral feast,
But I like that sound the best
Out of the fluttering west

But the fairies' silvery bell
Is the voice of that gentle folk,
Or else the horizon that spoke
Its metal is not of brass,
But air, and water, and glass,
And under a cloud it is swung,
And by the wind it is rung,
When the steeple tolleth the noon
It soundeth not so soon,
Yet it rings a far earlier hour,
And the sun has not reached its tower","Dong, sounds the brass in the east,                As if to a funeral feast,                But I like that sound the best.

Dirge,"Place this bunch of mignonette
    In her cold, dead hand;
When the golden sun is set,
    Where the poplars stand,
Bury her from sun and day,
Lay my little love away
    From my sight.
She was like a modest flower
    Blown in sunny June,
Warm as sun at noon's high hour,
    Chaster than the moon.
Ah, her day was brief and bright,
Earth has lost a star of light;
    She is dead.
Softly breathe her name to me,—
    Ah, I loved her so.
Gentle let your tribute be;
None may better know
    Her true worth than I who weep
O'er her as she lies asleep—
    Soft asleep.
Lay these lilies on her breast,
    They are not more white
Than the soul of her, at rest
    'Neath their petals bright.
Chant your aves soft and low,
Solemn be your tread and slow,—
    She is dead.
Lay her here beneath the grass,
    Cool and green and sweet,
Where the gentle brook may pass
    Crooning at her feet.
Nature's bards shall come and sing,
And the fairest flowers shall spring
    Where she lies.
Safe above the water's swirl,
    She has crossed the bar;
Earth has lost a precious pearl,
    Heaven has gained a star,
That shall ever sing and shine,
Till it quells this grief of mine
    For my love.","She was like a modest flower. Blown in sunny June, warm as sun at noon's high hour. Place this bunch of mignonette in her cold, dead hand. When the golden sun is set bury her from sun and day."
A Drowsy Day,"The air is dark, the sky is gray,
    The misty shadows come and go,
And here within my dusky room
Each chair looks ghostly in the gloom.
    Outside the rain falls cold and slow—
Half-stinging drops, half-blinding spray.
Each slightest sound is magnified,
    For drowsy quiet holds her reign;
The burnt stick in the fireplace breaks,
The nodding cat with start awakes,
    And then to sleep drops off again,
Unheeding Towser at her side.
I look far out across the lawn,
    Where huddled stand the silly sheep;
My work lies idle at my hands,
My thoughts fly out like scattered strands
    Of thread, and on the verge of sleep—
Still half awake—I dream and yawn.
What spirits rise before my eyes!
    How various of kind and form!
Sweet memories of days long past,
The dreams of youth that could not last,
    Each smiling calm, each raging storm,
That swept across my early skies.
Half seen, the bare, gaunt-fingered boughs
    Before my window sweep and sway,
And chafe in tortures of unrest.
My chin sinks down upon my breast;
    I cannot work on such a day,
But only sit and dream and drowse.","The author writes about a day in which the air is dark, the sky is gray, and the slightest sound is magnified. The author's thoughts fly out like scattered strands of thread, and on the verge of sleep, he dream and yawn."

Bent down and kissed the sleeping Night.

And bears thee up above the clouds,
Over desponding human crowds,

Sunday,"So this is Sunday evening

the yellow bells sound yellow alarms 
from tall stalks, and the sunflowers peep
over the fence into the street

and walkers and joggers and dogs and strollers
pass. Our weeping
persimmon makes a small room
under its branches that children
younger than mine could inhabit 
for an afternoon. Squirrels chase 
each other up the live oak trunk, scratching
the bark. Crape myrtle, peach, plum:
our tiny arboretum. 
We had another tree that had room  
for two girls to sit in it, but the winter freeze
killed it. Gone, too,

wearing only a long t-shirt and underwear
with her ageless legs for all to see,

as I wait now, for my daughters’ tears
to come the way they do every Sunday evening
because we cut down their climbing tree
and tomorrow is a school day, and they don’t care
about the sky dropping pink and orange curtains
around the neighbor’s house, ending an opera
about a house that held a woman’s life
that some tomorrow will scrape down. ",This is Sunday evening                 under the live oak behind the kitchen. The Rose of Sharon                 spills purple tea onto the grass. Squirrels chase each other up the trunk.

"Time,","for Aya, September 2021
Be kind to her. She’s eleven & already
wants to turn you back. She wished this
after she squeezed a drop from her index
& read me the number. She always insists
I close my eyes & guess
what her blood is saying—
sometimes I’m wrong & sometimes not.
I kiss the tiny tears on her fingertips.
I kiss her arms & thighs before the insulin.
When I ask her to inject herself, I’m asking her to live
without me, & she knows it. When her legs trembled,
& I soothed with “I’m here, I’m here,”
she reminded me: “But you can’t do anything.”
Perhaps she meant “undo.”
Who am I kidding. Time, I demanded your undoing too,
that first night in the hospital before dawn,
when I woke up having forgotten, then remembered
where I was, what had happened.
The neon corridor light, the nurses’ chatter,
the potassium’s slow burn in my daughter’s vein.
Time, I know
I can’t reason with you. You go on and on.
Instead, I’m wishing her
astonishing slowness, softness
inside the arduous & unfair. Like this:
the dog’s limp, the cold coffee, the struggling
baby bougainvillea, the winged ant on the floor,
the half-eaten sandwich, the tenderness
of the 5am light, the daily departures,
the basil plant’s shadow on the wall,
& her hair, the swing of my love’s hair
as she runs, shaking her head
left & right, left & right,
how she always ran like this, always ran
as if swaying, No, No.",Aya is 11 years old and has been diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes. Her mother says she wants to turn her back on the disease.
Mercy,"If you could ask the stars,
Those flickers that visit nightly,
They would tell you it wasn’t them
Who carved us from mud
To marvel at our opposable thumbs.
It wasn’t them who forfeited God
For a watch that didn’t work anyway.
It wasn’t them who sometimes denied
Us the living mirror we named love.
And still you look to them
For stories, for riddles, for answers
That they never possessed.
I’m not saying I’m better than you,
Far from it, if you find me here
Erecting the same elements
With these meager tools,
Wanting even now to give them life,
That they may look upon me with mercy.
I’ve been a prophet. I’ve been a fool.","I’ve been a prophet. I’'ve been a fool. If you could ask the stars, they would tell you it wasn’t them who carved us from mud. I want to give them life, that they may look upon me with mercy."
V. Wukuada,"for Freddie Carlos Kweku “Pepper” Gray
 Wukuada 1989–Kwasiada 2015
Raheem tells the story best,
of how Freddie got his nickname.
              It was after football practice
              in the Pop Warner
peewee league. Freddie was the same
even back then, small as hell, quick too.
              Even quicker
              with his tongue.
During the last play of the scrimmage,
Freddie broke a 30-yard run, wiggled
              through 3 tackles, and used
              his signature spin-move
to sneak into the end-zone
for the score. He couldn’t stop
             jawing at all the players he’d juked.
             Especially, Chaz who froze
when Freddie put the spin on him.
Yo, Chaz, your uniform lookin’ extra wrinkled today.
             When you get home be sure to ask yo mama
             to put it through the spin-cycle. “Pepper.”
Cortez tells the story best of how Freddie
kept his nickname, “Pepper.” The dogdays of 2014
             had hit West Baltimore hard, fleecing
             the air with gummy gusts
from the Chesapeake. You could feel the brackish
mist tattooing your skin. Freddie had just
             finished working on his van, nursing
             the engine fan and coolant fluids.
He then heard the pied soundtrack of Mister Softee
     ‘round the corner, off of Lorraine and Greenmount.
         Just like that, kids gushed from Gilmor porches
                gunning to best their friends in line.
Freddie had had a good week. His van repairs, minimal. He
       politely waded through the brimming line. Smiling at the
incredulous looks from kids ready to condemn his breach of
                                         no-cutting-in-the-ice-cream-line decorum.
He smiled. Pulling a slim wad from his left pant-pocket. He
looked back to the eager patrons behind him and winked. He
whispered to the kid closest to him, what’s your favorite flavor?
         Satisfied with the response of Banana Twist,
he countered, Aight, I’ll grab it for ya, first tell me a joke.
Then the next kid, and the next, and just like that
         he purchased ice cream
         for the whole block: “Pepper.”","Freddie Carlos Kweku “Pepper” Gray was killed in a car crash in Baltimore. He was known as ‘Pepper,’ a nickname given to him by his friends and family."

only: let me grow old enough

the latest Airbus A350

a deep navy coat and slacks,
overlain with bulbous gold buttons.
Three gold stripes on each shoulder
Three gold stripes on each sleeve.
His silver aviation wings are pinned
squarely; just left of a slim lapel,
above the crease of his breast-pocket,
along with a Jacksonville Jaguars pin,
because this year will finally be the year.
He nods to the head flight attendant
and gives his co-pilot a close-tuck dap,
before beginning the aircraft’s careen
along the runway.
The tenor and water of his south-Florida drawl
meld with the plane’s PA system like morninglight
mingled with dew: Ladies and gentlemen

he measures the water
in each cloud.

nesting cloud-water.

The Dark Night (XVIII),"Our love is woven
Of a thousand strands—
The cool fragrance of the first lilac
At morning,
The first dew on the grass,
The smell of wild mint in the wood,
The pungent and earthy smell of ground ivy crushed under our feet;
Songs of birds, songs of great poets;
The leaping of the red squirrel in the tree,
The running of the river,
The commotion of stars and clouds in the high winds at night;
And dark stillness.
It is adorned with all the flowers
That stand in our garden;
It holds the night and the day.
Our love is made
Of the South Wind and the West Wind,
And the soft falling of rain;
Of white April evenings;
It is made of trees,
And of the many-coloured fields on the hills;
Of horizons,
Dark sea-blue of the west, thin sky-blue of the east,
With a yellow road between.
The flames of sunset and sunrise

October,"October is the treasurer of the year,
    And all the months pay bounty to her store;
The fields and orchards still their tribute bear,
    And fill her brimming coffers more and more
But she, with youthful lavishness,
    Spends all her wealth in gaudy dress,
And decks herself in garments bold
    Of scarlet, purple, red, and gold.
She heedeth not how swift the hours fly,
    But smiles and sings her happy life along;
She only sees above a shining sky;
    She only hears the breezes’ voice in song.
Her garments trail the woodlands through,
    And gather pearls of early dew
That sparkle, till the roguish Sun
    Creeps up and steals them every one.
But what cares she that jewels should be lost,
    When all of Nature’s bounteous wealth is hers?
Though princely fortunes may have been their cost,
    Not one regret her calm demeanor stirs.

Nor cares when Frost stalks o’er her way

Good-Night,"The lark is silent in his nest,
    The breeze is sighing in its flight,
Sleep, Love, and peaceful be thy rest.
    Good-night, my love, good-night, good-night.
Sweet dreams attend thee in thy sleep,
    To soothe thy rest till morning's light,
And angels round thee vigil keep.

Sleep well, my love, on night's dark breast,
    And ease thy soul with slumber bright;
Be joy but thine and I am blest.

He Had His Dream,"He had his dream, and all through life,
Worked up to it through toil and strife.
Afloat fore'er before his eyes,
It colored for him all his skies:
    The storm-cloud dark
    Above his bark,
The calm and listless vault of blue
Took on its hopeful hue,
It tinctured every passing beam—
    He had his dream.
He labored hard and failed at last,
His sails too weak to bear the blast,
The raging tempests tore away
And sent his beating bark astray.
    But what cared he
    For wind or sea!
He said, ""The tempest will be short,
My bark will come to port.""
He saw through every cloud a gleam—
    He had his dream.","He had his dream, and all through life, worked up to it through toil and strife. He labored hard and failed at last, his sails too weak to bear the blast. The raging tempests tore away his beating bark astray."
Disappointed,"An old man planted and dug and tended,
    Toiling in joy from dew to dew;
The sun was kind, and the rain befriended;
    Fine grew his orchard and fair to view.
Then he said: 'I will quiet my thrifty fears,
For here is fruit for my failing years.'
But even then the storm-clouds gathered,
    Swallowing up the azure sky;
The sweeping winds into white foam lathered
    The placid breast of the bay, hard by;
Then the spirits that raged in the darkened air
Swept o'er his orchard and left it bare.
The old man stood in the rain, uncaring,
    Viewing the place the storm had swept;
And then with a cry from his soul despairing,
    He bowed him down to the earth and wept.
But a voice cried aloud from the driving rain;
""Arise, old man, and plant again!""","An old man planted and dug and tended his orchard. He said: 'I will quiet my thrifty fears,For here is fruit for my failing years' But even then the storm-clouds gathered. He bowed down to the earth and wept."
A Corn-Song,"On the wide veranda white,
    In the purple failing light,
Sits the master while the sun is lowly burning;
And his dreamy thoughts are drowned
In the softly flowing sound
Of the corn-songs of the field-hands slow returning.
        Oh, we ho de co'n
        Since de ehly mo'n;
        Now de sinkin' sun
        Says de day is done.
O'er the fields with heavy tread,
Light of heart and high of head,
Though the halting steps be labored, slow, and weary;
Still the spirits brave and strong
Find a comforter in song,
And their corn-song rises ever loud and cheery.
        Oh, we ho de co'n
        Since de ehly mo'n;
        Now de sinkin' sun
        Says de day is done.
To the master in his seat,
    Comes the burden, full and sweet,
Of the mellow minor music growing clearer,
As the toilers raise the hymn,
Thro' the silence dusk and dim,
To the cabin's restful shelter drawing nearer.
        Oh, we ho de co'n
        Since de ehly mo'n;
        Now de sinkin' sun
        Says de day is done.
And a tear is in the eye
Of the master sitting by,
As he listens to the echoes low-replying
To the music's fading calls
As it faints away and falls
Into silence, deep within the cabin dying.
        Oh, we ho de co'n
        Since de ehly mo'n;
        Now de sinkin' sun

First they tango on my tongue,
nimble couples careening,

West Indies allspice dazzles,
berries tangling with cinnamon sticks,
while cloves, Indonesian natives,

Coriander seeds offer greetings in Hindi
as others toast comrades in languages
beyond borders and blockades.
Lifting up sisterhood, sun-wizened nutmeg
starts a sibling dance with mace.
Cumin demurs, then surprises
with subtle exultation.

host of the party, gives a nod to flavors
in hiding: lemony, sweet, warm,

Gifts,"I kept my life in a small room

On Time,"His head’s a secret train-set in the attic:
quiet, straightforward, always summer.

forever waving their stiff handkerchiefs
at the trains that are always on time.","His head’s a secret train-set in the attic: quiet, straightforward, always summer. The cattle in their fields of baize, the postman on his bike, the green sponge trees by the papier-mâché tunnel."
from “The Land”,"That was a spring of storms. They prowled the night;
Low level lightning flickered in the east
Continuous. The white pear-blossom gleamed
Motionless in the flashes; birds were still;
Darkness and silence knotted to suspense,
Riven by the premonitory glint
Of skulking storm, a giant that whirled a sword
Over the low horizon, and with tread
Earth-shaking ever threatened his approach,
But to delay his terror kept afar,
And held earth stayed in waiting like a beast
Bowed to receive a blow. But when he strode
Down from his throne of hills upon the plain,
And broke his anger to a thousand shards
Over the prostrate fields, then leapt the earth
Proud to accept his challenge; drank his rain;
Under his sudden wind tossed wild her trees;
Opened her secret bosom to his shafts;
The great drops spattered; then above the house
Crashed thunder, and the little wainscot shook
And the green garden in the lightning lay.",A spring of storms. They prowled the night; low level lightning flickered in the east. The white pear-blossom gleamedMotionless in the flashes; birds were still.

Divorce Song,"A man who is probably my husband sails by. 
But I just see a sailboat, not who steers it. 
But I picture a man, in the gender of things. 
My husband who you will not meet.
He’s off, I don’t know, marshalling.
Ideas, not soldiers. Sailing helps him think. 
I used to join him. Then we argued.
For a decade we argued. And sometimes 
sailed, though I was admittedly mostly 
decorative, a mermaid on the prow. 
Whether I brought him better luck 
is not my weather to tell. I cost him. 
Time. He costs me. More.","A man who is probably my husband sails by. But I just see a sailboat, not who steers it. I picture a man, in the gender of things."
Ballad,"I Know my love is true,
    And oh the day is fair.
The sky is dear and blue,
The flowers are rich of hue,
    The air I breathe is rare,
    I have no grief or care;
For my own love is true,
    And oh the day is fair.
My love is false I find,
    And oh the day is dark.
Blows sadly down the wind,
While sorrow holds my mind;
    I do not hear the lark,
    For quenched is life's dear spark,—
My love is false I find,
    And oh the day is dark!
For love doth make the day
    Or dark or doubly bright;
Her beams along the way
Dispel the gloom and gray.
    She lives and all is bright,
    She dies and life is night.
For love doth make the day,
    Or dark or doubly bright. ","I Know my love is true,                    And oh the day is fair. I have no grief or care. For love doth make the day,   Or dark or doubly bright."
The Pact,"All those years—paw of again, paw of let’s go, 
of lake-plash, of come throw, perked ear

distinguished scholar of curbside, delighted
roller in the perfume of foul, sleek 
fetcher, sock chewer, under table sleeper,
taut leaper into air & pond—then, all at once,
it became her turn & the reliable 
body began—the unimaginable undoing; 
while we—scratchers of belly & ear, callers of hey, 
come back, diligent trainers of down & come,
companions of dawn, partners of rain,
& errand, stick throwers, ball wranglers, 
chair readers & nappers,
while at our feet with twitch & yelp,
she rustles through the high grass of dream—
understood it was now our turn, 
which meant—as it does with each animal sorrow
—doing the unimaginable.","All those years—paw of again, paw of let’s go, of lake-plash, of come throw, perked ear                of what’�s that? of yanked back who's that? then, all at once, it became her turn & the reliable                 body began—the unimaginable undoing."
Farnaz,"1. 
Our parents argued in a language 
we didn’t understand. We were born 
in Las Vegas or Teheran, 
twin cities of fantasy and chance. My 
sister and I found our words in Long 
Beach, Big Wheels and Barbies, 
Bluebird troops and kidnap breakfasts. 
A war forced our cousins 
to buy false passports, lose their savings. 
We ate Chef Boyardee after school, 
hot spinach and meatball soup 
on the weekends. I yelled into a phone 
so my Iranian family could hear 
me. I learned I was the silk carpet 
my mother didn’t own, the casino 
payout my father kept chasing. 
I didn’t know until later 
the Persian Leopard was trapped 
in the Zagros mountains after 
the Iran-Iraq war, in danger 
of tripping old mines. 
2. 
I taught myself who I was 
by watching my sister carefully.  
I worried when  
the day came and I wanted 
to say I’m not her. First out the womb,  
she was named and I wasn’t.  
Her name is Iranian but sayable  
by everyone. My name 
would wait. They waited until 
they knew they had it right. 
Not Sheila, my mother’s veto. 
Farnaz, a name that made me lonely.  
We lived in between Iran 
and America, a customs declaration zone.
By the time I was born 
my mute parents wondered 
how to speak as Americans 
as they moved away 
from the people who loved them. 
How could I know the dark 
inside their mouths hurt them, too. 
3. 
My father studied numbers in the racing 
forms, and I bet following my gut. 
I influenced dice at the craps table 
by spinning three times  
in each direction while my father  
placed his bets. Even now, 
I’ll retell stories in my head 
one hundred times to end them right.  
It’s a system.  
I came from the racetrack, ignoring  
all the horses in the flesh. I sounded out  
the names of long shots.  
The odds say Blinding Telegram 
will win, but I like the music 
of Queen the Fox. 
I believed that how I got my name would mean 
something. I am still finding the names for some things: 
the youth my parents brought to parenting, the attention 
I didn’t know I was waiting for, the word for wanting, 
feeling its deep hole. Such naming 
I have been slow to do. I am waiting until I have it right. 
I know that once named there is a road 
down which that named thing runs, 
and I am not the one who built the road. ","The author was born in Las Vegas and raised in Teheran, Iran. He writes about how he learned who he was and how his name came to be."
The Wooing,"A Youth went faring up and down,
    Alack and well-a-day.
He fared him to the market town,
    Alack and well-a-day.
And there he met a maiden fair,
With hazel eyes and auburn hair;
His heart went from him then and there,
    Alack and well-a-day.
She posies sold right merrily,
    Alack and well-a-day;
But not a flower was fair as she,
    Alack and well-a-day.
He bought a rose and sighed a sigh,
“Ah, dearest maiden, would that I
Might dare the seller too to buy!”
    Alack and well-a-day.
She tossed her head, the coy coquette,
    Alack and well-a-day.
“I'm not, sir, in the market yet,”
    Alack and well-a-day.
“Your love must cool upon a shelf;
Tho' much I sell for gold and pelf,
I'm yet too young to sell myself,”
    Alack and well-a-day.
The youth was filled with sorrow sore,
    Alack and well-a-day;
And looked he at the maid once more,
    Alack and well-a-day.
Then loud he cried, “Fair maiden, if
Too young to sell, now as I live,
You're not too young yourself to give,”
    Alack and well-a-day.
The little maid cast down her eyes,
    Alack and well-a-day,
And many a flush began to rise,
    Alack and well-a-day.
“Why, since you are so bold,' she said,
“I doubt not you are highly bred,
So take me!"" and the twain were wed,
    Alack and well-a-day.","A youth went to the market town, and there he met a maiden fair, with hazel eyes and auburn hair. He bought a rose and sighed a sigh, saying, “Ah, dearest maiden, would that I might dare the seller too to buy!”"
Melancholia,"Silently without my window,
    Tapping gently at the pane,
    Falls the rain.
Through the trees sighs the breeze
    Like a soul in pain.
Here alone I sit and weep;
Thought hath banished sleep.
Wearily I sit and listen
    To the water's ceaseless drip.
    To my lip
Fate turns up the bitter cup,
    Forcing me to sip;
'Tis a bitter, bitter drink,
Thus I sit and think,—
Thinking things unknown and awful,
    Thoughts on wild, uncanny themes,
    Waking dreams.
Spectres dark, corpses stark,
    Show the gaping seams
Whence the cold and cruel knife
Stole away their life.
Bloodshot eyes all strained and staring,
    Gazing ghastly into mine;
    Blood like wine
On the brow—clotted now—
    Shows death's dreadful sign.
Lonely vigil still I keep;
Would that I might sleep!
Still, oh, still, my brain is whirling!
    Still runs on my stream of thought;
    I am caught
In the net fate hath set.
    Mind and soul are brought
To destruction's very brink;
Yet I can but think!
Eyes that look into the future, —
    Peeping forth from out my mind,
    They will find
Some new weight, soon or late,
On my soul to bind,
Crushing all its courage out,—
Heavier than doubt.
Dawn, the Eastern monarch's daughter,
    Rising from her dewy bed,

Come, O gentle Sleep!
Hark! the morning cock is crowing;
    Dreams, like ghosts, must hie away;
    'Tis the day.
Rosy morn now is born;
    Dark thoughts may not stay.
Day my brain from foes will keep;
Now, my soul, I sleep.","""Here alone I sit and weep;Thought hath banished sleep. Silently without my window, I listen to the water's ceaseless drip. I am caught in the net fate hath set. Mind and soul are brought to destruction's very brink; yet I can but think!"""
My Local Dead,"This was the time of year we would go into the frozen forest—
leaves stripped, only a few birds ticking in the bare trees, fields shorn,
corn trash a dull gold. Sometimes snow would fall, and I can recall
the exact sound of its muffling, quieting whiteness crackling down. 
Of our hunting party, only two of us are alive—
grandparents long dead, father and nephew dead, their bones
all on the ridge top with the others. The town is shabbier now,
middle classes disappeared, leaving the ancient, the angry and the slow.
My cousin is returning home—to a place he reviled—
having run out his luck in the West. His plan 
is to move into the garage on the old homestead, which of course
is no plan at all. I sometimes hear the call to return,
come back to the shady valley with its reliable breeze, 
the crumbling brindle bluffs, a brandy old fashioned made with 7UP
waiting for me on the sticky bar of the Golden Frog, 
recognition registering with those I meet when they see
my father looking back from inside my aging face. That place
don’t fade—the one that made me—bone isotopes belie 
the soil’s iron and chalk, my talk inflected (sorry sounds like sore).
What’s more is that I want to go, but won’t.  
I’ll stay here, 2000 miles away, amidst an older Eastern decay.
It turns out I have some local dead here as well: 
Fifth Great-Grandfather Christian Servoss—colonial Dutchman
from the Palatine, who died in some wintertime foolishness 
crossing the frozen Mohawk. His two boys watched him 
and his horses drown in that not-very-impressive watercourse. 
One of those boys made it to Iowa, and disappeared,
but not before he reproduced, becoming Fourth Great-Grandfather
to yours truly, and so on. My remaining colonial dead 
lie in the dirt near Palatine Bridge, their names effaced 
from marble by acid rain. I wish I didn’t care about them, but I do.
It matters to have this ghost clan near—this family I never knew.","The author's cousin is returning home to a place he reviled, having run out his luck in the West. The town is shabbier now, and the middle classes have disappeared, leaving the ancient, the angry and the slow."
The Spring Has Many Silences,"The spring has many sounds:
Roller skates grind the pavement to noisy dust.
Birds chop the still air into small melodies.
The wind forgets to be the weather for a time
And whispers old advice for summer.
The sea stretches itself
And gently creaks and cracks its bones….

The spring has many silences:
Buds are mysteriously unbound
With a discreet significance,
And buds say nothing.
There are things that even the wind will not betray.
Earth puts her finger to her lips
And muffles there her quiet, quick activity….
Do not wonder at me
That I am hushed
This April night beside you.

the hours astray  
entertained shuffling dust

truths

entretenida revolcando el polvo
Acariciando aceras  
y despedazándome 
en el rumbo mustio

Desmembrando cuerpos
con suntuosas verdades
amarillas 
Como quien besa el hielo
Como quien va 
y sin querer lo hace

cerrando los ojos firmes
por lapsos indeterminados

The dry breath,"The dry breath

ivy nights  
I concede fierceness to myself  
if it is that you flirt  
with my relief  
A veil of flowers  
covers my brief face and here  
everyone goes at their own pace 
We all share  
an irrevocable fear 
We all share  
a fragile hunger’s body 
We all share but you do not  
share yourself with me even if I want you to  
or because of it  
Some day we will know if it’s true  
that the ground withholds our steps

noches en hiebra  
Me concedo fiereza 
si es que coqueteas 
con mi alivio  
Un velo de flores  
me cubre la cara breve y aquí  
todos andan a su propio paso  
Compartimos todos 
un temor irrevocable  
Compartimos todos

Todos compartimos pero tu no  
te me compartes aunque quiero
o por eso

que el suelo retiene los pasos

In which stone was traced,"In which stone was traced 
the road before me 
What if something was dusk 
What tremendous shriek 
was behind the mirror

and smile

all about assumed feats  
To peel the scab 
obliged to the bone 
To pretend a circle’s  
divine perfection 
that gathers it all up 
with imperfect movements  
To dig my grave deep 
without knowing 
the truth of the pretext 
What of me now

What of a reflection remains 
to this carcass 
The hour of remembrance has come 
I hardly even make a noise 
or play the jokester
    En qué piedra se trazó 
antes que yo el camino  
Qué si algo fue ocaso 
Qué tremendo grito 
Qué hubo tras el espejo

The Ol' Tunes,"You kin talk about yer anthems
    An' yer arias an' sich,
An' yer modern choir-singin'
    That you think so awful rich;
But you orter heerd us youngsters
    In the times now far away,
A-singin' o' the ol' tunes
    In the ol'-fashioned way.
There was some of us sung treble
    An' a few of us growled bass,
An' the tide o' song flowed smoothly
    With its 'comp'niment o' grace;
There was spirit in that music,
    An' a kind o' solemn sway,
A-singin' o' the ol' tunes
    In the ol'-fashioned way.
I remember oft o' standin'
    In my homespun pantaloons—
On my face the bronze an' freckles
    O' the suns o' youthful Junes—
Thinkin' that no mortal minstrel
    Ever chanted sich a lay
As the ol' tunes we was singin'
    In the ol'-fashioned way.
The boys 'ud always lead, us,
    An' the girls 'ud all chime in,
Till the sweetness o' the singin'
    Robbed the list'nin' soul o' sin;
An' I used to tell the parson
    'Twas as good to sing as pray,
When the people sung the ol' tunes
    In the ol'-fashioned way.
How I long ag'in to hear 'em
    Pourin' forth from soul to soul,
With the treble high an' meller,
    An' the bass's mighty roll;
But the times is very diff'rent,
    An' the music heerd to-day
Ain't the singin' o' the ol' tunes
    In the ol'-fashioned way.
Little screechin' by a woman,
    Little squawkin' by a man,
Then the organ's twiddle-twaddle,
    Jest the empty space to span, —
An' ef you should even think it,
    'T isn't proper fur to say
That you want to hear the ol' tunes
    In the ol'-fashioned way.
But I think that some bright mornin',
    When the toils of life air o'er,
An' the sun o' heaven arisin'
    Glads with light the happy shore,
I shall hear the angel chorus,
    In the realms of endless day,
A-singin' o' the ol' tunes
    In the ol'-fashioned way.",I remember oft o' standin' in my homespun pantaloons. I used to tell the parson: 'Twas as good to sing as pray' I long to hear 'em Pourin' forth from soul to soul.
After While,"A Poem Of Faith
I think that though the clouds be dark,
That though the waves dash o'er the bark.
Yet after while the light will come,
And in calm waters safe at home
The bark will anchor.
Weep not, my sad-eyed, gray-robed maid.
Because your fairest blossoms fade,
That sorrow still o'erruns your cup,
And even though you root them up,
            The weeds grow ranker.
For after while your tears shall cease,
And sorrow shall give way to peace;
The flowers shall bloom, the weeds shall die,
And in that faith seen, by and by
Thy woes shall perish.
Smile at old Fortune's adverse tide,
Smile when the scoffers sneer and chide.
Oh, not for you the gems that pale,
And not for you the flowers that fail;
            Let this thought cherish:
That after while the clouds will part,
And then with joy the waiting heart
Shall feel the light come stealing in,
That drives away the cloud of sin
And breaks its power.
And you shall burst your chrysalis,
And wing away to realms of bliss,
Untrammelled, pure, divinely free,
Above all earth's anxiety
            From that same hour.","A Poem Of Faith by William Blake. The poem is written in the form of a sonnet. It was written by Blake for his wife, a maid."
Nature and Art,"To My Friend Charles Booth Nettleton
I
The young queen Nature, ever sweet and fair,
    Once on a time fell upon evil days.
    From hearing oft herself discussed with praise,
There grew within her heart the longing rare
To see herself; and every passing air
    The warm desire fanned into lusty blaze.
    Full oft she sought this end by devious ways,
But sought in vain, so fell she in despair,
For none within her train nor by her side
    Could solve the task or give the envied boon.
    So day and night, beneath the sun and moon,
She wandered to and fro unsatisfied,
    Till Art came by, a blithe inventive elf,
    And made a glass wherein she saw herself.
II
Enrapt, the queen gazed on her glorious self,
    Then trembling with the thrill of sudden thought,
    Commanded that the skilful wight be brought
That she might dower him with lands and pelf.
Then out upon the silent sea-lapt shelf
    And up the hills and on the downs they sought
    Him who so well and wondrously had wrought;
And with much search found and brought home the elf.
    But he put by all gifts with sad replies,
And from his lips these words flowed forth like wine:
    ""O queen, I want no gift but thee,"" he said.
She heard and looked on him with love-lit eyes,
Gave him her hand, low murmuring, ""I am thine,""
    And at the morrow's dawning they were wed.","The young queen Nature, ever sweet and fair, Once on a time fell upon evil days. From hearing oft herself discussed with praise, grew within her heart the longing rareTo see herself. Full oft she sought this end by devious ways, but sought in vain."
Eclipse Season,"after Iris Cushing
There is no empire in nerve. 
When I come home, I roam the map. 
My cursor lands on Truth or Consequences, 
and I read facts about Titanic till I’m blue. 
When I come home I’ve roamed the map. 
I tell my love what I have done Wyoming. 
The facts stack up titanic and I blue.
I don’t know what I love now, he tells me. 
I’ve done it, told my love Wyoming. 
Bit the corner off a dumpling before cooking. 
I don’t know if I love you, I should say.  
I want to see if there’s a mark left later. 
I bit the corner off this dumb thing. 
What was left behind and then uncovered? 
I want to see the mark that I felt later. 
When I got home my love was thinned obscure. 
Left behind and then uncovered, 
by noon the moon had taken the blue stage. 
My homeland, love, has been obscured, smeared
into surrounding states. Grass was growing greener. 
By two the moon had exited the stage. 
I preen into my screen and blue but I am gone. 
Grass was growing green where I should be,
bared beneath the briefly darkening desert. 
I preen into a blue screen where I’ve gone, 
a darkened noon, Wyoming under shadow,  
briefly spared beneath the blackening desert, 
an earth threaded with crescent meaning. 
At noon Wyoming slides from under shadow. 
I want to pull the fabric back, to see the other cloth. 
The threads I tend with meaning: 
dirt on my head, I should die, I would say. 
I pulled the fabric back and saw the other cloth. 
Beneath us is a net of empire sewn with nerve. 
Dirt in my mouth, I will die. 
I asked you for your weather, then your liver.",Iris Cushing’s poem ‘The facts stack up titanic and I blue’ was written after Iris Cushing was diagnosed with terminal cancer.
The Colored Soldiers,"If the muse were mine to tempt it
    And my feeble voice were strong,
If my tongue were trained to measures,
    I would sing a stirring song.
I would sing a song heroic
    Of those noble sons of Ham,
Of the gallant colored soldiers
    Who fought for Uncle Sam!
In the early days you scorned them,
    And with many a flip and flout
Said ""These battles are the white man's,
    And the whites will fight them out.""
Up the hills you fought and faltered,
    In the vales you strove and bled,
While your ears still heard the thunder
    Of the foes' advancing tread.
Then distress fell on the nation,
    And the flag was drooping low;
Should the dust pollute your banner?
    No! the nation shouted, No!
So when War, in savage triumph,
    Spread abroad his funeral pall—
Then you called the colored soldiers,
    And they answered to your call.
And like hounds unleashed and eager
    For the life blood of the prey,
Spring they forth and bore them bravely
    In the thickest of the fray.
And where'er the fight was hottest,
    Where the bullets fastest fell,
There they pressed unblanched and fearless
    At the very mouth of hell.
Ah, they rallied to the standard
    To uphold it by their might;
None were stronger in the labors,
    None were braver in the fight.
From the blazing breach of Wagner
    To the plains of Olustee,
They were foremost in the fight
    Of the battles of the free.
And at Pillow! God have mercy
    On the deeds committed there,
And the souls of those poor victims
    Sent to Thee without a prayer.
Let the fulness of Thy pity
    O'er the hot wrought spirits sway
Of the gallant colored soldiers
    Who fell fighting on that day!
Yes, the Blacks enjoy their freedom,
    And they won it dearly, too;
For the life blood of their thousands
    Did the southern fields bedew.
In the darkness of their bondage,
    In the depths of slavery's night,
Their muskets flashed the dawning,
    And they fought their way to light.
They were comrades then and brothers.
    Are they more or less to-day?
They were good to stop a bullet
    And to front the fearful fray.
They were citizens and soldiers,
    When rebellion raised its head;
And the traits that made them worthy,—
    Ah! those virtues are not dead.
They have shared your nightly vigils,
    They have shared your daily toil;
And their blood with yours commingling
    Has enriched the Southern soil.
They have slept and marched and suffered
    'Neath the same dark skies as you,
They have met as fierce a foeman,
    And have been as brave and true.
And their deeds shall find a record
    In the registry of Fame;
For their blood has cleansed completely
    Every blot of Slavery's shame.
So all honor and all glory
    To those noble sons of Ham—
The gallant colored soldiers
    Who fought for Uncle Sam!","I would sing a song heroic    Of those noble sons of Ham. They were foremost in the fight of the battles of the free. They have met as fierce a foeman, and have been as brave and true. Their deeds shall find a record in the registry of Fame."
The Dilettante: A Modern Type,"He scribbles some in prose and verse,
    And now and then he prints it;
He paints a little, — gathers some
    Of Nature's gold and mints it.
He plays a little, sings a song,
    Acts tragic roles, or funny;
He does, because his love is strong,
    But not, oh, not for money!
He studies almost everything
    From social art to science;
A thirsty mind, a flowing spring,
    Demand and swift compliance.
He looms above the sordid crowd—
    At least through friendly lenses;
While his mamma looks pleased and proud,
    And kindly pays expenses.","He studies almost everything from social art to science. He scribbles some in prose and verse, and now and then he prints it. He paints a little, — gathers some of Nature's gold and mints it."

At the Spring Dawn,"I watched the dawn come,
    Watched the spring dawn come.
And the red sun shouldered his way up
    Through the grey, through the blue,
Through the lilac mists.
The quiet of it! The goodness of it!
    And one bird awoke, sang, whirred
A blur of moving black against the sun,
    Sang again—afar off.
And I stretched my arms to the redness of the sun,
    Stretched to my finger tips,
        And I laughed.
Ah! It is good to be alive, good to love,
    At the dawn,
        At the spring dawn.","I watched the dawn come, Watched the spring dawn come. And the red sun shouldered his way up through the grey, through the blue,Through the lilac mists. And one bird awoke, sang, whirred."

Ghosts,"A hallway full of shadeless lamps suddenly goes dark
Upon the simultaneous bursting of the globes.
Glass is everywhere, and so thin it forgets
To reflect even the tiny glimmer of your
Matchlight as you pull out your wish 
Cigarette. 
This is it. The immediacy of the final desire.

to feel at home in the float
And how they commune with the living
through the lightswitch 
or the smells of honeysuckles off 
the highway upstate

In Safranbolu,"The evening I left, I went for a wash
In the neighborhood hammam. Lifted my dress.
Entered the water, which moved in rings
From me as though from a stranger, took a stick
To strip a layer of my old back.
In my bag lay a box of Turkish Delight
Meant for my parents, a book of notes, a passport
But I was holding nothing now as I floated
In pools upon pools of ancient tiled rooms.
There was a pigeon in an alcove making song,
Women in the shadows clucking disapprovingly
At me, unmarried and brazen
And free, in the windows a kind of violet smoke
I understood as twilight taking over the sky.
However hard I tried to erase the blot
My body kept bobbing back up.
I thought that’s what time was, you couldn’t lose it
Like a stone in water, that having been
Myself so long it would be forever.
And now Safranbolu doesn’t exist anymore,
At least not the one where my father
Still has years on the clock,
Where my mother’s unreason hasn’t begun,
The babies not sprung yet from their wherever,
City rich off spice, flame-colored threads of the crocus
That flowers on the hills around like blue light,
Whose gates I will pass through only in the mind:
When I slipped on my dress and reopened the door
Night had closed over the world that I knew.","Safranbolu doesn’t exist anymore, at least not the one where my father still has years on the clock. The city rich off spice, flame-colored threads of the crocus, flowers on the hills around like blue light."
Black Lead in a Nancy Meyers Film,"Aging, at all. I want that. And to fall

Lion,"I chewed into the wreck of the world,
into the neckbone of the past that pursued me.
All the while, I moved toward extinction,
bearing the burden of damage, language of the protector.
A great apocalyptic wheeze adorned me with sand. 
I foraged, first to find light dappling the leaves,
then breathed into an infinite power, feminine rust,
a coppery taste of salvage, leading me into a canopy
of the future. My mother was a mother of mothers,
modern before she was ancestral.
She was a woman who morphed into feline, back
to her human self before I woke each morning.
I lived not to sate my appetite but to crush it.
On my haunches, I craved what could not be seen.

Pastoral,"A frog leaps out across the lawn,
And crouches there—all heavy and alone,
And like a blossom, pale and over-blown,
Once more the moon turns dim against the dawn.
Crawling across the straggling panoply
Of little roses, only half in bloom,
It strides within that beamed and lofty room
Where an ebon stallion looms upon the hay.
The stillness moves, and seems to grow immense,
A shuddering dog starts, dragging at its chain,
Thin, dusty rats slink down within the grain,
And in the vale the first far bells commence.
Here in the dawn, with mournful doomèd eyes
A cow uprises, moving out to bear
A soft-lipped calf with swarthy birth-swirled hair,
And wide wet mouth, and droll uncertainties.
The grey fowls fight for places in the sun,
The mushrooms flare, and pass like painted fans:
All the world is patient in its plans—
The seasons move forever, one on one.
Small birds lie sprawling vaguely in the heat,
And wanly pluck at shadows on their breasts,
And where the heavy grape-vine leans and rests,
White butterflies lift up their furry feet.
The wheat grows querulous with unseen cats;
A fox strides out in anger through the corn,
Bidding each acre wake and rise to mourn
Beneath its sharps and through its throaty flats.
And so it is, and will be year on year,
Time in and out of date, and still on time
A billion grapes plunge bleeding into wine
And bursting, fall like music on the ear.
The snail that marks the girth of night with slime,
The lonely adder hissing in the fern,
The lizard with its ochre eyes aburn—
Each is before, and each behind its time.","The seasons move forever, one on one. A frog leaps out across the lawn, and crouches there—all heavy and alone,                And like a blossom, pale and over-blown, once more the moon turns dim against the dawn."
A Border Ballad,"Oh, I haven't got long to live, for we all
    Die soon, e'en those who live longest;
And the poorest and weakest are taking their chance
    Along with the richest and strongest.
So it's heigho for a glass and a song,
    And a bright eye over the table,
And a dog for the hunt when the game is flush.
    And the pick of a gentleman's stable.
There is Dimmock o' Dune, he was here yester-night,
    But he's rotting to-day on Glen Arragh;
'Twas the hand o' MacPherson that gave him the blow,
    And the vultures shall feast on his marrow.
But it's heigho for a brave old song
    And a glass while we are able;
Here's a health to death and another cup
    To the bright eye over the table.
I can show a broad back and a jolly deep chest,
    But who argues now on appearance?
A blow or a thrust or a stumble at best
    May send me to-day to my clearance.
Then it's heigho for the things I love,
    My mother'll be soon wearing sable,
But give me my horse and my dog and my glass,
    And a bright eye over the table.","Dimmock o' Dune, he was here yester-night, but he's rotting to-day on Glen Arragh. The poorest and weakest are taking their chance, along with the richest and strongest."
Columbian Ode,"I.
Four hundred years ago a tangled waste
   Lay sleeping on the west Atlantic's side;
Their devious ways the Old World's millions traced
   Content, and loved, and labored, dared and died.
While students still believed the charts they conned,
   And revelled in their thriftless ignorance,
Nor dreamed of other lands that lay beyond
   Old Ocean's dense, indefinite expanse.
II.
But deep within her heart old Nature knew
   That she had once arrayed, at Earth's behest,
Another offspring, fine and fair to view,—
   The chosen suckling of the mother's breast.
The child was wrapped in vestments soft and fine,
   Each fold a work of Nature's matchless art;
The mother looked on it with love divine,
   And strained the loved one closely to her heart.
And there it lay, and with the warmth grew strong
   And hearty, by the salt sea breezes fanned,
Till Time with mellowing touches passed along,
   And changed the infant to a mighty land.
III.
But men knew naught of this, till there arose
   That mighty mariner, the Genoese,
Who dared to try, in spite of fears and foes,
   The unknown fortunes of unsounded seas.
O noblest of Italia's sons, thy bark
   Went not alone into that shrouding night!
O dauntless darer of the rayless dark,
   The world sailed with thee to eternal light!
The deer-haunts that with game were crowded then
   To-day are tilled and cultivated lands;
The schoolhouse tow'rs where Bruin had his den,
   And where the wigwam stood the chapel stands;
The place that nurtured men of savage mien
   Now teems with men of Nature's noblest types;
Where moved the forest-foliage banner green,
   Now flutters in the breeze the stars and stripes!","Hundreds of years ago a tangled waste of land lay sleeping on the west Atlantic's side. The Old World's millions traced it, and loved, and labored, dared and died."
Night of Love,"The moon has left the sky, love,
    The stars are hiding now,
And frowning on the world, love,
    Night bares her sable brow.
The snow is on the ground, love,
    And cold and keen the air is.
I'm singing here to you, love;
    You're dreaming there in Paris.
But this is Nature's law, love,
    Though just it may not seem,
That men should wake to sing, love;
    While maidens sleep and dream.
Them care may not molest, love,
    Nor stir them from their slumbers,
Though midnight find the swain, love.
    Still halting o'er his numbers.
I watch the rosy dawn, love,
    Come stealing up the east,
While all things round rejoice, love,
    That Night her reign has ceased.
The lark will soon be heard, love,
    And on his way be winging;
When Nature's poets wake, love,

Portrait of My Gender as [Inaudible],"I knew I was a god
when you could not
agree on my name
& still, none you spoke
could force me to listen
closer. Is this the nothing
the antelope felt when
Adam, lit on his own
entitling, dubbed family,
genus, species? So many
descendants became
doctors, delivered
babies, bestowed bodies
names as if to say it is to make it
so. Can it be a comfort between
us, the fact of my creation?
I was made in the image
of a thing without
an image & silence, too,
is your invention. Who prays
for a god except to appear
with answers, but never
a body? A voice? If I told you
you wouldn’t believe me
because I was the one
to say it. On the first day
there was no sound
worth mentioning. If  I, too,
am a conductor of air, the only
praise I know is in stereo
(one pair—an open hand & closed
fist—will have to do). I made
a photograph of my name:
there was a shadow in a field
& I put my shadow in it. You
can’t hear me, but I’m there.","I was made in the image of a thing without an image & silence, too, too. Who prays for a god except to appear with answers, but never with a body? A voice? If I told you you wouldn’t believe me because I was the one who had to say it."
Day-Dreams,"We’d build a little bungalow,
If you and I were one,
And carefully we’d plan it, so
We’d get the morning sun.
I’d rise each day at rosy dawn
And bustle gaily down;
In evening’s cool, you’d spray the lawn
When you came back from town.
A little cook-book I should buy,
Your dishes I’d prepare;
And though they came out black and dry,
I know you wouldn’t care.
How valiantly I’d strive to learn,
Assured you’d not complain!
And if my finger I should burn,
You’d kiss away the pain.
I’d buy a little scrubbing-brush
And beautify the floors;
I’d warble gaily as a thrush
About my little chores.
But though I’d cook and sew and scrub,
A higher life I’d find;
I’d join a little women’s club
And cultivate my mind.
If you and I were one, my dear,
A model life we’d lead.
We’d travel on, from year to year,
At no increase of speed.
Ah, clear to me the vision of
The things that we should do!
And so I think it best, my love,
To string along as two.","If you and I were one, my dear, a model life we’d lead. We’'d build a little bungalow, and carefully plan it, so we could get the morning sun. I’‘d join a little women’s club; cultivate my mind.’ ‘If my finger I should burn, you’ would kiss away the pain’"

Ballade of a Great Weariness,"There’s little to have but the things I had,
    There’s little to bear but the things I bore.
There’s nothing to carry and naught to add,
    And glory to Heaven, I paid the score.
There’s little to do but I did before,
    There’s little to learn but the things I know;
And this is the sum of a lasting lore:
    Scratch a lover, and find a foe.
And couldn’t it be I was young and mad
    If ever my heart on my sleeve I wore?
There’s many to claw at a heart unclad,
    And little the wonder it ripped and tore.
There’s one that’ll join in their push and roar,
    With stories to jabber, and stones to throw;
He’ll fetch you a lesson that costs you sore—
    Scratch a lover, and find a foe.
So little I’ll offer to you, my lad;
    It’s little in loving I set my store.
There’s many a maid would be flushed and glad,
    And better you’ll knock at a kindlier door.
I’ll dig at my lettuce, and sweep my floor—
    Forever, forever I’m done with woe—
And happen I’ll whistle about my chore,
    “Scratch a lover, and find a foe.”

They Part,"And if, my friend, you’d have it end,
    There’s naught to hear or tell.
But need you try to black my eye
    In wishing me farewell?
Though I admit an edgèd wit
    In woe is warranted,
May I be frank? . . . Such words as “——”
    Are better left unsaid.
There’s rosemary for you and me;
    But is it usual, dear,

Rainy Night,"Ghosts of all my lovely sins,
     Who attend too well my pillow,
Gay the wanton rain begins;
     Hide the limp and tearful willow.
Turn aside your eyes and ears,
     Trail away your robes of sorrow,
You shall have my further years,—
     You shall walk with me tomorrow.
I am sister to the rain;
     Fey and sudden and unholy,
Petulant at the windowpane,
     Quickly lost, remembered slowly.
I have lived with shades, a shade;
     I am hung with graveyard flowers.
Let me be tonight arrayed
     In the silver of the showers.
Every fragile thing shall rust;
     When another April passes
I may be a furry dust,
     Sifting through the brittle grasses.
All sweet sins shall be forgot;
     Who will live to tell their siring?
Hear me now, nor let me rot
     Wistful still, and still aspiring.
Ghosts of dear temptations, heed;
     I am frail, be you forgiving.
See you not that I have need
     To be living with the living?
Sail, tonight, the Styx’s breast;
     Glide among the dim processions
Of the exquisite unblest,
     Spirits of my shared transgressions. 
Roam with young Persephone,
     Plucking poppies for your slumber …
With the morrow, there shall be
     One more wraith among your number.","I am sister to the rain; I have lived with shades, a shade; I am hung with graveyard flowers. Ghosts of all my lovely sins, attend too well my pillow, gay the wanton rain begins."
The New Love,"If it shine or if it rain,
     Little will I care or know.
Days, like drops upon a pane,
     Slip, and join, and go.
At my door’s another lad;
     Here's his flower in my hair.
If he see me pale and sad,
     Will he see me fair?
I sit looking at the floor.
     Little will I think or say
If he seek another door;
     Even if he stay.","If he see me pale and sad, he will not see me fair. If it shine or if it rain, little will I care or know."
Hearthside,"Half across the world from me
Lie the lands I'll never see—
I, whose longing lives and dies
Where a ship has sailed away;
I, that never close my eyes
But to look upon Cathay.
Things I may not know nor tell
Wait, where older waters swell;
Ways that flowered at Sappho’s tread,
Winds that sighed in Homer’s strings,
Vibrant with the singing dead,
Golden with the dust of wings.
Under deeper skies than mine,
Quiet valleys dip and shine.
Where their tender grasses heal
Ancient scars of trench and tomb
I shall never walk: nor kneel
Where the bones of poets bloom.
If I seek a lovelier part,
Where I travel goes my heart;
Where I stray my thought must go;
With me wanders my desire.
Best to sit and watch the snow,
Turn the lock, and poke the fire.","The poem was written in the first half of the 20th century. It is set in a fictional land called Cathay, half a world away from the author."
Paths,"I shall tread, another year,
     Ways I walked with Grief,
Past the dry, ungarnered ear
     And the brittle leaf.
I shall stand, a year apart,
     Wondering, and shy,
Thinking, “Here she broke her heart;
     Here she pled to die.”
I shall hear the pheasants call,
     And the raucous geese;
Down these ways, another Fall,
     I shall walk with Peace.
But the pretty path I trod
     Hand-in-hand with Love,—
Underfoot, the nascent sod,
     Brave young boughs above,
And the stripes of ribbon grass
     By the curling way—
I shall never dare to pass
     To my dying day.","I shall tread, another year, Ways I walked with Grief, past the dry, ungarnered ear and brittle leaf. I shall hear the pheasants call and the raucous geese; down these ways, another Fall, I shall walk with Peace."
To a Much Too Unfortunate Lady,"He will love you presently
If you be the way you be.
Send your heart a-skittering.
He will stoop, and lift the thing.
Be your dreams as thread, to tease
Into patterns he shall please.
Let him see your passion is
Ever tenderer than his....
Go and bless your star above,
Thus are you, and thus is Love.
He will leave you white with woe,
If you go the way you go.
If your dreams were thread to weave,
He will pluck them from his sleeve.
If your heart had come to rest,
He will flick it from his breast.
Tender though the love he bore,
You had loved a little more....
Lady, go and curse your star,
Thus Love is, and thus you are.","He will leave you white with woe, if you go the way you go. He will love you presently. If your dreams were thread to weave, he will pluck them from his sleeve."
Epitaph for a Darling Lady,"All her hours were yellow sands,
Blown in foolish whorls and tassels;
Slipping warmly through her hands;
Patted into little castles.
Shiny day on shiny day
Tumble in a rainbow clutter,
As she flipped them all away,
Sent them spinning down the gutter.
Leave for her a red young rose,
Go your way, and save your pity;
She is happy, for she knows
That her dust is very pretty.","All her hours were yellow sands,                Blown in foolish whorls and tassels.                Slipping warmly through her hands;                Patted into little castles.                Shiny day on shiny day                Tumble in a rainbow clutter.                Leave for her a red young rose,                Go your way, and save your pity."
Love Song,"My own dear love, he is strong and bold
     And he cares not what comes after.
His words ring sweet as a chime of gold,

He is jubilant as a flag unfurled—
     Oh, a girl, she’d not forget him.
My own dear love, he is all my world,—
     And I wish I’d never met him.
My love, he’s mad, and my love, he’s fleet,
     And a wild young wood-thing bore him!
The ways are fair to his roaming feet,
     And the skies are sunlit for him.
As sharply sweet to my heart he seems
     As the fragrance of acacia.
My own dear love, he is all my dreams,—
     And I wish he were in Asia.
My love runs by like a day in June,
     And he makes no friends of sorrows.
He’ll tread his galloping rigadoon
     In the pathway of the morrows.
He’ll live his days where the sunbeams start,
     Nor could storm or wind uproot him.

Braggart,"The days will rally, wreathing
Their crazy tarantelle;
And you must go on breathing,
But I'll be safe in hell.
Like January weather,
The years will bite and smart,
And pull your bones together
To wrap your chattering heart.
The pretty stuff you're made of
Will crack and crease and dry.
The thing you are afraid of
Will look from every eye.
You will go faltering after
The bright, imperious line,
And split your throat on laughter,
And burn your eyes with brine.
You will be frail and musty
With peering, furtive head,
Whilst I am young and lusty
Among the roaring dead.","""I am young and lustyAmong the roaring dead"" is a song by British singer-songwriter David Walliams. The song was written in the 1970s and features a number of famous artists. It was released as part of the 50th anniversary of the first edition of the book."

Spring Song,"(In the Expected Manner)
Enter April, laughingly,
     Blossoms in her tumbled hair,
High of heart, and fancy-free—
     When was maiden half so fair?
Bright her eyes with easy tears,
     Wanton-sweet, her smiles for men.
“Winter’s gone,” she cries, “and here’s Spring again.”
When we loved, ‘twas April, too;
     Madcap April—urged us on.
Just as she did, so did you—
     Sighed, and smiled, and then were gone.
How she plied her pretty arts,
     How she laughed and sparkled then!

Keep me from the old distress;

Men,"They hail you as their morning star

Ballade at Thirty-five,"This, no song of an ingénue,

Wearing shower bouquets of rue,
     Walk I ever in penitence.
Oft I roam, as my heart repents,
     Through God’s acre of memory,
Marking stones, in my reverence,
     “I loved them until they loved me.”
Pictures pass me in long review,—

Song of Perfect Propriety,"Oh, I should like to ride the seas,

A Portrait,"Because my love is quick to come and go—
A little here, and then a little there—
What use are any words of mine to swear
My heart is stubborn, and my spirit slow
Of weathering the drip and drive of woe? 
What is my oath, when you have but to bare
My little, easy loves; and I can dare
Only to shrug, and answer, “They are so”?

You do not know how heavy a heart it is 
That hangs about my neck—a clumsy stone 
Cut with a birth, a death, a bridal-day. 
Each time I love, I find it still my own, 
Who take it, now to that lad, now to this, 
Seeking to give the wretched thing away. ","""My heart is stubborn, and my spirit slow,"" he writes. ""Each time I love, I find it still my own"" ""You do not know how heavy a heart it is"""
The Immortals,"If you should sail for Trebizond, or die, 
Or cry another name in your first sleep, 
Or see me board a train, and fail to sigh, 
Appropriately, I’d clutch my breast and weep. 
And you, if I should wander through the door, 
Or sin, or seek a nunnery, or save
My lips and give my cheek, would tread the floor
And aptly mention poison and the grave. 

Therefore the mooning world is gratified,
Quoting how prettily we sigh and swear; 
And you and I, correctly side by side, 
Shall live as lovers when our bones are bare; 
And though we lie forever enemies, 
Shall rank with Abélard and Héloïse. ","If you should sail for Trebizond, or die, or cry another name in your first sleep, or see me board a train, and fail to sigh, I’d clutch my breast and weep.

Condolence,"They hurried here, as soon as you had died, 
Their faces damp with haste and sympathy, 
And pressed my hand in theirs, and smoothed my knee, 
And clicked their tongues, and watched me, mournful-eyed. 
Gently they told me of that Other Side—
How, even then, you waited there for me, 
And what ecstatic meeting ours would be. 
Moved by the lovely tale, they broke, and cried. 

And when I smiled, they told me I was brave, 
And they rejoiced that I was comforted, 
And left, to tell of all the help they gave. 
But I had smiled to think how you, the dead, 
So curiously preoccupied and grave, 
Would laugh, could you have heard the things they said.

“I Shall Come Back”,"I shall come back without fanfaronade
Of wailing wind and graveyard panoply; 
But, trembling, slip from cool Eternity—
A mild and most bewildered little shade. 
I shall not make sepulchral midnight raid, 
But softly come where I had longed to be 
In April twilight’s unsung melody, 
And I, not you, shall be the one afraid. 

Strange, that from lovely dreamings of the dead 
I shall come back to you, who hurt me most. 
You may not feel my hand upon your head, 
I’ll be so new and inexpert a ghost. 
Perhaps you will not know that I am near,—
And that will break my ghostly heart, my dear. ","""I shall come back without fanfaronade of wailing wind and graveyard panoply"" ""I’ll be so new and inexpert a ghost. Perhaps you will not know that I am near,"" he writes."
Testament,"Oh, let it be a night of lyric rain
And singing breezes, when my bell is tolled. 
I have so loved the rain that I would hold 
Last in my ears its friendly, dim refrain. 
I shall lie cool and quiet, who have lain 
Fevered, and watched the book of day unfold. 
Death will not see my flinch; the heart is bold
That pain has made incapable of pain. 

Kinder the busy worms than ever love; 
It will be peace to lie there, empty-eyed, 
My bed made secret by the leveling showers, 
My breast replenishing the weeds above. 
And you will say of me, “Then has she died?
Perhaps I should have sent a spray of flowers.” ","""I have so loved the rain that I would hold  last in my ears its friendly, dim refrain. Oh, let it be a night of lyric rain and singing breezes, when my bell is tolled"""
I Know I Have Been Happiest,"I know I have been happiest at your side; 
But what is done, is done, and all’s to be. 
And small the good, to linger dolefully,—
Gaily it lived, and gallantly it died.
I will not make you songs of hearts denied, 
And you, being man, would have no tears of me, 
And should I offer you fidelity, 
You’d be, I think, a little terrified. 

Yet this the need of woman, this her curse:
To range her little gifts, and give, and give, 
Because the throb of giving’s sweet to bear. 
To you, who never begged me vows or verse, 
My gift shall be my absence, while I live; 
But after that, my dear, I cannot swear. ","I will not make you songs of hearts denied, he writes. I know I have been happiest at your side. But what is done, is done and all’s to be. The throb of giving is sweet to bear."
The White Lady,"I cannot rest, I cannot rest 
   In strait and shiny wood, 
My woven hands upon my breast—
   The dead are all so good! 

The earth is cool across their eyes; 
    They lie there quietly. 
But I am neither old nor wise, 
    They do not welcome me. 

Where never I walked alone before
   I wander in the weeds; 
And people scream and bar the door, 
   And rattle at their beads. 

We cannot rest, we never rest
   Within a narrow bed
Who still must love the living best—
    Who hate the drowsy dead! ","I cannot rest, I cannot rest   In strait and shiny wood,                 My woven hands upon my breast. The dead are all so good! I am neither old nor wise."
August,"When my eyes are weeds, 
And my lips are petals, spinning 
Down the wind that has beginning 
Where the crumpled beeches start
In a fringe of salty reeds; 
When my arms are elder-bushes, 
And the rangy lilac pushes
Upward, upward through my heart; 

Summer, do your worst!
Light your tinsel moon, and call on 
Your performing stars to fall on
Headlong through your paper sky; 
Nevermore shall I be cursed
By a flushed and amorous slattern, 
With her dusty laces’ pattern
Trailing, as she straggles by. ","""When my arms are elder-bushes,                 And the rangy lilac pushes                Upward, upward through my heart"" ""Nevermore shall I be cursed by a flushed and amorous slattern"""

Verse for a Certain Dog,"Such glorious faith as fills your limpid eyes,
       Dear little friend of mine, I never knew.
All-innocent are you, and yet all-wise.

You look about, and all you see is fair;
       This mighty globe was made for you alone.
Of all the thunderous ages, you’re the heir.

A skeptic world you face with steady gaze;
       High in young pride you hold your noble head;
Gayly you meet the rush of roaring days.

Lancelike your courage, gleaming swift and strong,
       Yours the white rapture of a wingèd soul,
Yours is a spirit like a May-day song.

“Whatever is, is good,” your gracious creed.
       You wear your joy of living like a crown.
Love lights your simplest act, your every deed.

You are God’s kindliest gift of all,—a friend.

You ask but leave to follow to the end.

The Cow Speaks to the Child,"There’s no me without you, 
says the cow in the sunlight 
being looked at, being drawn 
by the child with crayons. 
Is the hill an almond? the child 
wants to know. Is life irrefutable? 
The start of ‘me’ is the start of 
the ending of ‘you.’ See that hole
in your sock where
the cold can get through?
The child’s toe sticks 
through the hole now.
Some philosophers grow ulcers 
from eating loneliness. 
There’s not much we know.
The cow’s tongue smacks its lips. 
The child fills in its spots 
with blue crayon and silence. 
A dragonfly or not.","There’s no me without you, says the cow in the sunlight. The child fills in its spots with blue crayon and silence. Some philosophers grow ulcers from eating loneliness."
Glossolalia,"My baby brandishes a wooden knife
meant to halve a wooden shallot
as he hollers his newest word. Knife.
Look at my son, flashing
his dagger, jamming it into plush
animals. Knife, knife. Look at him,
oblivious to the weapons
littering his lineage or, God forbid,
possessed by them. Can the babies
planted in the dirt of our bodies
absorb the torments buried there?
My gentle, watchful child
wants all the knives. But some days,
everywhere, blue. The bear, blue.
The bells, blue, the car, the cup,
the light. I marvel at my son,
who marvels at the sky—blue, blue—
no matter how gray the bully of clouds.
And this is all I want.
Look at my son laughing at the rain.
Look how he prods the window
with his knife, insisting
we cut up the storm, demanding 
the blue back into view.","My gentle, watchful child                wants all the knives. But some days,                everywhere, blue. The bear, blue, the car, the cup, the light. I marvel at my son, who marvels at the sky. And this is all I want."
Red-Lipped Poem,"You only respond
to marrow
scooped clean.
You stare. I touch
your silk. Shiver. Some nights,
you let in a kiss abruptly
through the mask. Pant.
            Here, your bread,
sliced into neat warm ovals.
Whisper. It’s impossible. Is it
that you have nowhere
to go? No. Your family
loves you. But here you are
the only monster. The last
and first star: the one
in the clan who won’t stay put.
Tonight, you arrive;
you said you wouldn’t.
Here, a linen napkin;
we can't always afford it.
I do not always have
what you lope about
seeking. It isn’t so easy
to keep the harness buckled.
            Be still. Only we know
how this works.","You stare. I touch your silk. Shiver. Some nights, you let in a kiss abruptly through the mask. Is it because you have nowhere to go? No. Your family loves you. But here you are the only monster."
Patients,"Why do they call us ""the patient""
We are not patient.  We endure.
The anxious tedium of public hospital 
waiting rooms, because waiting
is the punishment of the poor;
interminable buses to inconvenient places
where we count up our cash, calculating
whether we can take a cab home 
instead of riding our exhaustion;
the angry contempt of specialists, taught to believe
any pain they cannot explain is insubordinate,
deliberate, offensive.
We are not patient. We are denied.
Not medically necessary, they say, not proven.
Feel free to appeal.  We are experts at appealing,
so we begin again, gathering documents, faxing releases,
collecting letters and signatures, 
giving our numbers, all our numbers, 
to dozens of indifferent, underpaid clerks,
stacking up evidence for the hearing, where we will declare
as civilly as we can to the affronted panels
that it is necessary that we breathe,
sleep, digest, be eased of pain, have medicines
and therapies and machines, 
and that we not be required to beg.
While I am waiting, I am using my pen,
steadily altering words.
Where the card says ""medically indigent"" 
I cross it out and write indignant.
Where my records say ""chemically sensitive""
I write chemically assaulted, chemically wounded,
chemically outraged. On the form listing risk factors
for cancer, I write in my candidates: agribusiness, 
air fresheners, dry cleaning, river water, farm life,
bathing, drinking, eating, vinyl, cosmetics, plastic, greed. 
I am making an intricate graffiti poem
out of mountains of unnecessary paperwork.
Where the doctor has written ""disheveled"" I write untamed.
Where it says ""refused treatment,"" I write refused to be lied to.
Where it says safe, side effects minimal
I say prove it. What do you mean minimal?
What do you mean side? I write
unmarketed effects unmentionable.
Where it asks, authorization?  I write inherent,
authorized from birth.  
Are you the patient? she asks, ready to transfer my call.
I say only with my own sweet, brave body.
I say, Not today, no.  I have no patience left.
I am the person who is healing, I say, 
in spite of everything. I will have to put you on hold she says. Yes,
hold me I say. That would be good. ","The anxious tedium of public hospital waiting rooms is the punishment of the poor. The angry contempt of specialists, taught to believe any pain they cannot explain is insubordinate, is offensive. Why do they call us ""the patient""?"
One Way or Another,"it is you who leaves. So I set out

A Cloud of Drench Bearing Down,"An odor in the breeze—spruce; palosanto; silver dust

Sick4Sick,"I think my lover’s cane is sexy. The way they walk

How, with fingers laced together, our boots & canes

We share so many symptoms, the first time we thought
to hyphenate our names was, playfully, to christen
ourselves a new disorder. We trade tips on medication,
on how to weather what prescriptions make you sick 
to [maybe] make you well. We make toasts with
acetaminophen bought in bulk. Kiss in the airport 
terminal through surgical masks. Rub the knots from 
each others’ backs. We dangle FALL RISK bracelets
from our walls & call it decoration. We visit another
ER & call it a date. When we are sick, again, for months
—with a common illness that will not leave—it is not 
the doctors who care for us. We make do ourselves.

like a three-day-bruise, littered with satellites I keep
mistaking for stars—our bodies are fever-sweat stitched.

Over His Dead Body,"of him,

a threnody’d squawk of chickens,
of hundreds squabbled to grocers from farms;
stiffened in hells of stoves, at least,
as trundled bones on plates that lair

crack’d apart of eggs, babes against
affrightful skillets glee’d by grease;
nameless butchers that pummell’d
the gory steaks for abrupt of his fork
and teeth; unraveled bacon by the yard
moving its char along his tubes,
could not be held, could not leave much;
oysters could not save a thing;
nor could shrimp from plundered shallows,
neckbones, heavy pork shops,
do much –– nor could groundround

lush’d with butter, failed completely

But I am old; and good and bad
Are woven in a crazy plaid.

The difference is small, my son.”

Brides in organdie;
Gingham’s for the plighted maid;

Crape’s to calm the old;
Velvet hides an empty breast;

     Young and free and fair—
And in the morning light
He left me there.
Then Sorrow came to stay,
And lay upon my breast;
He walked with me in the day,
And knew me best.
I’ll never be a bride,
Nor yet celibate,
So I’m living now with Pride—
A cold bedmate.
He must not hear nor see,
Nor could he forgive
That Sorrow still visits me
Each day I live.  ","JOY stayed with me a night and left me there. Then Sorrow came to stay and lay upon my breast. I’ll never be a bride, nor yet celibate, so I'm living now with Pride. Pride is a cold bedmate."
Epitaph,"THE first time I died, I walked my ways;
     I followed the file of limping days.
I held me tall, with my head flung up,
But I dared not look on the new moon’s cup.
I dared not look on the sweet young rain,
And between my ribs was a gleaming pain.
The next time I died, they laid me deep.
They spoke worn words to hallow my sleep.
They tossed me petals, they wreathed me fern,
They weighted me down with a marble urn.
And I lie here warm, and I lie here dry,
And watch the worms slip by, slip by.","Between my ribs was a gleaming pain. The next time I died, they laid me deep. They spoke worn words to hallow my sleep.

The Dark Girl’s Rhyme,"WHO was there had seen us
         Wouldn’t bid him run?
Heavy lay between us
    All our sires had done.
There he was, a-springing,
    Of a pious race—
Setting hags a-swinging,
     In a market-place;
Sowing turnips over
     Where the poppies lay;
Looking past the clover,
      Adding up the hay;
Shouting through the Spring song,
      Clumping down the sod;
Toadying, in sing-song
      To a crabbèd god.
There I was, that came of
      Folk of mud and flame—
I that had my name of
      Them without a name.
Up and down a mountain
      Streeled my silly stock;
Passing by a fountain,
      Wringing at a rock;
Devil-gotten sinners,
      Throwing back their heads;
Fiddling for their dinners,
      Kissing for their beds.
Not a one had seen us
      Wouldn’t help him flee.
Angry ran between us
      Blood of him and me.
How shall I be mating
      Who have looked above—
Living for a hating,
      Dying of a love?

Convalescent,"HOW shall I wail, that wasn’t meant for weeping?
     Love has run and left me, oh, what then?
Dream, then, I must, who never can be sleeping;
What if I should meet Love, once again?
What if I met him, walking on the highway?
Let him see how lightly I should care.
He’d travel his way, I would follow my way;
Hum a little song, and pass him there.
What if at night, beneath a sky of ashes,
He should seek my doorstep, pale with need?
There he could lie, and dry would be my lashes;
Let him stop his noise, and let me read.
Oh, but I’m gay, that’s better off without him;
Would he’d come and see me, laughing here.
Lord!  Don’t I know I’d have my arms about him,
Crying to him, “Oh, come in, my dear!”","How shall I wail, that wasn’t meant for weeping?  Love has run and left me, oh, what then? He should seek my doorstep, pale with need, and dry would be my lashes."
A Well-Worn Story,"IN April, in April,
   My one love came along,
And I ran the slope of my high hill
To follow a thread of song.
His eyes were hard as porphyry
With looking on cruel lands;
His voice went slipping over me
Like terrible silver hands.
Together we trod the secret lane
And walked the muttering town.
I wore my heart like a wet, red stain
On the breast of a velvet gown.
In April, in April,
My love went whistling by,
And I stumbled here to my high hill
Along the way of a lie.
Now what should I do in this place
But sit and count the chimes,
And splash cold water on my face
And spoil a page with rhymes. ","In April, in April, my one love came along,                And I ran the slope of my high hill                To follow a thread of song.                His eyes were hard as porphyry                With looking on cruel lands;                His voice went slipping over me                Like terrible silver hands."
A Very Short Song,"ONCE, when I was young and true,
        Someone left me sad—
Broke my brittle heart in two;
     And that is very bad.
Love is for unlucky folk,
     Love is but a curse.
Once there was a heart I broke;
     And that, I think, is worse.
 ","Once there was a heart I broke; once I was young and true. Someone left me sad;Broke my brittle heart in two. And that, I think, is worse."
The Trifler,"DEATH’S the lover that I’d be taking;
      Wild and fickle and fierce is he.
Small’s his care if my heart be breaking—
   Gay young Death would have none of me.
Hear them clack of my haste to greet him!
   No one other my mouth had kissed.
I had dressed me in silk to meet him—
   False young Death would not hold the tryst.
Slow’s the blood that was quick and stormy,
   Smooth and cold is the bridal bed;
I must wait till he whistles for me—
   Proud young Death would not turn his head.
I must wait till my breast is wilted,
   I must wait till my back is bowed,
I must rock in the corner, jilted,—
   Death went galloping down the road.
Gone’s my heart with a trifling rover.
    Fine he was in the game he played—
Kissed, and promised, and threw me over,
    And rode away with a prettier maid.
 
 ","""I must wait till my breast is wilted, I must rock in the corner, jilted,"" the poet writes. ""Gone’s my heart with a trifling rover. Fine he was in the game he played, and threw me over"""
The False Friends,"THEY laid their hands upon my head,
They stroked my cheek and brow;
And time could heal a hurt, they said,
And time could dim a vow.
And they were pitiful and mild
Who whispered to me then,
“The heart that breaks in April, child,
Will mend in May again.”
Oh, many a mended heart they knew,
So old they were, and wise.
And little did they have to do
To come to me with lies!
Who flings me silly talk of May
Shall meet a bitter soul;
For June was nearly spent away
Before my heart was whole.
 ","“The heart that breaks in April, child, will mend in May again” “Many a mended heart they knew, so old they were, and wise’ “ “Time could heal a hurt, they said, and time could dim a vow”"
The Small Hours,"NO more my little song comes back;
       And now of nights I lay
My head on down, to watch the black
     And wait the unfailing gray.
Oh, sad are winter nights, and slow;
     And sad’s a song that’s dumb
And sad it is to lie and know
     Another dawn will come.","No more my little song comes back; it's over. And now of nights I lay my head on down, to watch the black turn to gray. And wait the unfailing gray."

Threnody,"LILACS blossom just as sweet
Now my heart is shattered.
If I bowled it down the street,
Who’s to say it mattered?
If there’s one that rode away
What would I be missing?
Lips that taste of tears, they say,
Are the best for kissing.
Eyes that watch the morning star
Seem a little brighter;
Arms held out to darkness are
Usually whiter.
Shall I bar the strolling guest,
Bind my brow with willow,
When, they say, the empty breast
Is softer than the pillow?
That a heart falls tinkling down,
Never think it ceases.
Every likely lad in town
Gathers up the pieces.
If there’s one gone whistling by
Would I let it grieve me?
Let him wonder if I lie;
Let him half believe me.

Welcome to the Gut House,"Outside a door in east Maui, a brindled dog sits.

how to speed through marrow. They know

cleaned as cleaned of secrets. Yes, there is something
            better than the heart. A whirring
sent deep in the body. Like a girl in a house.
            You are finally home. 
No glorified organ, no heroic heart. Only guts.

crumbled—poof—then paved over, engraved like verses
into stone. When I was told what happened to you,
I sank to the wet floor of a bar’s bathroom, furious
that you left us to reassemble ourselves
from rubble. To build, between subway stops,
some saccharine monument
pigeons shit on, empty except for a circle of queens 
chattering, furnishing the air like ghosts. Your death
means I’m always equidistant from you, 
no matter where I travel, where I linger, 
misguided, hopeful. Last night, by candle light,
a woman unearthed me. 
Together, she and I grieved 
the impossibility of disappearing 
into one another. Poof. Since you died,
erasure obsesses me. Among the photos at the memorial,

I Sought the Wood in Winter,"I sought the wood in summer
             When every twig was green;
The rudest boughs were tender,
            And buds were pink between.
Light-fingered aspens trembled
            In fitful sun and shade,
And daffodils were golden
            In every starry glade.
The brook sang like a robin—
            My hand could check him where
The lissome maiden willows
            Shook out their yellow hair.
“How frail a thing is Beauty,”
            I said, “when every breath
She gives the vagrant summer
            But swifter woos her death.
For this the star dust troubles,
            For this have ages rolled:
To deck the wood for bridal
            And slay her with the cold.”
I sought the wood in winter
            When every leaf was dead;
Behind the wind-whipped branches
            The winter sun set red.
The coldest star was rising
            To greet that bitter air,
The oaks were writhen giants;
            Nor bud nor bloom was there.
The birches, white and slender,
            In deathless marble stood,
The brook, a white immortal,
            Slept silent in the wood.
“How sure a thing is Beauty,”
            I cried. “No bolt can slay,
No wave nor shock despoil her,
            No ravishers dismay.
Her warriors are the angels
            That cherish from afar,
Her warders people Heaven
            And watch from every star.
The granite hills are slighter,
            The sea more like to fail;
Behind the rose the planet,
            The Law behind the veil.”","I sought the wood in summer when every twig was green; the rudest boughs were tender; buds were pink between; daffodils were golden; the brook sang like a robin. “How frail a thing is Beauty,” I said, “when every breath she gives the vagrant summer’s death.” “No wave nor shock despoil her,’ I cried; “no ravishers dismay’"
De Profundis,"Oh, is it, then, Utopian
To hope that I may meet a man
Who’ll not relate, in accents suave,
The tales of girls he used to have?","""I hope that I may meet a manWho’ll not relate, in accents suave,The tales of girls he used to have?"""
Pattern,"Leave me to my lonely pillow.
    Go, and take your silly posies;
Who has vowed to wear the willow
    Looks a fool, tricked out in roses.
Who are you, my lad, to ease me?
    Leave your pretty words unspoken.
Tinkling echoes little please me,
    Now my heart is freshly broken.
Over young are you to guide me,
    And your blood is slow and sleeping.
If you must, then sit beside me....
    Tell me, why have I been weeping?",The poem was written in the early 20th century. It was written by a young man who had lost his wife. The poem is called 'The Loneliness of the Lonely'
Plea,"Secrets, you said, would hold us two apart;
    You’d have me know of you your least transgression
And so the intimate places of your heart,
    Kneeling, you bared to me, as in confession.
Softly you told of loves that went before,—
    Of clinging arms, of kisses gladly given;
Luxuriously clean of heart once more,
    You rose up, then, and stood before me, shriven.
When this, my day of happiness, is through,
    And love, that bloomed so fair, turns brown and brittle,
There is a thing that I shall ask of you—
    I, who have given so much, and asked so little.
Some day, when there’s another in my stead;
    Again you’ll feel the need of absolution,
And you will go to her, and bow your head,
    And offer her your past, as contribution.
When with your list of loves you overcome her,
For Heaven’s sake, keep this one secret from her!","You’d have me know of you your least transgression, you said. Kneeling, you bared to me, as in confession.Softly you told of loves that went before. You rose up, then, and stood before me, shriven."
Comment,"Oh, life is a glorious cycle of song,

Now at Liberty,"Little white love, your way you’ve taken;
    Now I am left alone, alone.
Little white love, my heart’s forsaken.
    (Whom shall I get by telephone?)
Well do I know there’s no returning;
    Once you go out, it’s done, it’s done.
All of my days are gray with yearning.
    (Nevertheless, a girl needs fun.)
Little white love, perplexed and weary,
    Sadly your banner fluttered down.
Sullen the days, and dreary, dreary.
    (Which of the boys is still in town?)
Radiant and sure, you came a-flying;
    Puzzled, you left on lagging feet.
Slow in my breast, my heart is dying.
    (Nevertheless, a girl must eat.)
Little white love, I hailed you gladly;
    Now I must wave you out of sight.
Ah, but you used me badly, badly.
    (Who’d like to take me out tonight?)
All of the blundering words I’ve spoken,
    Little white love, forgive, forgive.
Once you went out, my heart fell, broken.
    (Nevertheless, a girl must live.)",The song was written in the early 1980s. The song is called “Little White Love’s Song” and is written in English and French. The lyrics are written by a group of young women.
Inventory,"Four be the things I am wiser to know:
Idleness, sorrow, a friend, and a foe.
Four be the things I’d been better without:

Three be the things I shall have till I die:
Laughter and hope and a sock in the eye.","Three be the things I shall have till I die:Laughter and hope and a sock in the eye. Four be theThings I am wiser to know:Idleness, sorrow, a friend, and a foe."
Curtain,"Villain shows his indiscretion,

Villain skips, and all are happy.","Hero comforts tearful maiden, Soubrette marries loyal chappie, Villain skips, and all are happy. Villain shows his indiscretion, his partner makes confession."

After the Quarrel,"So we, who've supped the self-same cup,
    To-night must lay our friendship by;
Your wrath has burned your judgment up,
    Hot breath has blown the ashes high.
You say that you are wronged— ah, well,
    I count that friendship poor, at best
A bauble, a mere bagatelle,
    That cannot stand so slight a test.
I fain would still have been your friend,
    And talked and laughed and loved with you;
But since it must, why, let it end;
    The false but dies, 't is not the true.
So we are favored, you and I,
    Who only want the living truth.
It was not good to nurse the lie;
    'Tis well it died in harmless youth.
I go from you to-night to sleep.
    Why, what's the odds? why should I grieve?
I have no fund of tears to weep
    For happenings that undeceive.
The days shall come, the days shall go
    Just as they came and went before.
The sun shall shine, the streams shall flow
    Though you and I are friends no more.
And in the volume of my years,
    Where all my thoughts and acts shall be,
The page whereon your name appears
    Shall be forever sealed to me.
Not that I hate you over-much,
    'Tis less of hate than love defied;
Howe'er, our hands no more shall touch,
    We'll go our ways, the world is wide.","I count that friendship poor, at best. So we, who've supped the self-same cup, must lay our friendship by. The false but dies, 't is not the true."
The Dramatists,"A string of shiny days we had, 
     A spotless sky, a yellow sun; 
And neither you nor I was sad
     When that was through and done. 

But when, one day, a boy comes by 
   And pleads me with your happiest vow, 
“There was a lad I knew—” I'll sigh; 
   “I do not know him now.”

And when another girl shall pass
   And speak a little name I said, 
Then you will say “There was a lass—
   I wonder is she dead.”

And each of us will sigh, and start 
   A-talking of a faded year, 
And lay a hand above a heart, 
   And dry a pretty tear. ","A string of shiny days we had,    a spotless sky, a yellow sun;   Neither you nor I was sad when that was through and done.

Story of Mrs. W,"My garden blossoms pink and white, 
      A place of decorous murmuring
Where I am safe from August night
     And cannot feel the knife of spring. 

And I may walk the pretty place
    Before the curtsying hollyhocks
And laundered daisies, round of face—
    Good little girls, in party frocks. 

My trees are amiably arrayed
    In pattern on the dappled sky, 
And I may sit in filtered shade
    And watch the tidy years go by. 

And I may amble pleasantly 
   And hear my neighbors list their bones
And click my tongue in sympathy, 
   And count the cracks in paving stones. 

My door is grave in oaken strength, 
    The cool of linen calms my bed, 
And there at night I stretch my length
     And envy no one but the dead. ","The author's garden is full of hollyhocks, laundered daisies and party frocks. The garden is a place of decorous murmuring, she writes."
Verse Reporting Late Arrival at a Conclusion,"Consider a lady gone reckless in love,
     In novels and plays:
You watch her proceed in a drapery of
     A roseate haze.
Acclaimed as a riot, a wow, and a scream,
She flies with her beau to les Alpes Maritimes,
And moves in a mist of a mutual dream
     The rest of her days.
In life, if you’ll listen to one who has been
     Observant of such,
A lady in love is more frequently in
     Decidedly Dutch.
The thorn, so to say, is revealed by the rose.
The best that she gets is a sock in the nose.
These authors and playwrights, I’m forced to suppose,
     Don’t get around much.","A lady in love is more frequently in Dutch than English. The thorn, so to say, is revealed by the rose. These authors and playwrights, I’m forced to suppose, don't get around much."
Unfortunate Coincidence,"By the time you swear you’re his,
     Shivering and sighing,
And he vows his passion is
     Infinite, undying—
Lady, make a note of this:
     One of you is lying.","Lady, make a note of this: One of you is lying. By the time you swear you’re his, he vows his passion is Infinite, undying."
Voices of the Air,"But then there comes that moment rare
When, for no cause that I can find,
The little voices of the air
Sound above all the sea and wind.
The sea and wind do then obey
And sighing, sighing double notes
Of double basses, content to play
A droning chord for the little throats—
The little throats that sing and rise
Up into the light with lovely ease
And a kind of magical, sweet surprise
To hear and know themselves for these—
For these little voices: the bee, the fly,
The leaf that taps, the pod that breaks,
The breeze on the grass-tops bending by,
The shrill quick sound that the insect makes.","The sea and wind do then obey. And sighing, sighing double basses play a droning chord for the little throats. It's a kind of magical, sweet surprise to hear and know themselves for these."
Drift,"The gold March dawn
and below my window 
a man carves his car
from the snow heap
plowed up around it.
So easy not to envy
the cold muscled task
but then imagine—
feeling your heartbeat
alive like a chipmunk
at work in your chest,
imagine the whole day
arm-sore and good
with accomplishment,
the day you begin
with heavy breath
and see it linger
outside your body
like a negative of
the dark air cavity

in you like the ghost.",A man carves his car from a snow heap. The gold March dawn. The cold muscled task is easy not to envy. But then imagine feeling your heartbeat like a chipmunk.
The Heedless Shepherd,"Grief is a family going down one by one 
Wild buffalo tread on thin medallions 
It’s a sin to be born poor
It’s treason to stay that way
On the way to work at Fort Hood
Shepherd fell in love with a cherry 
Mother wore a red gingham apron 
While plating macaroni on the base
At home her daughter sat under an eye
That lost her in a blind spot 
Back then work had a weight you could feel it
After the war the father got a son
Quilts are folded like flags in the cupboard 
The morning shepherd left 
We drained a pitcher of cheap wine 
Our ancestors had robbed and been robbed 
And now everything was a mess","Grief is a family going down one by one, says the author. Grief is the loss of a family member, writes the writer. ""It’s a sin to be born poor,"" he says, ""and a treason to stay that way"""

"It Bruises, Too","The haunting has killed before.
Find words to describe the stone
heavy in the bowels. Before us
are the disasters we make
of our lives. I am a clumsy
journeyman. You find me on
a road that curls across green
plains. You see me with my staff
from so many miles away. We follow
the contours the mountains
make of the road until, hours
later, after two light showers
and a burst of sunlight we
meet. I tell you I am doing
penance. I promise that these
words I am speaking are the breaking
of a long fast, and my voice
sounds alien even to me.
You ask why I wince like that.
“The silence,” I say. “It bruises, as well.”
And after the elation of this meeting,
we part, you towards the light, me
into the gloom you left behind.","The haunting has killed before. The silence bruises, as well. The stone is heavy in the bowels. Before us are the disasters we make                of our lives. I promise that these are the breaking words of a long fast."

Song in a Minor Key,"THERE’S a place I know where the birds swing low,

Where the lilacs nod, and a marble god
    Is pale, in scented gloaming.
And at sunset there comes a lady fair
    Whose eyes are deep with yearning.
By an old, old gate does the lady wait
    Her own true love’s returning.
But the days go by, and the lilacs die,
    And trembling birds seek cover;
Yet the lady stands, with her long white hands
    Held out to greet her lover.
And it’s there she’ll stay till the shadowy day

She will always wait by the same old gate,––

Biographies,"                           1.
  NOW this is the story of Lucy Brown,
A glittering jewel in virtue’s crown.
From earliest youth, she aspired to please.
She never fell down and dirtied her knees;
She put all her pennies in savings banks;
She never omitted her “please” and “thanks”;
She swallowed her spinach without a squawk;
And patiently listened to Teacher’s talk;
She thoughtfully stepped over worms and ants;
And earnestly watered the potted plants;
She didn’t disremember expensive toys;
And never would play with the little boys.
And when to young womanhood Lucy came
Her mode of behavior was just the same.
She always was safe in her home at dark;
And never went riding around the park;
She wouldn’t put powder upon her nose;
And petticoats sheltered her spotless hose;
She knew how to market and mend and sweep;
By quarter-past ten, she was sound asleep;
In presence of elders, she held her tongue––
The way that they did when the world was young.
And people remarked, in benign accord,
“You’ll see that she gathers her just reward.”
Observe, their predictions were more than fair.
She married an affluent millionaire
So gallant and handsome and wise and gay,
And rated in Bradstreet at Double A.
And she lived with him happily all her life,
And made him a perfectly elegant wife.
                                     2.
  Now Marigold Jones, from her babyhood,
Was bad as the model Miss Brown was good.
She stuck out her tongue at her grieving nurse;
She frequently rifled her Grandma’s purse;
She banged on the table and broke the plates;
She jeered at the passing inebriates;
And tore all her dresses and ripped her socks;
And shattered the windows with fair-sized rocks;
The words on the fences she’d memorize;
She blackened her dear little brother’s eyes;
And cut off her sister’s abundant curls;
And never would play with the little girls.
And when she grew up––as is hardly strange––
Her manner of life underwent no change
But faithfully followed her childhood plan.
And once there was talk of a married man!
She sauntered in public in draperies
Affording no secrecy to her knees;
She constantly uttered what was not true;
She flirted and petted, or what have you;
And, tendered advice by her kind Mamma,
Her answer, I shudder to state, was “Blah!”
And people remarked, in sepulchral tones,
“You’ll see what becomes of Marigold Jones.”
Observe, their predictions were more than fair.

Pictures in the Smoke,"OH, gallant was the first love, and glittering and fine;

The third love was his, and the fourth was mine;

Inscription for the Ceiling of a Bedroom,"DAILY dawns another day;
I must up, to make my way.
Though I dress and drink and eat,
Move my fingers and my feet,
Learn a little, here and there,
Weep and laugh and sweat and swear,
Hear a song, or watch a stage,
Leave some words upon a page,
Claim a foe, or hail a friend––
Bed awaits me at the end.
Though I go in pride and strength,
I’ll come back to bed at length.
Though I walk in blinded woe,
Back to bed I’m bound to go.
High my heart, or bowed my head,
All my days but lead to bed.
Up, and out, and on; and then
Ever back to bed again,
Summer, Winter, Spring, and Fall––
I’m a fool to rise at all!","The poet writes of his daily routine. He says: ""I must up, to make my way. Though I dress and drink and eat, I must go back to bed at length"""
General Review of the Sex Situation,"WOMAN wants monogamy;
Man delights in novelty.

Ballade of Big Plans,"She loved him. He knew it. And love was a game that two

ONCE the orioles sang in chorus,
Once the skies were a cloudless blue.
Spring bore blossoms expressly for us,
Stars lined up to spell “Y-O-U.”
All the world wore a golden hue,
Life was a thing to be bold and gay at;
Love was the only game I knew,
And love is a game that two can play at.
Now the heavens are scowling o’er us,
Now the blossoms are pale and few.
Love was a rose with thorns that tore us,
Love was a ship without a crew.
Love is untender, and love is untrue,
Love is a moon for a dog to bay at,
Love is the Lady-That’s-Known-as-Lou,
And love is a game that two can play at.
Recollections can only bore us;
Now it’s over, and now it’s through.
Our day is dead as a dinosaurus.

The Choice,"HE’D have given me rolling lands,
       Houses of marble, and billowing farms,
Pearls, to trickle between my hands,
   Smoldering rubies, to circle my arms.
You––you’d only a lilting song,
   Only a melody, happy and high,
You were sudden and swift and strong,––
   Never a thought for another had I.
He’d have given me laces rare,
   Dresses that glimmered with frosty sheen,
Shining ribbons to wrap my hair,
   Horses to draw me, as fine as a queen.

Rondeau Redoublé,"(AND SCARCELY WORTH THE TROUBLE, AT THAT)
THE same to me are sombre days and gay.
      Though joyous dawns the rosy morn, and bright,
Because my dearest love is gone away
    Within my heart is melancholy night.
My heart beats low in loneliness, despite
    That riotous Summer holds the earth in sway.
In cerements my spirit is bedight;
    The same to me are sombre days and gay.
Though breezes in the rippling grasses play,
    And waves dash high and far in glorious might,
I thrill no longer to the sparkling day,
    Though joyous dawns the rosy morn, and bright.
Ungraceful seems to me the swallow’s flight;
    As well might Heaven’s blue be sullen gray;
My soul discerns no beauty in their sight
    Because my dearest love is gone away.
Let roses fling afar their crimson spray,
    And virgin daisies splash the fields with white,
Let bloom the poppy hotly as it may,
    Within my heart is melancholy night.
And this, oh love, my pitiable plight
    Whenever from my circling arms you stray;
This little world of mine has lost its light. . . .
    I hope to God, my dear, that you can say
                                                    The same to me.",The same to me are sombre days and gay. My heart beats low in loneliness. That riotous Summer holds the earth in sway. My soul discerns no beauty in their sight.
Fighting Words,"SAY my love is easy had,
      Say I’m bitten raw with pride,
Say I am too often sad,––
   Still behold me at your side.
Say I’m neither brave nor young,
   Say I woo and coddle care,
Say the devil touched my tongue,––
   Still you have my heart to wear.
But say my verses do not scan,
   And I get me another man!","Say I’m bitten raw with pride, say I am too often sad, say the devil touched my tongue. Say I woo and coddle care. Still you have my heart to wear."
Symptom Recital,"I DO not like my state of mind;
I’m bitter, querulous, unkind.
I hate my legs, I hate my hands,
I do not yearn for lovelier lands.
I dread the dawn’s recurrent light;
I hate to go to bed at night.
I snoot at simple, earnest folk.
I cannot take the gentlest joke.
I find no peace in paint or type.
My world is but a lot of tripe.
I’m disillusioned, empty-breasted.
For what I think, I’d be arrested.
I am not sick, I am not well.
My quondam dreams are shot to hell.
My soul is crushed, my spirit sore;
I do not like me any more.
I cavil, quarrel, grumble, grouse.
I ponder on the narrow house.
I shudder at the thought of men. . . .
I’m due to fall in love again.","I’m bitter, querulous, unkind. I hate to go to bed at night. I snoot at simple, earnest folk. I find no peace in paint or type or type. My world is but a lot of tripe."
Observation,"If I don’t drive around the park,
I’m pretty sure to make my mark.
If I’m in bed each night by ten,
I may get back my looks again,
If I abstain from fun and such,
I’ll probably amount to much,
But I shall stay the way I am,
Because I do not give a damn.","If I don’t drive around the park, I’m pretty sure to make my mark. If I abstain from fun and such,I’ll probably amount to much. But I shall stay the way I am,Because I do not give a damn."
Religion,"I am no priest of crooks nor creeds,
For human wants and human needs
Are more to me than prophets' deeds;
And human tears and human cares
Affect me more than human prayers.
Go, cease your wail, lugubrious saint!
You fret high Heaven with your plaint.
Is this the ""Christian's joy"" you paint?
Is this the Christian's boasted bliss?
Avails your faith no more than this?
Take up your arms, come out with me,
Let Heav'n alone; humanity
Needs more and Heaven less from thee.
With pity for mankind look 'round;
Help them to rise—and Heaven is found.","I am no priest of crooks nor creeds, for human wants and human needs are more to me than prophets' deeds. Human tears and human cares Affect me more than human prayers.Go, cease your wail, lugubrious saint!"
Conscience and Remorse,"""Good-bye,"" I said to my conscience—
    ""Good-bye for aye and aye,""
And I put her hands off harshly,
    And turned my face away;
And conscience smitten sorely
    Returned not from that day.
But a time came when my spirit
    Grew weary of its pace;
And I cried: ""Come back, my conscience;
    I long to see thy face.""
But conscience cried: ""I cannot;
    Remorse sits in my place.""","""Good-bye for aye and aye,"" I said to my conscience. But conscience cried: ""I cannot; Remorse sits in my place"""
The Lover And The Moon,"A lover whom duty called over the wave,
With himself communed: ""Will my love be true
If left to herself? Had I better not sue
Some friend to watch over her, good and grave?
But my friend might fail in my need,"" he said,
""And I return to find love dead.
Since friendships fade like the flow'rs of June,
I will leave her in charge of the stable moon.""

Then he said to the moon: ""O dear old moon,
Who for years and years from thy throne above
Hast nurtured and guarded young lovers and love,
My heart has but come to its waiting June,
And the promise time of the budding vine;
Oh, guard thee well this love of mine.""
And he harked him then while all was still,
And the pale moon answered and said, 'I will.'

And he sailed in his ship o'er many seas,
And he wandered wide o'er strange far strands:
in isles of the south and in Orient lands,
Where pestilence lurks in the breath of the breeze.
But his star was high, so he braved the main,
And sailed him blithely home again;
And with joy he bended his footsteps soon
To learn of his love from the matron moon.

She sat as of yore, in her olden place,
Serene as death, in her silver chair.
A white rose gleamed in her whiter hair,
And the tint of a blush was on her face.
At sight of the youth she sadly bowed
And hid her face 'neath a gracious cloud.
She faltered faint on the night's dim marge,
But ""How,"" spoke the youth, ""have you kept your charge?""

The moon was sad at a trust ill-kept;
The blush went out in her blanching cheek,
And her voice was timid and low and weak,
As she made her plea and sighed and wept.
'Oh, another prayed and another plead,
And I couldn't resist,"" she answering said;
""But love still grows in the hearts of men:
Go forth, dear youth, and love again.""

But he turned him away from her proffered grace.
""Thou art false, O moon, as the hearts of men,
I will not, will not love again.""
And he turned sheer 'round with a soul-sick face
To the sea, and cried: ""Sea, curse the moon,
Who makes her vows and forgets so soon.""
And the awful sea with anger stirred,
And his breast heaved hard as he lay and heard.

And ever the moon wept down in rain,
And ever her sighs rose high in wind;
But the earth and sea were deaf and blind,
And she wept and sighed her griefs in vain.
And ever at night, when the storm is fierce,
The cries of a wraith through the thunders pierce;
And the waves strain their awful hands on high
To tear the false moon from the sky.","A lover whom duty called over the wave, with himself communed: ""Will my love be true? Had I better not sue some friend to watch over her, good and grave?"" He said to the moon: ""O dear old moon, who for years and years nurtured and guarded young lovers and love, my heart has but come to its waiting June, the promise time of the budding vine"" And the pale moon answered and said, 'I will.'"
Empty,"I don’t want to see

My Memories Live in my Mother’s Phone,"Her dress shimmered tiny pink and green flower gardens
like a tablecloth in a rural twentieth century 
American farmhouse, something tender
you never saw since you were a child too,
pleats and folds along the bodice,
tucks and stitchery made with a patience
that barely abides anymore, her hair tightly braided
and coiled in circles against her perfect head
with tiny red ribbons at elegant intervals,
but when you said, Memories, her face fell.
She whispered, we left them, we had to 
leave everything in our house, 
my cabinet, my doll, my books,
my pepper plant, my pillow.
Nothing now we knew before.
But we have a few pictures.
My memories live in my mother’s phone. 
 ","Her dress shimmered tiny pink and green flower gardens, like a tablecloth in a rural twentieth century farmhouse. Her hair tightly braided and coiled in circles against her perfect head, with tiny red ribbons at elegant intervals."
What She Said,"A woman on a plane said No!
We didn’t want your bombs 
and guns. We didn’t want them 
setting up camps
making secret plans
crisscrossing our mountains
dressed in combat gear.
Those helicopters scared us.
We wanted girls in school, yes,
freedom for women, always,
how can there not be freedom
for the source of life?
But more war, battles, 
years of dead villagers 
sprawled under 
pine nut trees, why?
Why not simpler things,
more schools,
larger hospitals,
food?
There would have been
Better things to do. 
 ","We didn’t want your bombs and guns. We wanted girls in school, yes. But more war, battles, years of dead villagers. Why not simpler things?"
Green Shirt,"His mother did not wash it for this, 
for him to be carried dead by two friends
across the thirsty ground of Gaza.
That morning he put it on, she told him
he looked handsome, a fine deep color
for an unfolding day.

To Louise,"Oh, the poets may sing of their Lady Irenes,
And may rave in their rhymes about wonderful queens;
But I throw my poetical wings to the breeze,
And soar in a song to my Lady Louise.
A sweet little maid, who is dearer, I ween,
Than any fair duchess, or even a queen.
When speaking of her I can't plod in my prose,
For she's the wee lassie who gave me a rose.
Since poets, from seeing a lady's lip curled,
Have written fair verse that has sweetened the world;
Why, then, should not I give the space of an hour
To making a song in return for a flower?
I have found in my life—it has not been so long—
There are too few of flowers—too little of song.
So out of that blossom, this lay of mine grows,
For the dear little lady who gave me the rose.
I thank God for innocence, dearer than Art,
That lights on a by-way which leads to the heart,
And led by an impulse no less than divine,
Walks into the temple and sits at the shrine.
I would rather pluck daisies that grow in the wild,
Or take one simple rose from the hand of a child,
Than to breathe the rich fragrance of flowers that bide
In the gardens of luxury, passion, and pride.
I know not, my wee one, how came you to know
Which way to my heart was the right way to go;
Unless in your purity, soul-clean and clear,
God whispers his messages into your ear.
You have now had my song, let me end with a prayer
That your life may be always sweet, happy, and fair;
That your joys may be many, and absent your woes,
O dear little lady who gave me the rose!","The poet wrote a song in memory of a woman who gave him a rose. The song is called ""A Sweet Little Maid"" and is written in praise of Lady Louise."
Spring Song,"A blue-bell springs upon the ledge,
A lark sits singing in the hedge;
Sweet perfumes scent the balmy air,
And life is brimming everywhere.
What lark and breeze and bluebird sing,
    Is Spring, Spring, Spring!
No more the air is sharp and cold;
The planter wends across the wold,
And, glad, beneath the shining sky
We wander forth, my love and I.
And ever in our hearts doth ring
    This song of Spring, Spring!
For life is life and love is love,
'Twixt maid and man or dove and dove.
Life may be short, life may be long,
But love will come, and to its song
Shall this refrain for ever cling
    Of Spring, Spring, Spring!","""Spring, Spring, Spring"" is one of the most popular songs of the 20th century. The song was written by the English poet and poet-in-residence, William Makepeace Thackeray. It is set to music and was written in the early 1960s."
Shadow,"Silhouette
On the face of the moon
Am I.
A dark shadow in the light.
A silhouette am I
On the face of the moon
Lacking color
Or vivid brightness
But defined all the clearer
Because
I am dark,
Black on the face of the moon.
A shadow am I
Growing in the light,
Not understood
As is the day,
But more easily seen
Because
I am a shadow in the light.","Because I am dark,                Black on the face of the moon.                A shadow am I                Growing in the light,                Not understood                As is the day,                But more easily seen than the day.                Because I. am a shadow in the the light."
"The Sun, Mad Envious, Just Wants the Moon","out of the way. It knows that I tend to cling
to potential in the dark, that I am myself only
as I am beguiled by the moon’s lunatic luster,
when the streets are so bare they grow voices.
The sun has lost patience with my craving
for the night’s mass-produced romance, that
dog-eared story where every angle is exquisite,
and ghostly suitors, their sleek smells exploding,
queue up to ravish my waning. Bursting with
bluster, the sun backslaps the moon to reveal
me, splintered, kissing the boulevard face first,
clutching change for a jukebox that long ago
lost its hunger for quarters. It wounds the sun
to know how utterly I have slipped its gilded
clutch to become its most mapless lost cause.
Her eye bulging, she besieges me with bright.
So I remind her that everything dies. All the
brilliant bitch can do for me then is spit light
on the path while I search for a place to sleep.","The sun has lost patience with my craving for the night’s mass-produced romance. It knows that I tend to cling to potential in the dark, that I am myself only                as I am beguiled by the moon's lunatic luster."
God Could Not Make Her a Poet,"Thomas Jefferson said this, more or less,
After he read the musings of the clever African
Phillis Wheatley, a sensation of both the Colonies
And England, a black patriot, though a slave.
Whatever a black hand can build, he knew,
Could only be guided by a master’s vision,
Like this room of the mansion he probably
Wrote his opinion in—what black mind could
Dream in these proportions? And gather
The slope of these Virginia hills so lovingly
To his window? God could give her words,
But the subtle turn? Like giving a gull
A sack of gold.","Thomas Jefferson said this, more or less, after he read the musings of the clever African Phillis Wheatley. Whatever a black hand can build, he knew, could only be guided by a master's vision."
Midnight Air in Louisville,"for Breonna Taylor
Dear Breonna,
How many times, I ask,
           how many times
have I chased the thought
                      of writing to you,
of catching the poem where
                      it cannot leave,
of knocking open the door to a grief
           we all hold, our hearts
full of questions.
           We leave our houses to work,
to look for what we need to live,
                      or what we need
           to make the pain go away,
and your voice rises:
           “Oh hell to the no,
no he didn’t,
           Satan get behind me,
whatever, whatever
           the hell you think you are.”
I imagine that in leaving 
all of us you said:
           “I am done
I am let out into the world,
           breath I took in from it
breath that I give back in love.”
May I see you in flight
filling the space
           beyond clouds and stars
where there is no need
           of sun or moon, where
a grand city lives
           in prophecies beaten
by the wheels of history
where you are not invisible
           to ancestors who saw
these long roads down through time
to this one night in Louisville.

My Dead Friends,"My friends are dead who were
the arches    the pillars of my life 
the structural relief when
the world gave none.
  My friends who knew me as I knew them
their bodies folded into the ground or burnt to ash.

might I lift my life as a turtle carries her home?  
  Who if I cried out would hear me?

All the Time Blues Villanelle,"Hard to watch somebody lose their mind
Maybe everybody    should just go get stoned
My father said it happens all the time
I knew a woman    lost her to soul to wine
But who doesn’t live with their life on loan?
Shame to watch somebody lose their mind
Don’tchu gotta wonder when people say they’re fine?
Given what we’re given, I guess they actin grown
I think I used to say that      all the time
When my parents died, I coined a little shrine
And thought about all the stuff they used to own
Felt like I was gonna lose my mind
Used to have a friend    who smiled all the time
Then he started sayin he could hear the devil moan
Hate to see a brotha lose his gotdam mind
Doesn’t matter how you pull, the hours break the line
Mirror, Mirror on the wall, how come nobody’s home?
Broke my soul for real, when my mother lost her mind
Tried to keep my head right, but sanity’s a climb
Been workin on the straight face—I guess my cover’s blown
My father tried to tell me     all the time
Had one last question, baby, but maybe never mind
After’while, even springtime starts to drone

We Pulled a Rose in Summer Time,"We pulled a rose in summer time
        Beside True Lover’s Gate,
Our lips sent up so sweet a chime,
        That twilight lingered late;
Now look how is the year grown old!—
        How leafless hedge and tree,—
’Tis said that even love grows cold,
        So here is rosemary.",The author and his wife wrote about their love for a rosemary. The couple's love for rosemary was inspired by a trip to a rose garden in the summer.
My Aunt’s Angels,"They knock on cupboards & ribs,
steal mothballs from the wardrobe’s dim corners
& patch them into their wings.
They scream when the kettle boils.
Their feet & fingers are webbed like geese.
Some bake bran muffins in blue children’s aprons.
The kitchen, powdered in bread flour, a cloud they glide through.
Others wrestle the wind through a screen door.
When the doorbell rings, they flap their arms & chirp
their mockingbird throats.
They work in shifts, all night shining shoes.
All morning they brush her hair.
Some are secretive & break the chimes, so she won’t
know their comings & goings.
Others dissect the basement mice & pin
the decorative bodies, splayed like fans, to the walls.
Their laughter rakes like tires screeching through a stop.
She begs them to stop but they only start a game
of tar & feathers.
She opens the door to leave, but more trudge in
ferrying beer bottles & shoehorns, tiny mouse bones dangling
from their teeth.
Some plant violets in the garden then wash their feet
so the dirt won’t track in. Or so the violets won’t grow
inside. Some rock her to bed & call her baby;
others roll their doll eyes & bite her fingernails to shards as she sleeps.
She once woke to a fistful of blood & feathers, believing
it a tiny bird she’d crushed in sleep.
Tomorrow, she will take a pill & they will leave in a mournful parade:
When angels leave us, they look like lost children.
She will spend all day counting their shadows like stitches
& washing that dead bird from her fingers’ webs.","They knock on cupboards & ribs, steal mothballs from the wardrobe’s dim corners & patch them into their wings.

Palms.,"i.
I miss the rev of the minivan.
The time I turned too sharp off Harlem and dug
its battered side into a white van.
The tobacco glued to the man’s teeth as he yelled
and then realized that a minivan could do no harm
to his white van.
I miss pleading to my mother for the keys or slipping them
into my pocket, depending on the furrow of her brow.
And how I would drive the car until the red arrow just graced E
and then vacate for a week until the tank magically filled itself.
ii.
Driving at night is mostly like soaring,
like a pair of ice skates and the whole town,
your whole world, is frozen over. I’m always finding excuses
to run errands in the moon’s embrace, to slip
down the driveway into brake lights and exhaust pipes.
I know neon Jewel Osco like I know my own knuckles.
The checkout lady, a cool breeze as she makes up
a family for me and wonders why they let me go out every night,
for dish soap, tampons, a thank you card,
wonders why shopping has become my good-night kiss.
Sometimes I will take Harlem Ave. so far
that cross streets become strangers and I wonder if I say
hello enough times the world won’t feel so much
like a vengeful tongue.
iii.
I do not drive in Boston,
I take the train, the slow chug of the city’s arteries.
I step onto Comm Ave. after a car passes,
jacket blown open wide.
I remember the thrill of a sterling wheel
and a half an hour in which no one will call your name.
I daydream about Thanksgiving break
when I can shiver in the front seat,
puff clouds of smoke with the car as it awakes,
used to slumbering in its old age.
I will take the car down Harlem Ave.,
past Roosevelt Rd. where all the cross streets
turn to numbers and I will count on my fingers
the hours until I leave.","I miss pleading to my mother for the keys or slipping them into my pocket, depending on the furrow of her brow.

No Images,"She does not know
Her beauty,
She thinks her brown body
Has no glory.

Under palm trees
And see her image in the river

And dish water gives back no images.","She does not know her beauty, she thinks her brown body has no glory. If she could dance, she would know. But there are no palm trees on the street, and dish water gives back no images."
The Flea,"“The flea,” that’s what the year-rounders call it,
rummaging through tools or bric-a-brac then
gossiping all day at their tables in the blistering sun,
their faded beach umbrellas barely shading the tarmac.
This is what my mother did in New Hampshire
Sunday after widowed Sunday, into her eighties.
Up at dawn, her wagon packed the night before—
by noon, willing to mark down anything not to have
to re-wrap and pack the whole kit and caboodle
for the sticky hundred mile drive home ….
Today, I pick up a teapot, white with a smattering
of pink and black and aqua stars, its flawed glaze
(a reject from the start), its jaunty asterisks,
its moderne form, manufactured in Syracuse
in the ’Fifties, pleases me, seven starry cups
and five chipped star-studded dinner plates—
ordinary optimistic dishes, probably used by one
Cape Cod family for decades, only dings
and cracks now to tell their homely provenance,
their good usage and keep the price down.
Not star-struck, my mother would have felt
the edges’ roughness with her thumb and found
them wanting. It wouldn’t have been the chips—
she treasured her miniatures, her broken “minnies”—
these just weren’t her thing. But like a ninny—
I can make something of this, can’t I?—I buy the lot
in her magpie memory, wrapped in old Globes,
for what a cappuccino would cost, or a Parisian mystery. ","The author's mother was a flea hunter in New Hampshire.

Who Does This Feeling Belong To?,"I am nearly positive there are no other

Oak Park Mutters Statistics,"A website stutters numbers
about my town sheepishly
pushing them all the way
to the bottom
The percentage of residents living in poverty—8.5%
Then the parentheses:
(6% for white residents)
(9.6% for Hispanic residents)
(14.3% for Black residents)
I wonder why it is only the poverty statistic
that mentions race

other ways to get to work

and saw Black bodies

children have done anything
other than cast problems under bottom lips
letting injustice sit with stale breath
Their “hate has no home here” lawn signs
resting in freshly trimmed grass
I can feel them eyeing me
questioning if I belong here
as I walk past
I think about pulling all the signs out
Telling my neighbors to learn their own statistics
Will they see me in parentheses?
A part of me hopes they don‘t
Is this why I straighten my hair
for every school picture?

a teacher may see me as something
other than Latina
Is Oak Park the cut lawn
and the sign planted in it
or white women
standing proud behind their liberal yard signs?

on anything but the problems across the street?

it will say it without muttering",In this cushy suburb racial bias loves to glare back at you from the inside of a wallet.

Standing by a Shelf,"for Reuben
When he looks at the edges,
The covers of books and records,
He remembers when and where
He got them, how it felt.
Everything’s a testament
To life lived on the fringe
Of some sense of sanity.
All the vehicles for imbibing
These treasures are obsolete.
Even his eyes and ears, as their
Function fades under each year’s
Mud and tussle to stay alive
The damned fine few who know
Try not to lose the memories,
Talk as if each was there
For the other, laughter supplants tears.
If he can, a story gets written
About each song, how a chord
A lyric, the last line of a book
Make more sense, the same as the
Warnings his mother threw
at fledgling feet like seeds in soil.
He wishes he could buy them all again,
Heed the messages, grow as if
Each signpost was a vitamin
Make what became a recollection
A catalyst for pathfinding and strength.","Reuben is a young man who lives on the fringe of sanity. He looks at the edges of books and records and remembers when and where he got them, how it felt. He wishes he could buy them all again."
Why So This Quiet,"            Dog lifts his leg to piss on the bull briar; pisses;
and up from the twists and thorns flies a ghost moth,
two of them, three, moving like an abandoned
but still persuasive, still shifting argument,
            until as usual they move how they move, even as
the field’s edge means the edge of the field, not
the shadow-stitched perimeter of childhood

“A whip is not a lasso,” losing patience,
while someone else strikes a match, sets fire

Late Afternoon Stroll on the Cliffs,"As usual, Death sweetly slips her arm in mine—
& we take a deep breath from the eucalyptus breeze.
We both worked honestly at our jobs: all day Death
destroyed traffic with wailing ambulances while I killed
hours & lines on eight-&-a-half by eleven inch pages.
We’re fast friends by now, Death much older of course,
but there’s no hierarchy between us: we’re both taking
a break from it all, glad to watch waves collapse on rocks
& pelicans dive-bomb fish. I try to be sensitive to Death’s
guilt: that whole pandemic disaster she can no longer
control. She’ll soon betray me too—like she will you. 
I know. But today the gulls are silver angels etching
great cursive blessings in a perfect sky—so Death & I
make believe we believe that, & amble on.","Death & I are fast friends by now, Death much older of course, but there’s no hierarchy between us: we’re both taking a break from it all, glad to watch waves collapse on rocks.

Crossing the Line,"for Maria
Sitting across the table from you
I think back to when our friendship
came down from the mountains.
It was a cold day and the miners
had not left for work.
  You break a cookie in half like bread
and this sharing is what we both now need.
That which breaks into crumbs are memories.
Your gray hair cut short and you ask if I notice.
  How can I tell you that Bolivia will always be
beautiful and everything I notice is you
and yes is you. Our napkins folded in our hands.
Folded as if our meeting now is prayer.
  Did I ever tell you that your eyes are a map
and I would lose myself if you ever turned away","Maria writes about her friendship with the miners in Bolivia. She says she would lose herself if she ever turned away from her friend. She writes: ""Everything I notice is you"""
Pierrot,"I work all day,
Said Simple John,
Myself a house to buy.
I work all day,
Said Simple John,
But Pierrot wondered why.
For Pierrot loved the long white road,
And Pierrot loved the moon,
And Pierrot loved a star-filled sky,
And the breath of a rose in June.
I have one wife,
Said Simple John,
And, faith, I love her yet.
I have one wife,
Said Simple John,
But Pierrot left Pierrette.
For Pierrot saw a world of girls,
And Pierrot loved each one,
And Pierrot thought all maidens fair
As flowers in the sun.
Oh, I am good,
Said Simple John,
The Lord will take me in.
Yes, I am good,
Said Simple John,
But Pierrot's steeped in sin.
For Pierrot played on a slim guitar,
And Pierrot loved the moon,
And Pierrot ran down the long white road
With the burgher’s wife one June.","Pierrot loved the long white road, and the moon, and a star-filled sky. Pierrot thought all maidens fair as flowers in the sun. But Pierrot left Pierrette."

Unexpressed,"Deep in my heart that aches with the repression,
    And strives with plenitude of bitter pain,
There lives a thought that clamors for expression,
    And spends its undelivered force in vain.

What boots it that some other may have thought it?
    The right of thoughts’ expression is divine;
The price of pain I pay for it has bought it,
    I care not who lays claim to it —‘t is mine!

And yet not mine until it be delivered;
    The manner of its birth shall prove the test.
Alas, alas, my rock of pride is shivered—
    I beat my brow—the thought still unexpressed.","There lives a thought that clamors for expression, and spends its undelivered force in vain. The right of thoughts’ expression is divine; the price of pain I pay for it has bought it."

Retrospection,"When you and I were young, the days
    Were filled with scent of pink and rose,
    And full of joy from dawn till close,
From morning’s mist till evening’s haze.
    And when the robin sung his song
    The verdant woodland ways along,
      We whistled louder than he sung.
And school was joy, and work was sport
For which the hours were all too short,
    When you and I were young, my boy,
      When you and I were young.
When you and I were young, the woods
    Brimmed bravely o’er with every joy
    To charm the happy-hearted boy.
The quail turned out her timid broods;
    The prickly copse, a hostess fine,
    Held high black cups of harmless wine;
      And low the laden grape-vine swung
With beads of night-kissed amethyst
Where buzzing lovers held their tryst,
    When you and I were young, my boy,
      When you and I were young.
When you and I were young, the cool
    And fresh wind fanned our fevered brows
    When tumbling o'er the scented mows,
Or stripping by the dimpling pool,
    Sedge-fringed about its shimmering face,
    Save where we'd worn an ent'ring place.
      How with our shouts the calm banks rung!
How flashed the spray as we plunged in,—
Pure gems that never caused a sin!
    When you and I were young, my boy,
      When you and I were young.
When you and I were young, we heard
    All sounds of Nature with delight,—
    The whirr of wing in sudden flight,
The chirping of the baby-bird.
    The columbine’s red bells were rung;
    The locust’s vested chorus sung;
      While every wind his zithern strung
To high and holy-sounding keys,
And played sonatas in the trees—
    When you and I were young, my boy,
      When you and I were young.
When you and I were young, we knew
    To shout and laugh, to work and play,
    And night was partner to the day
In all our joys. So swift time flew
    On silent wings that, ere we wist,
    The fleeting years had fled unmissed;
      And from our hearts this cry was wrung—
To fill with fond regret and tears
The days of our remaining years—
    ""When you and I were young, my boy,
      When you and I were young.""","When you and I were young, the days were filled with scent of pink and rose, and full of joy from dawn till close. When the robin sung his song, we whistled louder than he sung, and school was joy, and work was sport."
[The whale already],"a golden shovel
The whale already taken got away: the moon alone
—Yosa Buson, translated by Hiroaki Sato
What is endangered, the
rest of us ignore. The whale,
loved by children and cartoonists, already
dwindles. Bycatch has taken
them. The tiny creatures they consume haven’t got
a chance to outlast the warming. A way
to safeguard whales is to deny ourselves the
discs and car exhaust. The moon
sees us at all cost alone.","Yosa Buson: What is endangered, the rest of us ignore. The whale already taken got away: the moon alone. A way to safeguard whales is to deny ourselves thediscs and car exhaust."

Ode for Memorial Day,"Done are the toils and the wearisome marches,
    Done is the summons of bugle and drum.
Softly and sweetly the sky overarches,
    Shelt’ring a land where Rebellion is dumb.
Dark were the days of the country’s derangement,
    Sad were the hours when the conflict was on,
But through the gloom of fraternal estrangement
    God sent his light, and we welcome the dawn.
O’er the expanse of our mighty dominions,
    Sweeping away to the uttermost parts,
Peace, the wide-flying, on untiring pinions,
    Bringeth her message of joy to our hearts.
Ah, but this joy which our minds cannot measure,
    What did it cost for our fathers to gain!
Bought at the price of the heart’s dearest treasure,
    Born out of travail and sorrow and pain;
Born in the battle where fleet Death was flying,
    Slaying with sabre-stroke bloody and fell;
Born where the heroes and martyrs were dying,
    Torn by the fury of bullet and shell.
Ah, but the day is past: silent the rattle,
    And the confusion that followed the fight.
Peace to the heroes who died in the battle,
    Martyrs to truth and the crowning of Right!
Out of the blood of a conflict fraternal,
    Out of the dust and the dimness of death,
Burst into blossoms of glory eternal
    Flowers that sweeten the world with their breath.
Flowers of charity, peace, and devotion
    Bloom in the hearts that are empty of strife;
Love that is boundless and broad as the ocean
    Leaps into beauty and fullness of life.
So, with the singing of paeans and chorals,
    And with the flag flashing high in the sun,
Place on the graves of our heroes the laurels
    Which their unfaltering valor has won!","The Battle of the Bulge was fought between the army and the pro-independence movement in the early 1990s. The battle was one of the bloodiest in the history of the country, with thousands of people killed."
There are no kings in America,"we are not that kind of country.
We are sanctuary for the hungry,
the homeless, the huddled,
held together by an idea
our immigrant fathers believed in.
Rendered, it meant independence.
Pursued, it kindled war, ordinance,
a fighting chance. Forty thousand
musket balls, by themselves, did not
shape the boundaries on which we
map our days. To draw our borders,
we needed more than firecakes.
More than a pound of meat
with bone and gristle,
or salt fish and a gill of peas.
We needed the faith and grit of people
who were not yet Americans.
To be an American is to
recognize the sacrifice
of the widow and the orphan;
it is to understand the weft of tent
cities expecting caravans,
and the heft of a child in a camp
not meant for children, or sitting
before a judge awaiting judgement.
What do we say to the native
whose lands we now inhabit?
What do we say to our immigrant
fathers who held certain truths
to be self-evident?
Do we now still pledge to each
other our lives, our fortunes,
our sacred honor.
There are no kings in America.
Only gilded men we can topple
again and again.","We are sanctuary for the hungry, the homeless, the huddled, held together by an idea our immigrant fathers believed in. Forty thousandmusket balls, by themselves, did not shape the boundaries on which we                map our days."
Shadowless Shadow,"The Great Matriarch says: There is a dog who barks at his own shadow, which is not there, for in mid-day sun, there is no shadow.
Notice, if I give him a dumpling or a chew-toy, he stops barking, but he does not stop when he sees his shadowless shadow. He barks with warning, with alarm.
He barks louder and louder, snapping his jaws, swallowing sputum, on his haunches, ready to pounce.
He is afraid of what is not there. Like you, Mei Ling, when you wake up, gasping for breath, thinking you might die, that ICE agents will come with a choke-chain.
Poor dear, he wants to protect us from the unseen, the unexpected, the unknowable. This is very bad luck in the neighborhood, to constantly hear the harbinger of doom.
Should we, then, euthanize him, put him out of his misery? To prophesy destruction is to invite bad omens, to stare into the abyss.
Or should we calm him, caress him, give him shelter?
Let’s call him by his birth name and take away his power. Let’s shout, “Hashtag, No Collusion, Gunboat, Death Star, Apocalypse, Mara, Cerberus, Beelzebub!”
Let’s call him, “The one who understands vacuity.”
Let’s not fear him, but love him, offer the pink leash, for he is your dog and he is mine.","The Great Matriarch says: There is a dog who barks at his own shadow, which is not there. This is very bad luck in the neighborhood, to constantly hear the harbinger of doom."
I Come From A Place So Deep Inside America It Can't Be Seen,"White oaks thrash, moonlight drifts
the ceiling, as if I'm under water.
Propane coils, warms my bones.
Gone are the magics and songs,
all the things our grandmothers buried—
piles of feathers and angel bones,
inscribed by all who came before.
When I was twelve, my cousins
called me ugly, enough to make it last.
Tonight a celebrity on Oprah
imagines a future where features
can be removed and replaced
on a whim. A moth presses wings
thin as paper against my window,
more beautiful than I could ever be.
Ryegrass raise seedy heads
beyond the bull thistle and preen.
Everything alive aches for more.","Tonight a celebrity on Oprah imagines a future where features can be removed and replaced. A moth presses wings thin as paper against my window, more beautiful than I could ever be."
What’s Broken,"The slate black sky. The middle step
of the back porch. And long ago
my mother’s necklace, the beads
rolling north and south. Broken
the rose stem, water into drops, glass
knobs on the bedroom door. Last summer’s
pot of parsley and mint, white roots
shooting like streamers through the cracks.
Years ago the cat’s tail, the bird bath,
the car hood’s rusted latch. Broken
little finger on my right hand at birth—
I was pulled out too fast. What hasn’t
been rent, divided, split? Broken
the days into nights, the night sky
into stars, the stars into patterns
I make up as I trace them
with a broken-off blade
of grass. Possible, unthinkable,
the cricket’s tiny back as I lie
on the lawn in the dark, my heart
a blue cup fallen from someone’s hands.","The writer recalls the broken things in her life. The slate black sky, the cat's tail, the bird bath, the car hood's rusted latch."
The Jester,"In one hand
I hold tragedy
And in the other
Comedy,—
Masks for the soul.
Laugh with me.
You would laugh!
Weep with me
You would weep!
Tears are my laughter.
Laughter is my pain.
Cry at my grinning mouth,
If you will.
Laugh at my sorrow’s reign.
I am the Black Jester,
The dumb clown of the world,
The booted, booted fool of silly men.
Once I was wise.
Shall I be wise again?","The Black Jester is the dumb clown of the world, the booted, booted fool of silly men. He holds tragedy in one hand and comedy in the other. He asks: ""Shall I be wise again?"""
The South,"The lazy, laughing South
With blood on its mouth.
The sunny-faced South,
     Beast-strong,
     Idiot-brained.
The child-minded South
Scratching in the dead fire’s ashes
For a Negro’s bones.
     Cotton and the moon,
     Warmth, earth, warmth,
     The sky, the sun, the stars,
     The magnolia-scented South.
Beautiful, like a woman,
Seductive as a dark-eyed whore,
     Passionate, cruel,
     Honey-lipped, syphilitic—
     That is the South.
And I, who am black, would love her
But she spits in my face.
And I, who am black,
Would give her many rare gifts
But she turns her back upon me.
     So now I seek the North—
     The cold-faced North,
     For she, they say,
     Is a kinder mistress,
And in her house my children
May escape the spell of the South.","The South is a land of cotton, the moon, the sky, the sun, the stars, and the magnolia-scented South. But the South is also cruel, vicious, syphilitic and lazy."
Aunt Sue’s Stories,"Aunt Sue has a head full of stories.
Aunt Sue has a whole heart full of stories.
Summer nights on the front porch
Aunt Sue cuddles a brown-faced child to her bosom
And tells him stories.
Black slaves
Working in the hot sun,
And black slaves
Walking in the dewy night,
And black slaves
Singing sorrow songs on the banks of a mighty river
Mingle themselves softly
In the flow of old Aunt Sue's voice,
Mingle themselves softly
In the dark shadows that cross and recross
Aunt Sue's stories.
And the dark-faced child, listening,
Knows that Aunt Sue's stories are real stories.
He knows that Aunt Sue
Never got her stories out of any book at all,
But that they came
Right out of her own life.
And the dark-faced child is quiet
Of a summer night
Listening to Aunt Sue’s stories.",Aunt Sue cuddles a brown-faced child to her bosom and tells him stories. Black slaves work in the hot sun and sing sorrow songs on the banks of a mighty river.
Poem,"The night is beautiful,
So the faces of my people.
The stars are beautiful,
So the eyes of my people.
Beautiful, also, is the sun.
Beautiful, also, are the souls of my people.","The night is beautiful, so the faces of my people. The stars are beautiful,So the eyes of myPeople. The sun is beautiful and so is the sun. The soul is beautiful."
Last Mattress,"This $1,600 slice of foam,
if it stays firm, will be the last mattress
I’ll ever buy. It’s comfortable enough
for years of sleeps, for the long, thwarted hours
of scribbling sentences, or to step from
into the surrey with the fringe on top.
Given the choice between flat-lining here,
and 1,000,000 other possibilities
for the time when my pronouns and now end—
I’d pick my bed, and passing on with good dreams.
One jot, on this little blue and green globe
where life evolved, and consciousness, and hope.","This $1,600 slice of foam, if it stays firm, will be the last mattress I’ll ever buy. It’s comfortable enough for years of sleeps, for the long, thwarted hours."
"On “Phantasmagorique #15,” a Painting by Kathy Goodell","An initial, fine-grained impulse is to claim an anagoge,
The pure image not enough in its ochres and rouge
For us who, like Ariadne, long to weave its spackled ore
Within our sight without retreat to the ovoid view of Mars
We would recall from the probe’s first aching photos
Showing us as much of absence as any articulation
Of what an alien language might say with its discolorations
Along the risen seafloor face of a mountain, barren of blessing,
Garneted with Pompeian lavas and eddyings
Predicted to evanesce under our mesmeric gaze.
We retreat from witness of its charnal blooms,
Our own premonitions of decay, but the eternal itself,
Balanced on its white stool, elephantine oval,
Baroque bruisings of loss, dorsal of earth,
Clawing nail of Cimabue trapped within
The splintered, shit-colored rot of the Cross
No one regrets having disavowed,
Still rises in our guileless dreaming,
Pure blood from our yellow bones,
A quail’s pure egg speckled in splashes of sleep.","An initial, fine-grained impulse is to claim an anagoge. The pure image not enough in its ochres and rouge. We retreat from witness of its charnal blooms."
Joy,"Joy shakes me like the wind that lifts a sail,
Like the roistering wind
That laughs through stalwart pines.
It floods me like the sun
On rain-drenched trees
That flash with silver and green.
I abandon myself to joy—
I laugh—I sing.
Too long have I walked a desolate way,
Too long stumbled down a maze
Bewildered.","Joy shakes me like the wind that lifts a sail, like the roistering wind that laughs through stalwart pines. I abandon myself to joy. I laugh—I sing."
The White Ones,"I do not hate you,
For your faces are beautiful, too.
I do not hate you,
Your faces are whirling lights of loveliness and splendor, too.
Yet why do you torture me,
O, white strong ones,
Why do you torture me?","O, white strong ones, why do you torture me? I do not hate you. I don't hate you, for your faces are beautiful."
Disillusion,"I would be simple again,
Simple and clean
Like the earth,
Like the rain,
Nor ever know,

Nor the salt tears
Of your pain.

Oh, great dark city.

To you again.","I would be simple again,                Simple and clean like the earth,                Like the rain,                Nor ever know,                Dark Harlem,                The wild laughter                Of your mirth                Nor the salt tears                 of your pain.                Let me forget.                I will not come"
Summer Night,"The sounds
Of the Harlem night
Drop one by one into stillness.
The last player-piano is closed. 
The last victrola ceases with the
“Jazz Boy Blues.”
The last crying baby sleeps
And the night becomes
Still as a whispering heartbeat.
I toss
Without rest in the darkness,
Weary as the tired night,
My soul
Empty as the silence,
Empty with a vague,
Aching emptiness,
Desiring,
Needing someone,
Something.
I toss without rest
In the darkness
Until the new dawn,
Wan and pale,
Descends like a white mist
Into the court-yard.

Lament for Dark Peoples,"I was a red man one time,
But the white men came.
I was a black man, too,
But the white men came.
They drove me out of the forest.

Now they’ve caged me
In the circus of civilization.
Now I herd with the many—
Caged in the circus of civilization.

Death of an Old Seaman,"We buried him high on a windy hill,
But his soul went out to sea.
I know, for I heard, when all was still,
His sea-soul say to me:

Strew no flowers on my grave,
I’ve gone back to the wind and wave.
Do not, do not weep for me,

 ghosts calling out, lost as they are, no one you knew in life, a moon above
the whole of it, like the light at the bottom of a well opening in the iced air
 where you have gone under and come back light, no longer tethered
to your own past, and were it not for the weather of trance, of haze and murk, you could
 see everything at once: every moment you have lived or place you have been, without
confusion or bafflement, and you would be one person.

by itself, nor were there whispers or other sounds, no rustling
dress or pet ape trapped in a secret passage, but there was
labored breathing, and unseen hands leafing through
the pages of a visitor’s book, and above the ruins a girl
in white lace, and five or more candles floating,
and someone did see a white dog bound into a nearby
wood, but there were neither bagpipes nor smiling skull,
no skeletons piled in the oubliette, and there was,
as it turned out, no yellow monkey, no blood
leaking from a slit throat, and no one saw
a woman carrying the severed head,

graves and there was the distant rumble of cannon.","The box never opened by itself, nor were there whispers or other sounds, no rustling or pet ape trapped in a secret passage.

And do not longer seek to hold me!

    And still; so, dear, good-night.

Thy hand I'll press no more forever,

For the great white wraith by the winding river
    Shall check my steps with might.

    In a hue o' blackest crime,

    How sich things could rightly be;
An' this aggervatin' question
    Seems to keep a-puzzlin' me.
So, will some one please inform me,
    An' this mystery unroll–
How an angel an' a devil
    Can persess the self-same soul?","I've been list'nin' to them lawyers. I've come to the conclusion that I'm most completely beat. I found myself a-wond'rin', how the Lord had come to fashion such an awful man as him."
Two Songs,"A bee that was searching for sweets one day
Through the gate of a rose garden happened to stray.
In the heart of a rose he hid away,
And forgot in his bliss the light of day,
As sipping his honey he buzzed in song;
Though day was waning, he lingered long,
For the rose was sweet, so sweet.
A robin sits pluming his ruddy breast,
And a madrigal sings to his love in her nest:
""Oh, the skies they are blue, the fields are green,
And the birds in your nest will soon be seen!""
She hangs on his words with a thrill of love,
And chirps to him as he sits above,
For the song is sweet, so sweet.
A maiden was out on a summer's day
With the winds and the waves and the flowers at play;
And she met with a youth of gentle air,
With the light of the sunshine on his hair.
Together they wandered the flowers among;
They loved, and loving they lingered long,
For to love is sweet, so sweet.

                        ————
Bird of my lady's bower,
Sing her a song;
Tell her that every hour,
All the day long,
Thoughts of her come to me,
Filling my brain
With the warm ecstasy
Of love's refrain.
Little bird! happy bird!
Being so near,
Where e'en her slightest word
Thou mayest hear,
Seeing her glancing eyes,
Sheen of her hair,
Thou art in paradise,—
Would I were there.
I am so far away,
Thou art so near;
Plead with her, birdling gay,
Plead with my dear.
Rich be thy recompense,
     Fine be thy fee,
If through thine eloquence
     She hearken me.","A bee that was searching for sweets one day happened to stray through the gate of a rose garden. A robin sits pluming his ruddy breast, and a madrigal sings to his love in her nest."
Ode to Tired Bumblebees Who Fall Asleep Inside Flowers with Pollen on their Butts,"Usually, it’s the males. Maybe
they’ve gone out with buddies
in their leks, keeping their radar
tuned for female bees as they move
from sweet pea to mallow flower and
snapdragon, gathering pollen
in those hairy saddlebags called
corbiculae. Maybe they have
no place to return or are lost,
having gone too far from the nest.
Maybe the empty football fields
and elementary school playgrounds,
long unmowed since our common
isolation and teeming now
with yellow dandelions, proved
too much. Sweet alyssum,
phlox; wisteria cascading heavy
out of themselves. Honeysuckle
and evening-scented stock,
dianthus crowned with hint
of cinnamon and smoky clove.
Female bees will also burrow
deep inside the shade of a squash
flower: the closer to the source
of nectar, the warmer and more
quilt-like the air. In the cool
hours of morning, look closely
for the slight but tell-tale
trembling in each flower cup:
there, a body dropped mid-flight,
mid-thought. How we all retreat
behind some folded screen as work
or the world presses in too
soon, too close, too much.","Female bees can burrow deep inside the shade of a squash or mallow flower. The closer to the source of nectar, the warmer and more quilt-like the air."
The Conversation,"All the while he talks to
the boy, their son, on the phone,
she is interrupting, telling him something
to say, not to say, indicating
that she needs to talk to the boy
herself. Rather than dampening
her enthusiasm or trying
to listen to both at once, finally
he hands her the phone. And rather
than resentment, what he feels
inside himself is the primordial
upwelling of tenderness.","The author's wife interrupts him on the phone to talk to their son. He hands her the phone and feels a primordial upwelling of tenderness, he writes."
Give Yourself Some Flowers,"And in the beginning,
God gave your body
a checklist:
Keep your heart
on beat
and your lungs
dancing with oxygen,
not passive to air.
Make sure
the path of your blood
slows down
for checkpoints
and avoids
bumps
in the road.
Train your nerves
to keep a balanced pace
and stay within
the lines
of steady flow.
Push forward
without putting
too much
pressure
on movement.
Remember
to return to water
when your spirit
and its frame
are in drought.
Treat your body
like a well-rounded planet
built for all seasons,
or pretend you are
an adaptable star:
Float in the black
and stay there
if you need to,
save some light
for yourself.
In other words,
rest like the sun does:
Schedule some time
to stay out of sight
when too many people
praise warm energy.
Keep in mind
all of these things
when depression
tells you
nothing is working.
Keep in mind
all of these things
when it tells you
there is no
invisible force
connecting us,
when your veins
are stopped by blood clots,
when your bones are dry,
and the water
is too quick to boil.
Keep in mind
all of these things
when it tells you
that the soul is like the body:
Made to be broken,
open to deterioration
and doubt. Yes,
keep in mind
all of these things
and remember:
Even when it
seems like
the clock isn’t ticking,
you were made perfectly
for this moment
in time.","In the beginning, God gave your body a checklist: keep your heart on beat and your lungs dancing with oxygen. Train your nerves to keep a balanced pace and stay within the lines of steady flow."
Eye on the Sparrow,"I woke to rapid flapping, the air cold
the time unknown. The dog’s paws tapping
on chill hardwood floor. Sudden
commotion. Jumping to corral what was
assumed to be an animal fight, I find
a California Towhee in my dining room.
Frantic, frightened. Brisk movement in her
wings making the room that much more frigid.
I stammer to her. Follow her room to room
as she attempts to fly her way out of walls
until she finally calms, allowing me to cup her
into my hands. We sit together outside
on a frosty concrete step. My bare feet
settling on top of wet fall leaves, gathering
the taste of morning in my mouth, the scent
of rain and dirt. She catches her breath.
My thumb softly wrapped around her chest
feeling her heart rate regulating, her eyes opening,
her fear receding. Leaves rustle, wind and traffic
move along while she and I watch each other
in a place where time moves slower than the rest
of the world. Her eyelids the color of peach
and terracotta. Her body the rusty hue of autumn.
Her eyes the same shade as mine, dark as loam.
I flatten my hand. She doesn’t move. We sit
together for what seems like hours. What seems
like fate when safety is reciprocated. Ten minutes
later she flies, stops on a dog-eared picket
and looks back. The dog quietly watches me.
How I love and let go all at once.","A California Towhee was found flapping her wings in my dining room. When she finally calms, allowing me to cup her                into my hands. We sit together outside on a frosty concrete step."
"Dolores, Maybe","I’ve never spoken to anyone about this.  Until now, until you.
I slept once in a field beyond the riverbank,
a flock of nightjars watching over me.
That was the summer a farmer found his daughter
hanging in the hayloft, and wished, for the first time,
he had not touched her so.
I wish I could say we were close—the girl and I,
I mean—but I only knew her to wave hello,
and walked her, once, halfway up the road
before turning finally into my grandmother’s yard.
This was Ontario, California. 1983.
Which is to say, there was no river.
And I wouldn’t know a nightjar if it bit me.
But the girl was real. And the day they found her, that was real.
And the dress she wore, same as on our walk—
periwinkle, she called it; I called it blue,
blue with bright yellow flowers all over
—the dress and the flowers, they too were real.
And on our walk, I remember, we cut through the rail yard, 
and came upon a dead coyote lying near the tracks.
A frail and dusty heap of regret, he was companion to no one.
We stared at him for some time, our shadows stretched long and covering the animal.
She said something I’d remember for years, about loneliness,
but have long forgotten, the way I’ve forgotten—
though I can see her face as if she were standing right here—her very name.
Let’s call her Dolores, from dolor. Spanish for anguish.
And whatever the sky, however lovely that afternoon, 
I remember mostly the wind, 
how a breeze unraveled what was left of a braid, 
and when I tried to brush from Dolores’s brow 
a few loose strands, how she flinched,
how she ran the rest of the way home,
how I never saw her after that,
except when they carried her from the barn—her periwinkle dress,
her blue legs and arms, and the fields 
ablaze with daisies.
I spent the rest of that summer in the rail yard 
with my dead coyote, watching trains loaded and leaving.
All summer long, I’d pelt him with stones.
All summer long, I’d use the stones to spell the girl’s name—
Dolores, maybe—in the dirt.
All summer long, fire ants crawled over and between each letter—
her name, now, its own small town.
A season of heat and heavy rains washed my coyote to nothing.  
Only teeth and a few stubborn bones 
that refused, finally, to go down.
Weeks into autumn, someone found the father
hanged from the same groaning tie-beams,
the hayloft black with bottle flies.
But that was 1983. Ontario, California.  
Which is to say, the bottle flies are dead. So, too, the ants.  
And neither field nor barn is where I left it.
I’ve never spoken to anyone about this. Until now, until you.
I gathered a handful of my coyote’s bones, his teeth,
and strung them all on fishing wire—
a talisman to ward off anguish. A talisman I hold out to you now.
Please. Come closer. Take this from my hand.

On Metaphor,"In back of daddy’s closet, 
behind the cold and loaded 
pistol, I find a cedar box 
of snapshots—his company 
in camouflage, waving rifles,
reefer, and middle fingers 
at the photographer. At you.  
And at me. And here, 
the full-lipped redbone
he left in the world without
a goodbye. Here, a strange
boy with my father’s forehead,
same sullen eyes. Flip the photo: 
a stranger’s name and dates 
that don’t add, scrawled as if
rushed, as if a fugitive’s note
slipped quick to the future.
When my mother walks in,
I shove the box to the back
of the shelf, say nothing
of the redbone or the boy.
I hand her, instead, the pistol.
A .45, I believe. Its cold barrel
swelling in the room’s bum
light. When she angles it,
just so, I think I see my father
reflected in the steel. Wait, no—
Not my father. It’s me.

Variation on a Theme by Elizabeth Bishop,"Start with loss. Lose everything. Then lose it all again.  
Lose a good woman on a bad day. Find a better woman, 
then lose five friends chasing her. Learn to lose as if 
your life depended on it. Learn that your life depends on it.
Learn it like karate, like riding a bike. Learn it, master it.
Lose money, lose time, lose your natural mind.
Get left behind, then learn to leave others. Lose and
lose again. Measure a father’s coffin against a cousin’s 
crashing T-cells. Kiss your sister through prison glass.  
Know why your woman’s not answering her phone.
Lose sleep. Lose religion. Lose your wallet in El Segundo.  
Open your window. Listen: the last slow notes
of a Donny Hathaway song. A child crying. Listen:  
A drunk man is cussing out the moon. He sounds like 
your dead uncle, who, before he left, lost a leg 
to sugar. Shame. Learn what’s given can be taken; 
what can be taken, will. This you can bet on without 
losing. Sure as nightfall and an empty bed. Lose
and lose again. Lose until it’s second nature. Losing
farther, losing faster. Lean out your open window, listen:
The child is laughing now. No, it’s the drunk man again
in the street, losing his voice, suffering each invisible star. 
 ","Losing is like karate, like riding a bike. Learn to lose as if your life depends on it. Start with loss. Then lose it all again."
Troubled Woman,"She stands

Again. ","She stands                In the quiet darkness,                This troubled woman,                Bowed by                Weariness and pain,                Like an                Autumn flower                 in the frozen rain.                Like"

                      to live happily ever after.
Today is all she could manage,

                      tamping down the day’s anarchy.
Twenty years earlier, her voice left her,
           so she quit smoking. When it returned

Today she smells facts:

Three Wrong Notes,"Note the diameter of your invisible ink tattoo as if it hides
a crossword hint like “Clueless dope for dopamine”
But not because your inner twin sold all your Rap albums
for a white powder that made you feel touched by God, yet
left a trail like Comet. Note how a certain name trails off with
the number e to perhaps signify their constant interest in
a continuously growing silence. Does an infinite series
of silences imply addition or addiction? In one language
you understand, pegadu means touching and begins with
the letter P. Like Pi is filled with touches of fruitful irrationality,
and may hide a circle’s Private Key. Note how rumors of you
crossing the street to sneak rides on fire trucks are irrational, but
not because you’re vain or became a pyromaniac. The circumference
of urinal cakes may be solved with Pi or dissolved with pee.
Is it irrational that you looped like an extension cord while trying
to solve for the value of P, but got beat like a bowl of egg yolks
for wetting the bed? During the beating was their mouth agápē or
agape? Has it not been proven that trauma only feels transcendental
due to the ratio of the diameter which severs us to the circumference
which makes us a whole? Being born under the Sign of the Asp might
be key, but note that a Volta can turn in currents of a Ghanaian river
or in currents alternating like a weathervane until any cryptic tattoo
could simply signify who held you down and touched you, but also
told you to hold it forever because their love was like the Holy Ghost.","The diameter of your invisible ink tattoo as if it hides a crossword hint like “Clueless dope for dopamine’ Like Pi is filled with touches of fruitful irrationality, and may hide a circle’s Private Key."
Not Once,"Not once—not when I toppled, rigid, a

plank, 16 x 32,
and not while I wallowed on the rug among
his oxygen tubes and my cane and his 8
wheelchair wheels, and not when I sat by his
hospice bed, chirping I’m fine!,
and not the next day, when the brilliant violet
and black slash-slathered in my easy-life skin,
or days later when the purple turned yellow and the
blue green—never once when I
said No pain, Nothing broken,
did I feel lucky, did I measure the force of the
blow, the floor speeding up like a heavy-weight’s
smash to my cheek and eyebrow, not until
today, did I begin to feel
grateful for my good fortune—no concussion, no
fracture—as if I expected to be able to be
struck by the earth, a wrecking ball,
and not feel it—

Barbara Frietchie,"Up from the meadows rich with corn,
Clear in the cool September morn,
The clustered spires of Frederick stand
Green-walled by the hills of Maryland.
Round about them orchards sweep,
Apple- and peach-tree fruited deep,
Fair as a garden of the Lord
To the eyes of the famished rebel horde,
On that pleasant morn of the early fall
When Lee marched over the mountain wall,—
Over the mountains winding down,
Horse and foot, into Frederick town.
Forty flags with their silver stars,
Forty flags with their crimson bars,
Flapped in the morning wind: the sun
Of noon looked down, and saw not one.
Up rose old Barbara Frietchie then,
Bowed with her fourscore years and ten;
Bravest of all in Frederick town,
She took up the flag the men hauled down;
In her attic window the staff she set,
To show that one heart was loyal yet.
Up the street came the rebel tread,
Stonewall Jackson riding ahead.
Under his slouched hat left and right
He glanced: the old flag met his sight.
“Halt!”— the dust-brown ranks stood fast.
“Fire!”— out blazed the rifle-blast.
It shivered the window, pane and sash;
It rent the banner with seam and gash.
Quick, as it fell, from the broken staff
Dame Barbara snatched the silken scarf;
She leaned far out on the window-sill,
And shook it forth with a royal will.
“Shoot, if you must, this old gray head,
But spare your country’s flag,” she said.
A shade of sadness, a blush of shame,
Over the face of the leader came;
The nobler nature within him stirred
To life at that woman’s deed and word:
“Who touches a hair of yon gray head
Dies like a dog! March on!” he said.
All day long through Frederick street
Sounded the tread of marching feet:
All day long that free flag tost
Over the heads of the rebel host.
Ever its torn folds rose and fell
On the loyal winds that loved it well;
And through the hill-gaps sunset light
Shone over it with a warm good-night.
Barbara Frietchie’s work is o’er,
And the Rebel rides on his raids no more.
Honor to her! and let a tear
Fall, for her sake, on Stonewall’s bier.
Over Barbara Frietchie’s grave
Flag of Freedom and Union, wave!
Peace and order and beauty draw
Round thy symbol of light and law;
And ever the stars above look down
On thy stars below in Frederick town!","The flag of Frederick, Maryland, flew over Stonewall Jackson’s head all day long. Barbara Frietchie, the bravest of all in Frederick town, took up the flag the men hauled down. “Shoot, if you must, this old gray head,” she said."
February,"I’m climbing out of this season, fingernails ragged, belly soft. I tuck a stem of dried mint behind my ear to remind myself.
Once, I bared my shoulders. The bottom of my feet roughed up the dirt with their hard calluses. When I harvested arugula, it smelled of green spice—alchemical veins pulsing sun and dirt and water. I do remember this. I pinned summer light up in my hair and made no apologies for the space I took up—barely clothed and sun-bound.
Now, a ball of twine in the grey sky. The sun rolls low on the horizon. Hangs. Then dips back down again, wind howling us into night.
Inside the erratic rhythm of this wavering flame, I conjure the potent sky of the longest day. Seeds with a whole galaxy inside them. Cicadas vibrating in the alders.
But the sensation of joy slips too quickly into simulacra. Song on repeat. I never meant to find myself in such a cold place, my hair thinning against winter.
Once, red clover grew thick where today’s rabbit tracks pattern the snow. Clover said flow, clover said nourish, clover said we’ve got this.
I reel the memory out, let it linger on the horizon, then reel it back in. I play it out and reel it back in. Some kind of fishing, some kind of flying—again and again. I loosen the buckles of my mind. I take up space in the precision of my breath. I call us all back in.","Once, I bared my shoulders.

The Crystal Gazer,"I shall gather myself into myself again,
   I shall take my scattered selves and make them one,

   Watching the future come and the present go,
And the little shifting pictures of people rushing
   In restless self-importance to and fro.","""I shall sit like a sibyl, hour after hour intent, watching the future come and the present go"" ""I shall gather myself into myself again, gathering my scattered selves and making them one"""
Apparition,"translated by Wilfrid Thorley
The moon grew sad, and weeping seraphim,
Musing among the vaporous flowers aswim,
With slow bows from the sobbing viols drew
White tears that sank in their corónals blue.
It was the blesséd day of your first kiss.
My reverie, eager with new miseries,
Was all a-swoon with perfume of shy grief
That leaves the heart to gather its own sheaf,
And frets not, nor yet sickens of its prize.
I wandered, and the worn way held my eyes
When in the street I saw your sun-girt hair
And you all smiling in the twilit air.
I took you for that elf who, crowned with beams,
Once passed before me in my childish dreams,
And shed white posies of sweet-smelling flow’rs
Star-like for tiny hands in snowy show’rs.
    Apparition 
  La lune s’attristait. Des séraphins en pleurs
Rêvant, l’archet aux doigts, dans le calme des fleurs

—C’était le jour béni de ton premier baiser.

Quand avec du soleil aux cheveux, dans la rue
Et dans le soir, tu m’es en riant apparue
Et j’ai cru voir la fée au chapeau de clarté
Qui jadis sur mes beaux sommeils d’enfant gâté
Passait, laissant toujours de ses mains mal fermées
Neiger de blancs bouquets d’étoiles parfumées.","The moon grew sad, and weeping seraphim,                Musing among the vaporous flowers aswim.                White tears that sank in their corónals blue.                It was the blesséd day of your first kiss.                My reverie, eager with new miseries,                Was all a-swoon with perfume of shy grief."

And tell me that my longing love had won your own,
I think all my sad thoughts would then be put away,
And I could give back laughter for the Ocean’s moan!","If you could sit with me beside the sea to-day,774I think I should not find the clouds so dim and gray,774And not so loud the waves complaining at the shore.774I could give back laughter for the Ocean’s moan!774. I think all my sad thoughts would then be put away,774."
Whittier,"Not o'er thy dust let there be spent
The gush of maudlin sentiment;
Such drift as that is not for thee,
Whose life and deeds and songs agree,
Sublime in their simplicity.
Nor shall the sorrowing tear be shed.
O singer sweet, thou art not dead!
In spite of time's malignant chill,
With living fire thy songs shall thrill,
And men shall say, ""He liveth still!""
Great poets never die, for Earth
Doth count their lives of too great worth
To lose them from her treasured store;
So shalt thou live for evermore—
Though far thy form from mortal ken—
Deep in the hearts and minds of men.",The poet's life and deeds and songs are sublime in their simplicity. Not o'er thy dust let there be spent the gush of maudlin sentiment.
Not They Who Soar,"Not they who soar, but they who plod
Their rugged way, unhelped, to God
Are heroes; they who higher fare,
And, flying, fan the upper air,
Miss all the toil that hugs the sod.
'Tis they whose backs have felt the rod,
Whose feet have pressed the path unshod,
May smile upon defeated care,
    Not they who soar.
High up there are no thorns to prod,
Nor boulders lurking 'neath the clod
To turn the keenness of the share,
For flight is ever free and rare;
But heroes they the soil who've trod,
    Not they who soar!","""Not they who soar, but they who plod their way, unhelped, to God are heroes"" - The Book of Psalms."
A Tremor Is Heard in the House of the Dead Man,"A tremor is heard in the house of the dead man 
And a door opens slowly 
Soon after the body is brought to the ground. 
He listens to the talk of the mourners, 
Sipping the words like a bird at a strange water 
Far from home. 
He flutters to him who saw the door opening, 
Calling in a reedy voice to the merciful God 
Who rots the beams and rusts the doors from their hinges. 
The grave lies north. 
He darts through an open window and flies southward
Toward some hovering dots on a white cloud. 
A butterfly comes to the open window, 
Enters—(How strange! 
I’ll drive it away. Do not hurt it.)— 
And blunders back to the garden. 
The voices ebb and resume. 
The clock ticks. 
Father.
    Un temblor se oye en la casa del muerto
  Un temblor se oye en la casa del muerto. 
Y una puerta se abre lentamente 
Poco después de haber dejado el cuerpo en la tierra. 
Escucha la charla de los dolientes, 
Sorbiendo las palabras como un pájaro en un agua rara
Lejos de hogar. 
Aletea hacia el que vio la puerta abrirse, 
Invocando con una voz aflautado al Dios misericordioso
Quien pudre las vigas y oxida las puertas de sus goznes. 
La tumba yace hacia el norte. 
Se lanza por una ventana abierta y vuela hacia el sur. 
Hacia algunos puntos flotando en una nube blanca. 
Una mariposa llega a la ventana abierta, 
Entra—(¡Qué raro! 
La ahuyentaré. Que no le hagas daño.)— 
Y vuelve torpemente al jardín. 
Las voces bajan y se reanudan. 
El reloj hace tictac. 
Padre.

Seeking Always the Word Nearest to Silence,"Seeking always the word nearest to silence—
For speech is a fever, as life an ague of nature—
One nears the undifferentiated nothing, 
The last mask of the multiple delusion. 
Words that have not shape, color or hardness,
Smell or brightness, or the vivid serial ticking
Of clock or heart, attract as if to say: 
Prepare for unbeing, the first and last life. 
Of yesterday’s garden the unsubstantiated green
And dim birdsong are true eternity, 
Though I and this mower accept the tricks of sense,
Hear and hunger, look and thirst, like fools.
    Buscando siempre la palabra más cercana al silencio
Buscando siempre la palabra más cercana al silencio—
Ya que el habla es una fiebre, como la vida es un agüe de 
      la naturaleza— 
Uno se acerca a la indiferenciada nada, 
La última máscara de la desilusión múltiple. 
Palabras que no tienen forma, color o dureza, 
Olor o brillo, o el vívido tictac en serie 
Del reloj o del corazón, que atrae como si dijera: 
Prepárate para el no ser, la primera y última vida. 
Del jardín de ayer el verde infundado 
Y el tenue canto de los pájaros son la verdadera eternidad,
Aunque yo y este cortacésped aceptamos los engaños de 
     los sentidos, 
Oír y tener hambre, mirar y tener sed, como orates.

Why I Write Poetry,"After Major Jackson
Because I could say my friends' exes live in a swamp in my heart
            and no one would ask what it means.
Because my head is level and my wrists are narrow.
Because after block parties and cookouts my mom corralled us
            into the bathtub to wash dirt from our soles.
Because nowadays I go to bed with unwashed feet.
Because everyone who didn't eat breakfast in my house hates grapefruit.
Because instead of letting people in, I rebuild myself around them.
Because it haunts me that my aunt would still be alive
            if she still had health insurance.
Because I still think about characters in books I read at age eleven
            now nameless and faceless.
Because all my poems end up in AP style.
Because I always have a crush on someone taller than me.
Because I can't find anyone in New England who knows what it's like
            to ride the Brown Line over the Chicago River in summertime.
Because my best friend and I have different words for love.
Because I'm still afraid to die.
Because I rode Razor scooters on the blacktop with the boys before school.
Because walking through Boston feels like spitting out cold air.
Because I spend a Valentine's Day at a funeral I couldn't cry at.
Because the winter always makes me like this.
Because I don't know what I mean by like this.","Because I could say my friends' exes live in a swamp in my heart and no one would ask what it means. Because instead of letting people in, I rebuild myself around them. Because I'm still afraid to die. Because walking through Boston feels like spitting out cold air."
The Master-Player,"An old worn harp that had been played
Till all its strings were loose and frayed,
Joy, Hate and Fear, each one essayed,
To play. But each in turn had found
No sweet responsiveness of sound

Then Love the Master-Player came
With heaving breast and eyes aflame;
The Harp he took all undismayed,
Smote on its strings, still strange to song,
And brought forth music sweet and strong.","An old worn harp that had been played until all its strings were loose and frayed. Love the Master-Player came with heaving breast and eyes aflame. The Harp he took all undismayed,Smote on its strings, still strange to song."
The Corn-Stalk Fiddle,"When the corn's all cut and the bright stalks shine
    Like the burnished spears of a field of gold;
When the field-mice rich on the nubbins dine,
    And the frost comes white and the wind blows cold;
Then it's heigh-ho! fellows and hi-diddle-diddle,
    For the time is ripe for the corn-stalk fiddle.
And you take a stalk that is straight and long,
    With an expert eye to its worthy points,
And you think of the bubbling strains of song
    That are bound between its pithy joints —
Then you cut out strings, with a bridge in the middle,
    With a corn-stalk bow for a corn-stalk fiddle.
Then the strains that grow as you draw the bow
    O'er the yielding strings with a practised hand!
And the music's flow never loud but low
    Is the concert note of a fairy band.
Oh, your dainty songs are a misty riddle
    To the simple sweets of a corn-stalk fiddle.
When the eve comes on, and our work is done,
    And the sun drops down with a tender glance,
With their hearts all prime for the harmless fun,
    Come the neighbor girls for the evening's dance,
And they wait for the well-known twist and twiddle—
    More time than tune—from the corn-stalk fiddle.
Then brother Jabez takes the bow,
    While Ned stands off with Susan Bland,
Then Henry stops by Milly Snow,
    And John takes Nellie Jones's hand,
While I pair off with Mandy Biddle,
    And scrape, scrape, scrape goes the corn-stalk fiddle.
""Salute your partners,"" comes the call,
    ""All join hands and circle round,""
""Grand train back,"" and ""Balance all,""
    Footsteps lightly spurn the ground.
""Take your lady and balance down the middle""
    To the merry strains of the corn-stalk fiddle.
So the night goes on and the dance is o'er,
    And the merry girls are homeward gone,
But I see it all in my sleep once more,
    And I dream till the very break of dawn
Of an impish dance on a red-hot griddle
    To the screech and scrape of a corn-stalk fiddle.","When the corn's all cut and the bright stalks shine like the burnished spears of a field of gold, the time is ripe for the corn-stalk fiddle. The strains that grow as you draw the bow O'er the yielding strings with a practised hand!"

Afternoon in Andalusia,"But why wouldn’t geometry equal divinity
1000 + 1 + 1 + 1         What is faith
but trust in one & infinity         Once

in Granada I studied a wall of polygons
or was it stars or bees         or for a second         a flash

Inspiration Point,"Pacific Palisades
We’d stare at horses at Will Rogers Park, then hike
the Loop Trail to Inspiration Point, &
I’d lag back 
to be a kid. Alone. & under that aloofness—hid
vengeance. A rusty burr or two 
in my left sneaker. & under that—anxiety. The salt 
dripping through chaparral 
brows, into my brown lashes. &
under that—rage. A perfectly purple 
shell some kid favored & lost.
& under that—hope. The pounded 
ground. & under that—a vast
clearing on the cosmos, also called Inspiration
Point. A gorgeous, inner hilltop
with a curious figure 
taking in the Pacific view. 
Breathing chicory & chamise. Naming 
every wind-boarder near Catalina 
Island. That high-noon, far-sighted figure—seemed
a bit burnt, but warm. A bit divine. 
But—sometimes—I didn’t find that figure 
wow-ing at a thing 
no one had ever seen—at a new bird 
better than a phoenix. (There’s something better than 
a phoenix!) Sometimes, my hand 
stretched towards some nether new
creation & I was the figure 
who named it.","Inspiration Point is a gorgeous, inner hilltop with a curious figure taking in the Pacific view. That high-noon, far-sighted figure—seemeda bit burnt, but warm. A bit divine."
Euler’s Equation,"Let me draw a sonnet at this godless hour,
in one sitting, at the sudden taste of you.
#SelfEvidentTruth: reality forms from the verge
of chance—particles not seen but tongued.
Another you wafts in as soon as the other
you leaves, my random turnstile of thirst.
But suddenly, alone. Just a memory of taste:
Poached eggs, pancakes, tenderness, knowing
that I have eaten not only what I made but what all
of you served in return, quenched only if swallowed.
Taste has always been a second-rate sense,
unlike our sight, unlike Euler’s Equation that
sees light in chaos. All works of nature evolve
from one moment of coincidence. An absence,
a rebellion, the fifteenth line of a sonnet.","Let me draw a sonnet at this godless hour, at the sudden taste of you. Reality forms from the verge of chance—particles not seen but tongued. All works of nature evolvefrom one moment of coincidence."
Little Matrons,"slumped in the crook of a nook, bereft
of lullabies and apple pie, playing duck duck
goose with my mind to find the smallest child
nested inside another then another until I
ring around the rosie back to myself. This
recess is cold. It’s like everyone vamoosed
to get to America first. Hello, what if we didn’t
want to go? All that’s left is an echo and a
banshee I hardly know. Some people say
hypnosis or past life regression therapy may
help, but I locked this chamber for a reason.
Ate the key. What is the shape of memory
that needs to be forgotten? Yet a voice keeps
calling: Let me out, let me out, let me out, let me",The author was left with no memory of her childhood. She spent hours playing duck duck goose with her mind to find the smallest child inside another then another until she was back to herself.
Recurrence,"We shall have our little day.
Take my hand and travel still
Round and round the little way,
Up and down the little hill.
It is good to love again;
Scan the renovated skies,
Dip and drive the idling pen,
Sweetly tint the paling lies.
Trace the dripping, piercèd heart,
Speak the fair, insistent verse,
Vow to God, and slip apart,
Little better, little worse.
Would we need not know before
How shall end this prettiness;
One of us must love the more,
One of us shall love the less.
Thus it is, and so it goes;
We shall have our day, my dear.

Buds the new, another year.","""We shall have our day, my dear. We shall haveOur little day"" ""Little better, little worse. Would we need not know before?"" ""One of us must love the more, one of us shall love the less"""
Snow in October,"Today I saw a thing of arresting poignant beauty:
A strong young tree, brave in its Autumn finery
Of scarlet and burnt umber and flame yellow,
Bending beneath a weight of early snow,
Which sheathed the north side of its slender trunk,
And spread a heavy white chilly afghan
Over its crested leaves.
Yet they thrust through, defiant, glowing,
Claiming the right to live another fortnight,
Clamoring that Indian Summer had not come,
Crying “Cheat! Cheat!” because Winter had stretched
Long chill fingers into brown, streaming hair
Of fleeing October.
The film of snow shrouded the proud redness of the tree,
As premature grief grays the strong head
Of a virile, red-haired man.","A strong young tree, brave in its Autumn finery, bravely stood in the snow. It was defiant, glowing,Claiming the right to live another day. But Winter had stretched its fingers into brown, streaming hair."
Song,"My heart to thy heart,
   My hand to thine;
My lips to thy lips,
   Kisses are wine
Brewed for the lover in sunshine and shade;
Let me drink deep, then, my African maid.
Lily to lily,
    Rose unto rose;
My love to thy love
    Tenderly grows.
Rend not the oak and the ivy in twain,
Nor the swart maid from her swarthier swain.","Kisses are wine brewed for the lover in sunshine and shade. My heart to thy heart, my hand to thine, my lips to thy lips, my African maid."
Fulfilment,"I grew a rose once more to please mine eyes.
All things to aid it—dew, sun, wind, fair skies—
Were kindly; and to shield it from despoil,
I fenced it safely in with grateful toil.
No other hand than mine shall pluck this flower, said I,
And I was jealous of the bee that hovered nigh.
It grew for days; I stood hour after hour
To watch the slow unfolding of the flower,
And then I did not leave its side at all,
Lest some mischance my flower should befall.
At last, oh joy! the central petals burst apart.
It blossomed—but, alas! a worm was at its heart!","I grew a rose once more to please mine eyes. I fenced it safely in with grateful toil. No other hand than mine shall pluck this flower, said I."
Cancer and Nova,"The star exploding in the body; 
The creeping thing, growing in the brain or the bone;
The hectic cannibal, the obscene mouth. 
The mouths along the meridian sought him, 
Soft as moths, many a moon and sun, 
Until one 
In a pale fleeing dream caught him. 
Waking, he did not know himself undone, 
Nor walking, smiling, reading that the news was good,
The star exploding in his blood.
    Cáncer y Nova
  La estrella estallando en el cuerpo; 
Algo rastrero, creciendo en el cerebro o en el hueso; 
El caníbal hético, la boca obscena. 
Las bocas del meridiano lo buscaron, 
Blandas como polillas, muchas lunas y soles, 
Hasta que una 
En un sueño desvaído y fugaz, lo atrapó. 
Despertando, no se reconocía a sí mismo deshecho, 
Ni caminando, sonriendo, o leyendo que las noticias eran buenas,
La estrella estallando en su sangre.

Promise,"I grew a rose within a garden fair,
And, tending it with more than loving care,
I thought how, with the glory of its bloom,
I should the darkness of my life illume;
And, watching, ever smiled to see the lusty bud
Drink freely in the summer sun to tinct its blood.
My rose began to open, and its hue
Was sweet to me as to it sun and dew;
I watched it taking on its ruddy flame
Until the day of perfect blooming came,
Then hasted I with smiles to find it blushing red —
Too late! Some thoughtless child had plucked my rose and fled!","The author grew a rose within a garden fair. He drank freely in the summer sun to tinct its blood. He thought how, with the glory of its bloom, he should the darkness of his life illume."
The Seedling,"As a quiet little seedling
    Lay within its darksome bed,
To itself it fell a-talking,
    And this is what it said:
“I am not so very robust,
    But I’ll do the best I can;”
And the seedling from that moment
    Its work of life began.
So it pushed a little leaflet
    Up into the light of day,
To examine the surroundings
    And show the rest the way.
The leaflet liked the prospect,
    So it called its brother, Stem;
Then two other leaflets heard it,
    And quickly followed them.
To be sure, the haste and hurry
    Made the seedling sweat and pant;
But almost before it knew it
    It found itself a plant.
The sunshine poured upon it,
    And the clouds they gave a shower;
And the little plant kept growing
    Till it found itself a flower.
Little folks, be like the seedling,
    Always do the best you can;
Every child must share life’s labor
    Just as well as every man.
And the sun and showers will help you
    Through the lonesome, struggling hours,
Till you raise to light and beauty
    Virtue’s fair, unfading flowers.","A seedling fell into a darksome bed and said to itself: “I am not so very robust, but I’ll do the best I can;” The seedling pushed a little leaflet into the light of day to examine the surroundings.

Passion and Love,"A maiden wept and, as a comforter,
Came one who cried, 'I love thee,' and he seized
Her in his arms and kissed her with hot breath,
That dried the tears upon her flaming cheeks.
While evermore his boldly blazing eye
Burned into hers; but she uncomforted
Shrank from his arms and only wept the more.
Then one came and gazed mutely in her face
With wide and wistful eyes; but still aloof
He held himself; as with a reverent fear,
As one who knows some sacred presence nigh.
And as she wept he mingled tear with tear,
That cheered her soul like dew a dusty flower,—
Until she smiled, approached, and touched his hand!","A maiden wept and, as a comforter, came one who cried, 'I love thee' He seized her in his arms and kissed her with hot breath."
"It’s Not Really about Them, It’s about Us","Braiding my hair, working with, and not against,
the silver waves, breaking through the crests
of my crushed curls—
I consider my life, my regrets and my absences,
my not-love life at press time, the small bundle
of garbage, tied-up by the door,
and I think, looking into the mirror, As soon
as I don’t need them, that’s when they’ll come
running; it’s a law, it’s diffusion
and I think, I could write a theory of whiteness,
but I won’t, because that’s exactly what they want.
Then I follow that with,

lines in the quiet of my quiet-dark,

"January 20, 2021","This morning the snow
lowered so slowly, I was able
to lift my son—still in pajamas—
and show him each delicate
tendril of frost, the arctic structure
of a solitary flake. I was able
to make coffee and think only
of making coffee, a sensation
so sudden and dangerous
in its delight, I had to dilute it
by burning the toast. This morning
I breathed deeply, clicked on
the television and watched—
for a moment—a Boeing VC-25 fade
over our capital and dwindle
from sight. Nothing says revenge
like dwindle from sight. Later,
I’ll hear the new president pledge
to be better, try a bit harder.
I will try to believe him
the way a child believes a father
in an overcoat, by the door.
But for now, all is quiet.
My coffee tastes delicious,
and nothing says revenge like
the stillness of snow.","This morning the snow                lowered so slowly, I was able                to lift my son and show him each delicateipienttendril of frost. Nothing says revenge like dwindle from sight. Later, I’ll hear the new president pledgeto be better, try a bit harder."
Insurrecto,"for David Fagen
Corporal, U.S. Army (1898-1899); Captain, Philippine Republican Army (1899-1901)
Our worst enemy is General May:
rainy season, the lieutenant means, monsoon
much like Tampa’s summer storms. Roads become marsh;
not just flooding but fever, a fire
that hollows me out. We throw lifelines
to overturned ferries; casualties grow long.
Incessant drizzle. Letters take too long
to reach home. I prefer carousal, cards: dismay
in officers’ faces when I cross the line.
The guardhouse my second home. My fines soon
add up: a month’s pay. Most of it earned, so far,
by killing time, not ladrones: we march
to summits, spy gugus drilling below; march
back down to find the enemy long
gone—only grinning farmers left. Hellfire
spits the lieutenant, scanning ridges, amazed
to have been rolled by shoeless bandits again. Soon
he’ll snap, like the officers in Samar who lined
up boys young as ten—sympathizers, aligned
with insurgents. (So said General Smith.) Marshaled
them, blindfolded, to clearings. Too soon
for them to swell the soil; long
rest for short lives. Their will bewilders me—
faced with Gatlings, Krags, methodical shellfire
they ambush hand to hand. Bolos; sniper fire
in enfilades. Harass our lines
then beat back to boondocks, a maze
of jungle, cordilleras, rice fields, marsh.
Land surely rich with poetry—tulang
in their tongue—land like home: typhoon
cousin to hurricane. When the monsoon
shifts, so do I—I snap, desert for foreign fires.
Rope can kill black soldiers but not disease, lungs
like ours grittier, the C.O.s say; we’re maligned
but nicknamed “Immunes.” My old unit marches,
black against brown. Under white. As if to make
the Far East a second South. I captain a line
for the Filipino side: a turncoat, merging
nations. Our flag has no color. Soon it may.",David Fagen served in the U.S. Army and the Philippine Republican Army. Fagen describes fighting in the Philippines in the 1800s and early 1900s. He describes fighting against the monsoon rains and fighting insurgents.
[Oye! This is an apartment building ode.],"Oye! This is an apartment building ode.
But not just any ode, an ode about breathing,
walking, jumping, running, skipping people.
An ode to a time where we’d remember what
odes felt like to read outside. An ode about
oding so hard it boxes itself into a sonnet.
Harder than bus stop benches and light rail
seats, taxes, and systemic poverty. The oding
of this poem is an apartment building sonnet

Oye! This is The Apartment Building Ode.
  There’s Freestyle, Hip Hop, and Bachata on the steps
depending on the time of day we pick up groceries.
There are bikes by the curb and notebooks on those steps,
soda bottles, 2 quarter juices, and candy wrappers in bags.
There is a 10pm curfew for noise and the music plays
until 9:59, because the stoop DJ wakes up early too.
There are “No loitering on the stairs” signs in every hall-
way though it is understood that what we do isn’t aimless.
There is the smell of food, home-cooked or homemade,
plantains in C5, Hot Pockets in A3 and Chinese in the lobby.
There are lovers, soothsayers, tall-tale tellers, doers, hustlers,
potatoes, flowers, lighters, and so many hand gestures.
 
This is a concrete box that we call home.
There is a life we’ve learned to love and live.",Oye! This is The Apartment Building Ode. An ode to a time where we’d remember what it felt like to read outside. The oding of this poem is an apartment building sonnet.
"Suspending Disbelief While Brown, Part II","We use ketchup because they laughed. And then they used our salt. And then our salt flecked gold. And then our gold was put in their museum.
Their books get newer. Our books miss pages.
Their mothers pay our mothers who come home too tired to mother.
***
What the anger is like:
You write, it reifies. It clots. 
Our misery, it prints. 
We commiserate: we pain and seizure. 
They laugh. They spectate. They garland. They trophy. 
***
What the sadness is like:
Tender word after tender word succumbs before it saves you.
***
What the sadness is like:
You are a sculptor and you cannot move your arms. The marble stares the way desire waits.","We use ketchup because they laughed, and then they used our salt. And then our salt flecked gold was put in their museum. We commiserate: we pain and seizure."
The Song of the Smoke,"I am the smoke king,
I am black.
      I am swinging in the sky,
      I am ringing worlds on high;
      I am the thought of the throbbing mills,
      I am the soul of the Soul toil kills,
      I am the ripple of trading rills.
Up I’m curling from the sod,
I am whirling home to God.
I am the smoke king,
I am black.
I am the smoke king,
I am black.
      I am wreathing broken hearts,
      I am sheathing devils’ darts;
      Dark inspiration of iron times,
      Wedding the toil of toiling climes,
      Shedding the blood of bloodless crimes,
Down I lower in the blue,
Up I tower toward the true.
I am the smoke king,
I am black.
I am the smoke king,
I am black.
      I am darkening with song,
      I am hearkening to wrong;
      I will be black as blackness can,
      The blacker the mantle the mightier the man,
      My purpl’ing midnights no day dawn may ban.
I am carving God in night,
I am painting Hell in white.
I am the smoke king,
I am black.
I am the smoke king,
I am black.
      I am cursing ruddy morn,
      I am hearsing hearts unborn;
      Souls unto me are as mists in the night,
      I whiten my black men, I blacken my white,
      What’s the hue of a hide to a man in his might!
Hail, then, gritty, grimy hands,
Sweet Christ, pity toiling lands!
Hail to the smoke king
Hail to the black!",I am the soul of the Soul toil kills. I am whirling home to God. The blacker the mantle the mightier the man. I will be black as blackness can.
A Reverie,"You may speak of a grave in a distant land,
    Or of one ’neath ocean’s foam,
Where the dolphins play o’er the sunny spray,
    Far from the dear old home;
Where the coral peaks form a glorious tomb,
    And the mighty waters lave,
But there is naught in the wide world sought
    Like the heart’s deep anguished grave.
You may tell of a grave ’neath the burning sands
    Of the tropics fevered zone;
Where silence reigns o’er the desert plains
    So desolate, so forlorn.
Where the lion’s roar is the liveliest sound
    That o’er that waste is heard—
And the forest bird hymns a plaintive lay,
    A requiem for the dead.
Again you may tell of a grave unsought
    Far from the home of youth;
Where the willow weeps as the exile sleeps
    Akin to Mother Earth.
But O! methinks, there’s not a woe
    That can the bosom cleave,
Or as deeply wound, as the lowly mound
    O’er the heart’s deep, anguished grave.",You may tell of a grave ’neath the burning sands of the tropics. But there is naught in the wide world sought like the heart’s deep anguished grave.
Aubade with Edits,"Both terrible storytellers, both bad
            With a punchline
Too, bad with a tale—short, long
            Or otherwise. Both, a little bit
Of college & plenty of experience—
            My parents. Their hands told
On them, & their cooking enough
            To keep mouths too busy
For small talk but not for lies, gold plated
            Lies. “Yes, still waiting
For Jordans or a Walkman,
            & please, no knock-offs.” “No mom,
Not the fakes.” “No, it’s not the same
            As the others, dad.”
O edits, O tweaks that transcend
            Trouble—you, neither fake
Nor fib even when half-awake in the new
            Light when parents revise stories or future
Visions so a paycheck opens
            Wider than my busy-begging
Mouth. Edits, not lies when dad dies
            Alone, broke to the bone. His version
Better than all the unforeseen costs
            Death accrues. Edits, unheard
Requests or complaints from mom’s eyes.
            Her last-month-tongue entangled,
Unable to spin or spend even a nickel’s
            Worth of lies. O Edits, sun’s up cutting
Sleep & dream with light & heat.
            I do nothing while narratives move
Along the ceiling: I’m ok. I’m ok.
            I’m ok. Soon I will tell the lie
To the mirror, to my shoes & car
            Keys, to my kiss-goodbye love,
To my needling co-workers at lunch
             Time, & the commute home again. 
A kiss hello & a kiss for baby, too
            Until back to dream
When my dead parents visit
            With new things to say.","The author's parents are both terrible storytellers, he writes. Edits, not lies when dad dies, are better than all the unforeseen costs, he says."
Self-lit,"You’re humming through the streets,
self-lit. I have to correct strangers
who touch your head without asking,
as if to bless you or to take a blessing from you.
When we leave the city, you become
a boy hunting locusts. Nature stuns you—
you load up your pockets and want to bring it
home with us, but Nature stays with nature, I say,
a refrain learned from another mother.
You cannot be unpuzzled by things,
but you marshal all your sweet bravado for me,
who tries but never beats you in a game of chess.
I witness the rook and Queen
moving inside your thinking, squaring
and hewing to pathways of wins, losses.
Childhood’s end is always menacing,
apparent places of stars mark its outer limits.
It heaves up in you when you lose,
when you rage, when you’re afraid.
Glowering out of a fever dream, your eyes shine
as you confess in the dark I was the monster.
You show me a hornet’s nest on a bed of cotton,
hold it up as an offering. I wonder with you
at what you hold—
            summer rivers that show bracken corners,
            eye agate marbles,
            daggerwings of our days in the city
            built of strangers,
                         in a country built of sky.
When I pull you close,
what will flee trembles in you.","When we leave the city, you becomea boy hunting locusts. You’re humming through the streets, self-lit. I have to correct strangers who touch your head without asking. I witness the rook and Queen squaring and hewing to pathways of wins, losses."
Corinthians 13:11,"I follow Marcia Brady on Twitter: Mo McCormick, Actor/Author.
She posts a video with her older brother and they dance, a fast waltz,
under an oak tree with dozens of hanging pastel paper parasols.
She holds his hands, looks up into his face: he watches her feet.
I wish we were friends. I’d call her, Mo, too, one syllable, low:
prayerful, bovine. Mo asks her brother, do you have a girlfriend yet?
She leads, spins him around: I love her in a way I couldn’t back then.
As a child, I loved the middle girl, Jan, the jealous one, Eve Plumb,
Bible spondee fruit, with a TV J-name, and that blue crochet vest.
When I was a child, I spake as a child, I understood as a child.
When I was a child, I’d see Mo’s face on my tin lunchbox, but now I see
her freckles mirrored a small star cluster visible on clear nights—
Constellation of Bejewelled Silver Studs on Soft Velvet Bell Bottoms.
Constellation of Kindness. Constellation of Purple Devotion.","When I was a child, I loved the middle girl, Jan, the jealous one, Eve Plumb, with a TV J-name, and that blue crochet vest. I’d call her, Mo, too, one syllable, low:prayerful, bovine. I love her in a way I couldn't back then."
Having a Fight With You,"is like being burned up
in a twelfth-floor elevator.
Or drowned in a flipped SUV.
It’s like waking with scalpels 
arrayed on my chest.
Like being banished to 1983.
Having a fight with you 
is never, ever less horrid: that whisper 
that says you never loved me—
my heart a stalled engine
out the little square window.
Your eyes a white-capped black sea.","Having a fight with you is never, ever less horrid: that whisper  that says you never loved me. It's like waking with scalpels arrayed on my chest. Like being banished to 1983."
Walnuts in Nangarhar,"That time
in Aagam when father, a child then, picked
fresh walnuts with the mountain girls;
they showed him the fleshy green
skin over shell & nut he rubbed
on his lips & cheeks, giggling.
The girls circled around him, clapped
in unison & teased. In a hand mirror,
he saw himself stained pink,
a delicious trick that kept
its color a full week—
That time
so long ago, in the
season of walnuts.","The author's father grew up in Aagam, Turkey. He recalls a time when he picked fresh walnuts with mountain girls. The girls circled around him, clapped in unison & teased him."
"Songs to Joannes, VII","My pair of feet

A Prayer,"O Lord, the hard-won miles
    Have worn my stumbling feet:
Oh, soothe me with thy smiles,
    And make my life complete.
The thorns were thick and keen
    Where’er I trembling trod;
The way was long between
    My wounded feet and God.
Where healing waters flow
    Do thou my footsteps lead.
My heart is aching so;
    Thy gracious balm I need.","The thorns were thick and keen. O Lord, the hard-won miles have worn my stumbling feet. Oh, soothe me with thy smiles. And make my life complete."

Acedia Sestina,"How now to rig the petrified words to reveal 
The infinite in a new permutation of language.
How to green again the fallow bandwidth  
Of talk when fire is funeral & river means hearse.
When a syndrome grows precise in the panic-blue air
Where weaving death’s black wing
A muted swarm descends. An empty swing.
Uproot the new park benches to reveal
Cindered bones, the phantom smell of burnt hair
Watering the mouths of the wretched. Gauge 
His strength as the naked king pulls the black hearse
Of myth through jaundice streets bragging its width.
In the shallow arms of the prison cell, a width
Of man’s breath can keep his body warm. A flap of wing
Means sky, to be executed without a hood. As the hearse-
Pulled fare of the nation’s dead reveal
Froth drying in the mouth of his language,
The king’s men upholster the king’s velvet chair.
Pitched to the injured choir, 
His rabid hosts feed the bandwidth
Of fear that plugs the old faultline, prunes language
To the dull blade of history’s axe swing.
What the news stifles, the river unveils:
The shallow graves of sand, the watery hearse.
On the shore, the stray dogs of my nation rehearse
A new hunger. Heat drags in the air
What a flanked disturbance of crows’ flight reveals:
A bloated corpse, twice its living width,
Strangled in a bush. A ballooned arm like a black wing 
Fastened to what has no face in language.
The dogs were feeding off this language,
This purple delirium washed up in a hearse.
Then the keening vultures begin to descend, their wings
Unpetalling like something extracted them mid-air.
I had to remember this, wake & find the width
Of my body bound to this boat for the tidal reveal
At high noon when the width of each shadow’s wing
Dwarfs. I did not rehearse this, I had no guide to veil
The language for what was killing us out of thin air.",How to green again the fallow bandwidth of talk when fire is funeral & river means hearse. How now to rig the petrified words to reveal  the infinite in a new permutation of language.
April Moon,"The moon tonight is closer to us
than it will be
for the rest of the year,
grace willing, the year
we will remember as the Great Pandemic.
Pulling us closer into its orbit,
shining the light of its fullness into the room,
we turn to hold in our hands
each other’s face as if
for the first time,
and the last—
Pink Moon, Egg Moon, Moon of New Grass.","Pink Moon, Egg Moon, Moon of New Grass. The moon tonight is closer to us than it will be for the rest of the year. The year we will remember as the Great Pandemic."

Man Praying—Encroachment,"Some deaths take                  the slow turn            in the light from dusk to night.
My father takes his               time                            is trying to befriend him.
When he goes                        with it                         he will go.
He will trust death                as a friend                 near the end of his life.
There were not many           late nights                  he did his drinking at home.
And worked one job             for 50 years                 he didn’t gamble or cheat.
Was home for dinner           every night                 he listened to us talk in silence.
Now death walks by             his side                        of the bed sinks, his body
Weighs the mattress            down                           the hall it breaks into a sprint.
I witness it encroach            step by step                he eases into lethargy.
Hair and skin looking so     thin                              was he always so thin?
A creaking sound walks       around the house     I hear the weight of delirium.
He can’t sleep with               the noise                     of him gasping echoes.
When he awakes                   he dreams                  his father yelling, Get Up.

The New Year,"The New Year comes—fling wide, fling wide the door
Of Opportunity! the spirit free
To scale the utmost heights of hopes to be,
To rest on peaks ne’er reached by man before!

To search out undiscovered mystery,
Undreamed of in our poor philosophy!
The bounty of the gods upon us pour!
Nay, in the New Year we shall be as gods:
No longer apish puppets or dull clods
Of clay; but poised, empowered to command,
Upon the Etna of New Worlds we’ll stand—
This scant earth-raiment to the winds will cast—
Full richly robed as supermen at last!","In the New Year we shall be as gods: no longer apish puppets or dull clods of clay; but poised, empowered to command.

Velvet Shoes,"Let us walk in the white snow

Nodding under the mistletoe

Stooped in the still and shadowy air
Lips unseen—and kissed me there.","Sitting under the mistletoe                (Pale-green, fairy mistle toe),                One last candle burning low,                All the sleepy dancers gone,                Just one candle burning on.                Shadows lurking everywhere:                Some one came, and kissed me there.                Tired I was; my head would go                Nodding under theMistletoe.                No footsteps"

Tehura,"On viewing Gauguin's Mana'o Tupapa'u ,The Spirit of the Dead Keep Watch
The chill of violet around you,
Olympia of Oceania, you lie pito down:
a burnished, brown body like mine, draped
over white sheets. And for the moment,
I can't move ⎯ How did we get here?
Your framed face turning toward mine,
I see a pleading in your eyes, on your lips
                                                                      a moan of dread.
            Quickly I struck a match, and I saw Tehura,
            immobile, naked, lying face downward on the bed:
            Feet crossed at the ankle, hands palm down, eyes
            inordinately large with fear.
I draw closer to you, mounted on the wall ⎯
            Never had I seen her so beautiful, so tremulously beautiful
see waves of dark hair tucked
behind your delicate ear, pulled
violently from your face, neck.
Your seduction rendered ⎯
            With a scattering of flowers,
            completely naked, waiting for love. Indecent!
through brush strokes of bronze:
arching your back, lifting your chin to meet
                                                        a ceaseless stare.
            She seemed not to know who I was, and I too
            felt a strange uncertainty, in this half-light ⎯
Behind you, the spirit of the dead,
            a dangerous apparition only she could see
more his than yours, looms in black, stares⎯
            I was afraid to move. Might she not take me for a tupapa'u?
blankly, unbending. In its hand,
the spark of a bud lights the tiares⎯
            Yet, such coppery beauty, gold skin ⎯
on your mattress, each blossom opening
                                                        into a glorious sneer.
            ... and the night was soft, soft and ardent, a night of the tropics...
E Tehura, my pokiʻi,
in your face I see my own,
the same curves and shadow twisting
into a sad silence. I know
this is not who we are, not Why or How⎯
only smoke from flailing ghosts, tricks
of fading light, only the wash of gold paint over
                                                        this rotting wood frame.

Root Systems,"for Yolanda P. Salvo
I have this assignment to write on origins. 
All I can think about is your rellenong 
talong at sunrise, garlic thick air, 
wisp of your floral dress sways on linoleum 
as you commit to careful chemistry 
of fried egg. 
                      To say I have roots means all us kids, 
                      knee deep in dirt. Means I only know how 
                      to eat because you brought backyard, earth
                      soaked, each bite caressed by sweat of 
                      forehead. The land gives us what we need
                      not like this country— 
We didn’t get it then, you training us for end 
of times, or maybe, bringing us back to our beginning.

                      harsh light, profuse cackle, grew it into momentum 
                      to fuel every star speckled report card on the fridge,

96°F heat, palm tree silhouette on cheeks. You said
you liked my haircut, So Pogi! Big smirks. Fingertips 
pressed on lychee skin, our version of prayer. 
Not to mention, the way you taught me to pick 
apart until we found tender. 
                      How we knew somehow together, 
                      there could be sweetness. You asked me to open 
                      every fruit, juice like sprinkler from our old house. 
                      This breaking apart. This delicate pouring. 
                      This bulbous bounty. This bellyful harvest
                      was always ours, no matter the soil we stood on.","Yolanda P. Salvo writes about her childhood memories of her father. She recalls how he brought backyard, earth soaked, each bite caressed by sweat of sweat of his forehead."

Three months ago, the stream did flow,
    The lilies bloomed along the edge;
And we were lingering to and fro,—
Where none will track thee in this snow,
    Along the stream, beside the hedge.
Ah! sweet, be free to come and go;
    For if I do not hear thy foot,
    The frozen river is as mute,—
    The flowers have dried down to the root;
    And why, since these be changed since May,
        Shouldst thou change less than they?

And slow, slow as the winter snow,
    The tears have drifted to mine eyes;
And my two cheeks, three months ago,
Set blushing at thy praises so,
    Put paleness on for a disguise.
Ah! sweet, be free to praise and go;
    For if my face is turned to pale,
    It was thine oath that first did fail,—
    It was thy love proved false and frail!
    And why, since these be changed, I trow,
        Should I change less than thou?","Three months ago, the stream did flow, and the lilies bloomed along the edge. The flowers have dried down to the root. And why, since these be changed since May, shouldst thou change less than they?"

Vespers,"after a promise by Staceyann Chin

We Are All God’s Poems,"all I crave is light & yet
                                winter

through,
            host of breath
rehoused & rib scribbled inside
you there above

casting your gaze over us
wanting us to be your mouth

What Is Not,"My twisted alibi, the silent who

not knowing if I aced the test.

Notwithstanding,
it kneels to reason

if not is the godless spot
of who I am. I forgot.","My twisted alibi, the silent who. And almighty why? Or what went wrong? What is not turned sideways or backwards? I forgot."
Minna (IX),"Sedate and archaic, a twilight-frilled haze
Walks over the meadows like rolled-out centuries
Quivering in sprightly welcome.
Trees pushed down by silence;
Trees lolling in comely abandon;
Trees pungently flamboyant,
Their leaves spinning in the wind’s golden elusiveness.
Trees probing the shrilly sensitive sunset
Like little, laced nightmares leaning
Upon a scarlet breast;
Trees sprinkling their stifled mockery
Upon the blue tomb of the air;
Trees, are you silenced beings
Whitening into the winding paradise
Of old loves seeking a second death?
And has this archaic, twilight-frilled haze
Moulded me to your semblance?","Sedate and archaic, a twilight-frilled hazeWalks over the meadows like rolled-out centuries. Quivering in sprightly welcome. Pungently flamboyant."
Ka ‘Ōlelo,"O ke alelo ka hoe uli o ka ‘ōlelo a ka waha.
The tongue is the steering paddle of the words uttered by the mouth.
                                                      – ‘Ōlelo No‘eau
‘ekahi
Think of all the lost words, still unspoken,
waiting to be given use, again, claimed,
or for newly born words to unburden
them of their meanings. There are winds and rains
who have lost their names, descending the slopes
of every mountain, each lush valley’s mouth,
and the songs of birds and mo‘o, that cope
with our years of slow unknowing, somehow.
It was not long ago that ‘ōlelo
was silenced, along with its dying race,
who lived, then thrived, reverting to the old
knowing words. English could never replace
the land's unfolding song, nor the ocean’s
ancient oli, giving us use again.
‘elua
Like the sea urchin leaves, pimpling its shell
as its many spines let go, turn to sand,
my great-grandfather’s Hawaiian words fell
silent, while his children grew, their skin tanned
and too thin to withstand the teacher’s stick,
reprimands demanding English only.
The law lasted until 1986,
after three generations of family
swallowed our ʻōlelo like pōhaku,
learned to live with the cold, dark fruit under
our tongues. This is our legacy—words strewn
among wana spines in the long record
the sand has kept within its grains, closer
to reclaiming our shells, now grown thicker.
‘ekolu
Ka ‘ōlelo has a lilting rhythm
arising from the coastal mountains’ moans
as they loosen their salted earth, succumb
to the ocean and its hunger for stone.
It carries the cadence of nā waihī,
born from the fresh rain in nā waipuna
and flowing past the fruiting ‘ulu trees,
wiliwili, kukui, and koa.
It holds the song my grandfather longs for
most, as he remembers his father’s voice,
and regrets not asking him to speak more
Hawaiian, so that he may have the choice
to offer words in his inheritance,
knowing his ‘ohā will not be silenced.
‘ehā
Think of all the old words that have succumbed,
their kaona thrown oceanward for English
words we use like nets to catch the full sum
of our being, finding too little fish
caught in the mesh, even as we adjust
the gauge, reshaping them to suit our mouths.
I must admit I love the brittle crust
my only tongue’s foreignness forms; it crowns
the dark, churning pith of prenatal earth
rising in the volcano's throat, unspoken
for now, founding my wide island of words.
And kaona, a ho‘okele’s current,
circles during my wa‘a’s slow turn inward,
steering my tongue through each old word learned.
‘elima
As the ‘ape shoot, whose delicate shoots
shoot forth their young sprouts, and spread, and bring forth
in their birth, many branches find their roots
in the dark, wet ‘ōlelo the earth bore.
My unripe tongue taps my palate, my teeth,
like a blind ko‘e that must feel its way
through the liquids, mutes and aspirates of speech,
the threading of breath and blood into lei:
“E aloha. ‘O wai kou inoa?”
I ask, after the language CD’s voice.
“‘O Kekauoha ko‘u inoa,”
my grandfather answers, “Pehea ‘oe?”
So, we slowly begin, with what ‘ōlelo
we know; E ho‘oulu ana kakou.","The tongue is the steering paddle of the words uttered by the mouth. There are winds and rains who have lost their names, descending the slopes of every mountain, each lush valley’s mouth."
Star-Spangled Banner,"A betrayal
to stand
with your hand
over your heart
and sing
the song
of the country
occupying
your country
to read every star
on the flag
above
your country’s flag
and see the last one
there: small, white
and pointed
stitched into the blue
with a thin thread
as if
it has always
been that way
as if
it can never
be undone.","A betrayal is a betrayal to stand with your hand over your heart and sing the song of the country. A betrayal can never be undone. The flag is small, white, pointed and pointed."
This Island on Which I Love You,"And when, on this island on which
I love you, there is only so much land
to drive on, a few hours to encircle
in entirety, and the best of our lands
are touristed, the beaches foam-laced
with rainbowing suntan oil,
the mountains tattooed with asphalt,
pocked by telescoped domes,
hotels and luxury condos blighting
the line between ocean and sky,
I find you between the lines
of such hard edges, sitting on
the kamyo stool, a bowl of coconut,
freshly grated, at your feet.
That I hear the covert jackaling
of helicopters and jets overhead
all night through our open jalousies,
that my throat burns from the scorch
of the grenaded graves of my ancestors,
the vog that smears the Koʻolaus into a blur
of greens, that I wake to hear the grind
of you blending vegetables and fruit,
machine whirl-crunching coffee beans,
your shoulder blades channelling ocean,
a steady flux of current.
Past the guarded military testing grounds,
amphibious assault vehicles emerging
from the waves, beyond the tangles
of tarp cities lining the roads, past
the thick memory of molasses coating
the most intimate coral crevices,
by the box jellyfish congregating under
ʻOle Pau and Kāloa moons, at the park
beneath the emptied trees, I come
to find you shaking five-dollar coconuts
(because this is all we have on this island),
listening to the water to guess
its sweetness and youth.
On this island on which I love you,
something of you is in the rain rippling
through the wind that make the pipes
of Waikīkī burst open. Long brown
fingers of sewage stretch out
from the canal, and pesticided
tendrils flow from every ridge
out to sea, and so we stay inside
to bicker over how a plumeria tree
moves in the wind, let our daughters
ink lines like coarse rootlets
in our notebooks, crayon lines
into ladders on our walls
and sheets. Their first sentences
are sung, moonlit blowhole plumes
of sound that calls pebbles to couple,
caverns to be carved, ʻuala to roll
down the hillside again, and I could
choke on this gratitude for you all.
This island is alive with love,
its storms, the cough of alchemy
expelling every parasitic thing,
teaching me to love you with
the intricacies of island knowing,
to depend on the archipelagic
spelling of you lying next to me,
our blue-screen flares their own
floating islands after our daughter
has finally fallen asleep,
to trust in the shape and curve
of your hand reaching out to hold mine
making and remaking an island our own.","On this island on which I love you, something of you is in the rain rippling through the wind that make the pipes burst open. I come to find you shaking five-dollar coconuts, because this is all we have on this island, and I listen to the water to guess its sweetness and youth.

Paradox,"I know you love me better, cold—
Strange as the pyramids of old,
Responselessly;
But I am frail, am spent and weak
With surging torrents that bespeak
A living fire!
So, like a veil, my poor disguise
Is draped to save me from your eyes’
Deep challenges.
Fain would I fling this robe aside
And from you, in your bosom hide
Eternally!
Alas!
You love me better cold,
Like frozen pyramids of old,
Unyieldingly!","I know you love me better, cold. I am frail, am spent and weak. With surging torrents that bespeak                A living fire!"
Fr**dom,"ignites in me plenitude
that scents rain. Sense
the sky is full of surprising
music. Timpani, trumpet
a blue tent torn that orders
cogent, cumulative event in which no false intonation
claims itself king
over all. Every last woman
man, and child proof the rain falls
never to be worn out
Freedom is the breaking point beyond rage
I’m not scared and I don’t care where the dream
undertakers have warned me not
to take too much, not to
love too much, not to look too closely at the past,
What could there be left to break?
Nothing left to be broken
Nothing left to be taken.","Freedom is the breaking point beyond rage. I’m not scared and I don’t care where the dream is. Timpani, trumpet, blue tent torn that orders."
Mourning Birds,"Here a thousand birds dispute
The gun going off
the random back fire
who handled who
and who rose to be recognized
and how the body came to be fresh
fallen there
and why the girl was tacked
and how her wrists looked slight in hand cuffs
and the exact nature of the orange pin
and the load glassing her eyes
the load incalculable and
the incalculable load.
Here a thousand birds dispute
the fresh blood on the sidewalk
the battle line, how it was drawn
how the sides were chosen
had there been a trial
Or any doubt and if so
how it was framed
did the shot hang in the air and who
was there to hear it, and here
Hold this thought—4 are shot per day
As xenon follows its element
Or night its day time shadow
As penumbra fades into solids
and endures a rain of blows
—there falls a reign of blows
Here a thousand birds dispute
What went wrong
the stopped clock
the orange pin
the random call
the fall from childhood
the fall, the incalculable fall,
the fall incalculable
this time to not let the familiar
obsequies masking obscenity
twist lips, the birds dispute
these too, the televised worship of cinders is riveting
junk heartache abetted by hollow gestures
The birds’ disputations grow louder
frantic against glass
stunned splintered and hushed,
in shadowy, honeyed innocence
The gun going off
The random back fire…..
appears as random as asking
who’s got the gun
who owns the gun
who sold the gun
who pulls the gun
and who does the gun let sleep.","Here a thousand birds dispute the random back fire of a gun that went off in a shooting range. The gun went off at random, and the shot rang out in the distance. A thousand birds were shot."
Meditation in the Open-Air Garage,"Leaves have no choice
but to articulate the wind:
aspens like zills, aglint and atilt;
the willow, a lone zither.
Riffling the cottonwoods at dusk,
winds find me cushioned against
the concrete in the open-air garage,
facing the trees, the drive, the road,
the mountains up the canyon’s
other side, until an onrush bellows
a mindless heartless ecstasy
through the empty sack of me.","Winds find me cushioned against concrete in the open-air garage,facing the trees, the drive, the road, the mountains up the canyon’s other side. Leaves have no choice but to articulate the wind:aspens like zills, aglint and atilt; the willow, a lone zither."

They are not wisdom

They are not what’s lost.
They are nothing but wild geese.

wings pushing down metaphor.
  Late Spring
Does spring start grieving
in April or May? Once each
spring, the girl appears
in the white house behind mine.
The window opens.
The girl paces, phone to ear.
One day I look up,
the girl is gone, window closed,
and I go back to dying.
  Utterance
Have you ever stood
on a highway in pitch-black
and heard nothing but singing?
  The First Year
The year after death
is full of stretching, where things
pull so hard your bones
break, because they were never
bones, were always solitude.
  Threshold
The crows have lifted
away all the question marks.
They aren’t interested
in finding truth, since they have
already seen our insides.","The Wild Geese are not wisdom or freedom or history. They are not what’s lost. They aren’t interested in finding truth, since they have already seen it."
Memorial Hoops,"The day broke a record for cold, for us wanting
To be anywhere but outside, & it was late
May, the weekend we called Memorial. My mother
Is a veteran, but that is a story for another time,
& we were driving into the mother of rivers state,
My youngest son, named after two men, one who
Turned a trumpet into a prayer, the other who
Before a piano became whatever those who know say
G-d sounds like, me, & friends, who like me, imagined
Watching their sons trade baskets with strangers
Was some kind of holy. Around us was more granite
Than Black folks & I carried Primo Levi’s If This Is a Man
In my knapsack, hesitant to return to all the astonishing
Ways we make each other suffer &, still, somehow,
Survive, & astonished most by how we remember. I’ve
Forgotten my fair share of things that matter. But
Who am I kidding? The weekend was about
Basketball. We’d driven three hours to this colder
Weather. My youngest boy hoped he’d heat up once
A ball touched his hands. Did I say we named the child
After the idiosyncrasies of Jazz, all because as children
I don’t think my wife & I knew enough ambition
To save us from what we’d encounter. These were the days
When he and the nine he suited up with desired
Little more than to hear the rasp of a ball against whatever
Passed for wood in a gym with a hoop. There is something
To be said about how basketball makes men of boys and boys
Of men. The ref who chattered with us parents wondered
Why a cousin the age of the ballers ate chips for breakfast.
The other team had a player who made me think, though
She be but little she is fierce, as she, the only girl on
The court slipped a jewel into that hovering crown
We cheered, even those of us whose boys sought to dribble
& jump shot their way to the glory of a win. & when Miles
Came down as if he knew what would happen. I didn’t hold
My breath. A crossover, the ball then swung around his back,
The kid before him lost on some raft in a wild river. Maybe
He knew the ball would fall true because he turned around
To watch us as much as to get back on defense. We laughed
& laughed & watched as kids barely large enough to launch
all of that need at a target did so, again & again.","Basketball makes men of boys and boys of men, says the author. The writer's youngest son was named after two men, one who turned a trumpet into a prayer, the other who became whatever those who know say G-d sounds like."
Proof,"Proof that we live in a broken world and a broken world is unlivable.
Proof that the carrot turns into the stick and vice versa. Proof that that seems normal, self-sufficient.
Proof that we sometimes destroy things that are broken and can’t be
fixed and sometimes fix things because to live with them broken is
unthinkable.
Proof that we switch roles, sometimes to destroy things that are
broken and can’t be fixed and sometimes to live with things that are
broken because to fix them would be unthinkable
Proof that we learn to live with the unthinkable.
Rectangles in tangerine, orange and persimmon fall into place, take
our names, simulate full hands. Proof that having full hands leaves
no time for questions.
Proof that we can’t help grabbing the sharp end, even when all the
warnings are there.
Proof that we find the hot water, the hot water finds us.
Proof in the tongue of ruin and burn. Fluent in the language of minus.
The trees have fallen and the forest comes apart.
Proof then by reading it on paper. Proof in unmarked bills. Line by
Line our eyes fill up with witness: Morning as clear as glass.
Can stones be far behind?","Proving that the carrot turns into the stick and vice versa. Proof that that seems normal, self-sufficient. We sometimes destroy things that are broken and can’t be fixed and sometimes fix things."

Winter with the Gulf Stream,"The boughs, the boughs are bare enough,
But earth has not yet felt the snow.
Frost-fringed our ivies are, and rough
With spiked rime the brambles show,
The hoarse leaves crawl on hissing ground,
What time the sighing wind is low.
But if the rain-blasts be unbound,
And from dank feathers wring the drops,
The clogg’d brook runs with choking sound,
Kneading the mounded mire that stops
His channel under clammy coats
Of foliage fallen in the copse.
A single passage of weak notes
Is all the winter bird dare try.
The moon, half-orb’d, ere sunset floats
So glassy-white about the sky,
So like a berg of hyaline,
Pencill’d with blue so daintily—
I never saw her so divine.
But thro’ black branches—rarely drest
In streaming scarfs that smoothly shine,
Shot o’er with lights—the emblazon’d west,
Where yonder crimson fire-ball sets,
Trails forth a purfled-silken vest.
Long beds I see of violets
In beryl lakes which they reef o’er:
A Pactolean river frets
Against its tawny-golden shore:
All ways the molten colours run:
Till, sinking ever more and more
Into an azure mist, the sun
Drops down engulf’d, his journey done.","The moon, half-orb’d, ere sunset floats. Glassy-white about the sky, so like a berg of hyaline,                Pencill’s with blue so daintily. I never saw her so divine."

Big Clock,"When the big clock at the train station stopped,
the leaves kept falling,
the trains kept running,
my mother’s hair kept growing longer and blacker,
and my father’s body kept filling up with time.

I can’t see the year on the station’s calendar.
We slept under the stopped hands of the clock
until morning, when a man entered carrying a ladder.
He climbed up to the clock’s face and opened it with a key.
No one but he knew what he saw.

Below him, the mortal faces went on passing
toward all compass points.
People went on crossing borders,
buying tickets in one time zone and setting foot in another.
Crossing thresholds: sleep to waking and back,
waiting room to moving train and back,
war zone to safe zone and back.

Crossing between gain and loss:
learning new words for the world and the things in it.
Forgetting old words for the heart and the things in it.
And collecting words in a different language
for those three primary colors:
staying, leaving, and returning.

And only the man at the top of the ladder
understood what he saw behind the face
which was neither smiling nor frowning.

And my father’s body went on filling up with death
until it reached the highest etched mark
of his eyes and spilled into mine.
And my mother’s hair goes on
never reaching the earth.","When the big clock at the train station stopped, the leaves kept falling, the trains kept running, my mother’s hair kept growing longer and blacker, and my father's body kept filling up with time.

Fog,"between my ribs, fog above the cemetery
where my grandmother

paper airplanes through the walls, above
the defunct train station and the abandoned zoo

fucked in a tiger cage. Fog in my aorta,
in the hearts of squirrels
who lug around acorns too wide for their throats.
Fog in my cheese sandwich. Fog in my underwear
drawer, in my love’s mouth,
inside the watermelon’s
darkest seed. All of us a dream
the La Brea Tar Pits
are having. Fog above the tar
and fog inside the bones
below the tar. My mother mistaking her child
for a spool of fog. My love
catching the fog
as it leaves the champagne bottle.
Fog casting shadows
in three dimensions, but not the ones
that matter.

A Desert Memory,"Lonely, open, vast and free,
The dark’ning desert lies;
The wind sweeps o’er it fiercely,
And the yellow sand flies.
The tortuous trail is hidden,
Ere the sand-storm has passed
With all its wild, mad shriekings,
Borne shrilly on its blast.
Are they fiends or are they demons
That wail weirdly as they go,
Those hoarse and dismal cadences,
From out their depths of woe?
Will they linger and enfold
The lone trav’ler in their spell,
Weave ‘round him incantations,
Brewed and bro’t forth from their hell?
Bewilder him and turn him
From the rugged, hidden trail,
Make him wander far and falter,
And tremblingly quail
At the desert and the loneliness
So fearful and so grim,
That to his fervid fancy,
Wraps in darkness only him?
The wind has spent its fierce wild wail,
    The dark storm-pall has shifted,
Forth on his sight the stars gleam pale
    In the purpling haze uplifted.
And down the steep trail, as he lists,
    He hears soft music stealing;
It trembling falls through filmy mists,
    From rock-walls faint echoes pealing.
Whence comes this mystic night-song
With its rhythm wild and free,
With is pleading and entreaty
Pouring forth upon the sea
Of darkness, vast and silent,
Like a tiny ray of hope
That oft-times comes to comfort
When in sorrow’s depths we grope?
’Tis the An-gu, the Kat-ci-na,
’Tis the Hopi’s song of prayer,
That in darkness wards off danger,
When ’tis breathed in the air;
Over desert, butte, and mesa,
It is borne out on the night,
Dispelling fear and danger,
Driving evil swift a-flight.","The desert is vast, vast and free, with only the lone trav’ler to guide him. The wind has spent its fierce wild wail, the dark storm-pall has shifted. The stars gleam pale and the purpling haze uplifted. He hears soft music stealing; it trembling falls through filmy mists."
Pulling the Moon,"I’ve never made love to a man.
I’ve never made love to a man but I imagine.

                         I imagine pulling the moon.
                         I imagine pulling the moon out of his brow.

Pulling the moon out of his brow and eating it again.

                         Eating and pulling his hair in silence.
A kind of silence when the moon goes out.

When the moon goes back and forth between us.

A kind of silence lit for only a moment.
Seeing for a moment through the eyes of the horse.

                         Through the eyes of the dead horse
                         that burns slower than my hair.

Field Guide Ending in a Deportation,"I confess to you my inadequacies. I want to tell you things I do not know about myself. I’ve made promises to people whom I will never see again. I’ve broken down in an airport bathroom stall in El Paso, TX when immigration denied my father’s application. It felt like a mathematical equation—everything on one side needed to equal everything on the other. It almost made sense to be that sad. I am not compelled to complicate this metaphor. I’m selling this for two dollars. Years ago, on my birthday, I came out to my friends. I thought about the possibility of painting their portraits. What a stupid idea. I’ve started to cover up certain words with Barbie stickers in my journal. It occurs to me, sitting in my car, at a Dollar General parking lot, in search of cheap balloons for a party which I do not care about, that I am allowed my own joy. I pick the brightest balloons, pay, drive home and dress for the party. I mouth the words happy birthday to you in a dark room lit by everyone’s phone cameras. Afterwards, I enter all of my emails from five years into a cloud engine and the most used word is ok. I confess that I have had a good life. I spend many nights obsessing over the placement of my furniture. I give you my boredom. I give you my obligation. I give you the night I danced and danced and danced at a child’s birthday party, drunk and by myself. I’ve been someone else’s shame. It’s true, at it’s core, amá was deported because she was hit by a car. For years to come, this will be the ending of a sad joke she likes to tell. I laugh each time she tells the joke to strangers. Something about how there is more metal than bone in her arm. Something about a magnet. She says I thought I had died and death meant repeating a name forever. She says el jardin encierra la boca de mis pasos. But this is a bad translation. It’s more like I felt like a star, I felt like somebody famous.","Amá was deported because she was hit by a car.

on the Adirondack chair

this morning, that creaks
but still
does hold—
nor the cries of the others
above water, beloved
bright voices of summer
echoing like the ice cream man
in his whirring truck—
along the curb his lights flash
like an ambulance
playing the tune
you cannot name—yet know—
except this babbling, like a light
barely shining,
from below the baby’s cracked door.","Nothing can make, make me want to stay in this world. Not the grass with its head of hair turning grey, not the swayback horse in the field, nor the bent shadows late in the day. Not even the cries of the others, above water, the voices of summer."
Quotidian,"No right is more precious in a free country
than that of having a voice in the election
of those who make the laws under which,
as good citizens, we must live. Other rights,
even the most basic, are illusory if the right
to vote is undermined.
—Justice Hugo Black, 1964
Sometimes she wrote about the weather—
how hot it was, or yet another lightning storm
gone as quick as it came. In the catalog
of her days: a dress she was sewing, car trouble,
pay day, laced with declarations of love
to the man who would become my father—
her body bright with desire, a threshold
I would soon cross into being. Two years
before Loving will make their love
legal, my mother writes about marrying
despite an unjust law; and because it is 1965,
Mississippi in turmoil, she writes about a cross
burned at the church next door, interracial
outings at the beach, and being followed
by police—all of it side by side in her letters’
tidy script. Reading them, I can’t help thinking
how ordinary it seems, injustice—mundane
as a trip to the store for bread. And I know
this is about what has always existed,
side by side, in this country. That summer,
my grandmother brought The Movement
home. It tells the story in pictures, and it is
beautiful, my mother wrote, adding, I think
you know the way I am using the word.
On the cover: a black protestor, caught
in a cop’s chokehold, his mouth open to shout
or gasp for air. Inside, pictures I could not bear
to look at as a child: a man tied to a scaffold,
his body burned blacker, the fire still smoldering
beneath him; two boys hanged from a tree
above the smiling white faces of the revelers
turned back toward the camera: a young couple
holding hands, ordinary as any night out
on a date. Now I think of my mother, in love
and writing love letters, cataloguing her days,
those terrible/beautiful pictures on the table
next to the crocheted lace doily and crystal bowl
my grandmother kept for candy: butterscotch
in cellophane wrappers, bright and shiny as gold.
It is July 20th 1965, two months before my parents
will break the law to be married, and my mother,
who’s just turned twenty-one, signs off—her rights
basic as any other citizen’s—Have to run, she wrote;
Got to get downtown to register to vote.","No right is more precious in a free country than that of having a voice in the election. Other rights, even the most basic, are illusory if the right to vote is undermined."
Beeches,"The forest is its own thanksgiving
Walking a mile or so from the road
Past the lake & ancient post office
I skim the long bodies of the beech trees
The elegant ascension of their slender trunks
A kind of gorgeous illusory play
Of white bars against the dark ochre matting
Of the earth below
Peace is where you find it
As here the last secret of the dawn air mixes
With a nostalgia so perfumed by misery
Only the rhythm of the walk itself
Carries me beyond the past
To say I miss you is to say almost nothing
To say the forest is the sanctuary of ghosts
Is only the first step of my own giving way—
Not the giving up—just the old giving thanks",The forest is its own thanksgiving. The rhythm of the walk itself carries me beyond the past. To say I miss you is to say almost nothing.
The Park,"It was I think a small town in Ohio
I taped to the wall above my office desk the postcard
Of Klimt’s painting called The Park
An example of cliché so profuse it touched my heart
Consoling me each time I turned my glance to its
Storm of tiny moth-sized leaves shimmering over all but the bottom
Ribbon of the canvas where the rows of the trunks individuate
The mass of the pulsing foliage above
A figure in a kimono or a robe so lush it too seems foliate
Stands apart from two other figures similarly dressed
But (the two) huddled closely together & moving off the sheer
Right edge of the canvas
& the solitary figure remains oddly hesitant & indistinct
& pensive although
Perhaps she is simply realizing that she does not wish to go
Where all of the others wish to go",Klimt’s painting called The Park is an example of cliché so profuse it touched my heart. The solitary figure remains oddly hesitant & indistinct although pensive. Perhaps she is simply realizing that she does not wish to go where all of the others wish to.
Without,"The world will keep trudging through time without us
When we lift from the story contest to fly home
We will be as falling stars to those watching from the edge
Of grief and heartbreak
Maybe then we will see the design of the two-minded creature 
And know why half the world fights righteously for greedy masters 
And the other half is nailing it all back together
Through the smoke of cooking fires, lovers’ trysts, and endless 
Human industry—
Maybe then, beloved rascal
We will find each other again in the timeless weave of breathing
We will sit under the trees in the shadow of earth sorrows 
Watch hyenas drink rain, and laugh.","""The world will keep trudging through time without us,"" says the author. ""We will sit under the trees in the shadow of earth sorrows and watch hyenas drink rain, and laugh"""
What the Silence Said,"Do you still believe in borders now?  
Birds soar over your maps and walls, and always have.

travelled on wind you couldn’t see    
                                            wafting over the valley
and up and over the hills and over the next valley and the next hill.
  Did you not hear the animals howl and sing?   
Or hear the silence of the animals no longer singing?   
Now you know what it is to be afraid.  
You think this is a dream?  It is not
a dream.    You think this is a theoretical question?  
What do you love more than what you imagine is your singular life?   
The water grows clearer.  The swans settle and float there.    
  Are you willing to take your place in the forest again?    to become loam and bark
to be a leaf falling. from a great height.  to be the worm who eats the leaf
and the bird who eats the worm?    Look at the sky: are you
willing to be the sky again?  
                                                You think this lesson is 
too hard for you    You want the time-out to end.  You want
to go to the movies as before, to sit and eat with your friends.
It can end now, but not in the way you imagine    You know

can explain everything?    Don’t listen.

Wetback,"After the first boy called me a wetback,
I opened his mouth and fed him a spoonful of honey.
            I like the way you say “honey,” he said.
I made him a necklace out of the bees that have died in my yard.
                        How good it must have felt before the small village
                        echoed its grief in his throat, before the sirens began ringing.
How fallow their scripture.
Perhaps we were on stage which meant it was a show,
which meant our only definition of a flower was also a flower.
I waved to the crowd
like they taught me,
like a mini-miss something.
                                       Thank you.
                                       Thank you.
Yes, I could have ripped open his throat.
I could have blown him a kiss from the curtain.
           I wanted to dance by myself in a dark room
           filled with the wingless bodies of bees—
           to make of this our own Old Testament
with all the same beheaded kings
           pointing at all the same beheaded prophets.
           The same Christ running through every door
           like a man who forgot his child in the car.
But the lights were too bright.
I couldn’t hear him because I wasn’t on stage.
                         I could have been anyone’s idea of pity.
How quiet our prophets.
           Let my bare back remind him of every river he’s swam in.
Miel and miel.
           I pulled the bees off the string
           and cupped them in my palm.
I told him my Spanish name.
There was nothing dry on my body—
The lamps falling over in the dark of me.","I made him a necklace out of the bees that have died in my yard.

If I Should Come Upon Your House Lonely in the West Texas Desert,"I will swing my lasso of headlights
across your front porch,
let it drop like a rope of knotted light
at your feet.
While I put the car in park,
you will tie and tighten the loop
of light around your waist —
and I will be there with the other end
wrapped three times
around my hips horned with loneliness.
Reel me in across the glow-throbbing sea
of greenthread, bluestem prickly poppy,
the white inflorescence of yucca bells,
up the dust-lit stairs into your arms.
If you say to me, This is not your new house
but I am your new home,
I will enter the door of your throat,
hang my last lariat in the hallway,
build my altar of best books on your bedside table,
turn the lamp on and off, on and off, on and off.
I will lie down in you.
Eat my meals at the red table of your heart.
Each steaming bowl will be, Just right.
I will eat it all up,
break all your chairs to pieces.
If I try running off into the deep-purpling scrub brush,
you will remind me,
There is nowhere to go if you are already here,
and pat your hand on your lap lighted
by the topazion lux of the moon through the window,
say, Here, Love, sit here — when I do,
I will say, And here I still am.
Until then, Where are you? What is your address?
I am hurting. I am riding the night
on a full tank of gas and my headlights
are reaching out for something.","I will swing my lasso of headlights across your front porch. I will eat my meals at the red table of your heart. If I try running off into the deep-purpling scrub brush, you will remind me."

Then, maybe, no more fighting

as if it never happened, when Ahmad was burned,
when people were killed, when my cousin was shot.

How much power it doesn’t have—
Thou shalt not kill crumpled under our feet.

And why do they wear camouflage?
We can still see them.
Who are they hiding from?
The guns are bigger than we are.
The tanks are bigger than shrines.

Moon Over Gaza,"I am lonely

I who have been staring down so long
see no reason for the sorrows humans make.
I dislike the scuffle and dust of bombs blasting
very much. It blocks my view.
A landscape of sorrow and grieving
feels different afterwards. 
Different sheen from a simple desert,
children who say my name
like a prayer.  
Sometimes I am bigger than
a golden plate,
a giant coin
and everyone gasps. 
Maybe it is wrong
that I am so calm.","I dislike the scuffle and dust of bombs blasting very much. It blocks my view. I am lonely                for my friends. They liked me,                trusted my coming."
On an Island (New York City),"In the last hour of night, I lean into
a book that multiplies its pages.
A settling and a continuum:
bedding down of a sedentary body
and a story of an expanding universe.
For nearly three months I’ve not walked 
out into the evening, my skin un-kissed 
by summering breeze, wafts of ghost 
fragrances of wisteria and gardenia.
                                          A virus has leapt 
into another species, and a plague roams 
the globe, locking down its best predator.
Health: spatial matter and loneliness.
                            I’m not reading the book, 
thumbing its leafing, fanning pages. 
In bed I prefer to be hostile 
and, rather, host my own 
breathing. In the distance, sirens
like a continuous Nina Simone dirge.
                           As water through granite, 
I let myself dream of an archipelago 
where I began, a scattering both
of isolation and attachment.","The author has not walked out into the evening for nearly three months. In the last hour of night, he leans into a book that multiplies its pages. The book is a story of an expanding universe."

Childhood Elegy,"If our angels hover above us,
they will see a darkening cornfield, the spectral traces
of lightning bugs, and two brothers
lying among the stalks.  
We come because sometimes it is hard to live.
The cornstalks, limp under the tropical sun,
revive in the cool of twilight.
The angels will know we have been here for hours.
They will land and rest their feathers around us
and whisper soothing names of winged things: finch, monarch,
whippoorwill, ptarmigan, Daedalus, Icarus, Gabriel...
The angels will bend down and touch their faces
onto ours and borrow our eyes: Earlier,
a horse slipped, breaking its leg.  
A boy stood beside his younger brother. 
Their father came into the stable, carrying a gun.
Quails flitted out of a bamboo tree; the boy 
traced the trail that had led him here,
the field tilled by the dead horse,
where his brother laid down,
dust on his cheeks.","We come because sometimes it is hard to live. If our angels hover above us, they will see a darkening cornfield, and two brothers lying among the stalks. Earlier, a horse slipped, breaking its leg."
Imagined Love Poem to my Mother from my Father,"My mermaid, I watched you scaling milkfish.
Your hands and arms were silver, 
and your body flecked 
with otherworldly raindrops. 
You were a silver mine to be mined.
Perched on a high branch of your mother's 
mango tree, I saw only a glimmer 
of the blade as you scaled the fish, up- 
and-down strokes, repeatedly, 
gracefully, like an artist whose gift courses 
through her veins.  A strand of your hair 
danced across your forehead, sweat 
trickled down the joyous strained lines 
of your neck, and your breasts, like twin
bells, I heard their transcendental 
sounds.  The glistening, naked 
milkfish escaped the warm Pacific 
for such honor.  Kismet, chosen by Neptune,
it entangled itself on the fisherman's 
net and beckoned you with its fresh, 
clear eyes.  You sliced 
its stomach, sweet blade twisting
in me, scooped out its innards, 
the heart, pulled out the gills
from underneath its head's protective plates.
I almost fell off the tree, there was a deep 
aching in my chest, and my breathing 
was shallow.  Crouched beside the spigot, 
you pumped for water with brisk motions
of your brown arms, cleaning the fish, cradled 
by the softest hands, blood 
and scales streaming onto the earth.
Didn't you hear the fish mouthing my words
as you were salting it: Do unto me, the spy
up on the thick fruit tree, as you have done 
unto the milkfish?  One day I hope 
to recite for you these verses
and in my voice you will hear, 
from across the oceans surrounding
the archipelago, as if reverberated through
the ages, the voice of our future son.","My mermaid, I watched you scaling milkfish. Your hands and arms were silver, and your body flecked with otherworldly raindrops. You were a silver mine to be mined. You sliced the fish's stomach, sweet blade twisting in me."
The Daughter,"1
I witnessed nothing
to speak of because
we were Free.
My life at four was the same
as at three. Then whispers wound
into my ears, or,
Father never whispered–
he gave me fire to breathe–
all the oxygen lit the room,
burning me up until my breath
writhed in the body’s drum.
Nothing changed but my mind.
  2
I have a sense of him having said–
to Mother? a Soldier?–
something, but recall
none of the words,
only a sentence ending,
susurrous, in a hiss.
I froze. Put together
the words were menacing, sneak-
attacks, after which fear
riddled me day and night
like bullets. I have never not lived
with the fact of having heard,
  3
the tear in me trauma
rent when I secreted
zero at the bone.
Father was high up–I never got
his echelon straight before the war
was over–but he was someone
who knew things
done to whom by whom
and when I snuck to the door
to listen the sound words
made was lightning flashed
right into my skull.","At four years old I heard whispers in my father's voice. The words were menacing, sneak-attacks, after which fear riddled me day and night like bullets. I have never not lived with the fact of having heard, having heard the words."

Fancies,"If we could return from our last long rest
And seek out the ones we loved the best,
Though not in a form to cause them fear,

Would we come in the song of the mourning dove
Recalling to them our endless love?
Would we come in the sound of the falling rain
Telling them gladly “We shall meet again”?
Would we come in the silently falling snow
With memories of rosy cheeks long ago?
Would we come in the rainbow or sunset’s hue
Repeating to them “Be true, be true”?
Would we speak in some sad sweet song’s refrain
Bidding them wait in gladness, not pain?
These are but fancies, faint and dim;
For dare we question the wisdom of Him
Who gave us through death the victory sweet
To be with our loved ones in joy complete?","If we could return from our last long rest, we would seek out the ones we loved the best.

Out of the unforgivable wrongs,
Out of the thin, dun soil of my soul—

Tawkwaymenahnah,"I walk around the small tribal
welfare cabin Kookum
had lived in, searching
for her grinding stones.
On hot August days
we would sit for hours grinding
chokecherries, pits and all.
She would hum or sing
softly in Cree, put the mash
into small patties on cookie sheets,
cover them with screens
to keep the birds out,
set them on the cabin’s low roof
to dry in the hot North Dakota sun.
In the dead of winter, she would soak
the dried patties overnight,
then fry them in bacon grease,
add flour and sugar,
the small shack filling with a tangy
sweet scent, and summer
flooded my every pore.
I take my grandkids berry picking,
they complain of heat, mosquitoes, ticks,
twigs catching their braids.
I wear my apron, make a pouch
to pick the low hanging berries
with one hand and toss them in
like Kookum did.
Kneeling before the flat rock,
braids tied back,
smaller rock clasped in hand,
I pound the fresh berries
pits and all.
Grandkids want to try,
and soon the rock is singing
my grandmother’s songs.","Kookum lived in a small tribal welfare cabin in North Dakota. She would spend hours grinding chokecherries, pits and all. The small shack filling with a tangy sweet scent."
It would be water,"how it comes from the sky because I am dry   because
I am thirsty    reaching down for roots I can feel

April poem then I snuck into a little place for pasta   talked
myself into believing I deserved a treat   thinking I was
anonymous   & there was Meena’s husband David with friends
eating & laughing   we greeted awkwardly   I stayed at my
corner table   red wine & rigatoni   all I could think about was
Meena’s thick shiny nearly black hair    how I didn’t manage
to visit her that last year of illness although I said I would
she sent me poem & photo    told about losing her hair
I said it looks beautiful short   that I was thinking of cutting
mine    don’t do it she said    don’t cut your hair then she 
was gone    her photo in my office so anyone who enters 
will know   her poems moving around like waves    tulip 
stems   high pitched elegant voice articulating 
how the world begins & ends     how verse continues

The Door-to-Door Saleswoman,"Look, I’m knocking on your door,
satchel full of flyers for the best subscription
I can offer you—deals for a scholarship
to the school of the world, jars of honey, 
honeysuckle’s perfume, the sky swept
cirrus by big bluestem, the zigzag work
of bees, the four directions of the compass 
signaled by the compass plant, sunflowers’
fix on east, a wind to make a chime 
of leaf stir and branch when ice shackles
the prairie grass—look at its brilliance
flashing as it drips! 
                                   And maybe this 
is a return to my girlhood work,
knocking on neighbor’s doors with deals
for Time and Life subscriptions, scholarship
to the college of my choice, in a town where
Uranium-235 was carefully sorted from U-238
to make the bombs that could blow up our world—
this wish to spend life tending what grows.","The author grew up in a town where uranium-235 was carefully sorted from U-238 to make the bombs that could blow up our world.
