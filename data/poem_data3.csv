2020,"Up late scrolling
for distraction, love, hope,
I discovered skew dice.
In the promotional video
you see only a mathematician’s hands,
like the hands of god,
picking up the dice one at a time,
turning them over and over 
before returning them 
to the hard wood table,
where each lands with something 
between a whoosh and silence,
face up, face down,
some faces lying on their side,
as at other archaeological sites.
I bought a set of the patented dice,
each with its own logic and truth 
and aleatory uncertainty—
at home alone I rolled them
across my dining table
to pass the time, 
and time with its own logic
passed. Dear god.
I haven’t been touched in so long."
Saying of Il Haboul,"Guardian of the Treasure of Solomon 
And Keeper of the Prophet’s Armour
My tent
A vapour that
The wind dispels and but
As dust before the wind am I
Myself."
Disputed Tread,"Where she steps a whir,
Like dust about her feet,
Follows after her
Down the dustless street.
Something struggles there:
The forces that contend
Violently as to where
Her pathway is to end.
Issues, like great hands, grip
And wrestle for her tread;
One would strive to trip,
And one would go ahead.
Conflicting strengths in her 
Grapple to guide her feet,
Raising an unclean whir,
Like dust, upon the street."
Pole| |Sport,"We turn and turn ourselves
Into the question. We turn ourselves against
Its gravity. An axis we defy.
The idea             spun
Current as—:     an absolute
Value, faith presents        a gift
For our unboxing—: between poles.
We are the line women.
Hungry-handed transformers
Handed lightning—: bolts, striking.
Who wants to address     America?
When I stand in               between
Two poles, I am the absolute        value of
The lyric—: I have been
Where she stands.
Between poles she is the determinant
Of—: gravity. A force, she
Stands in| |for
Her own won now. Headline—:
No flag does justice.
She scales the staff
Herself—: unflagging,
She waves."
Curious and Counting,"How do I get in your atmosphere?
Tell me about your signs, look me planetarily
—those Venuses in your eyes?
There was no thought after you
and I wrote it down. Wandered
to the wailing with my back exposed.
My kind of Sunday, your knees
buffalo and kicking up plains.
We go sockless for beauty.
Ribbons unwind bring us to tied,
I’m at your symmetry, remembering
all your digits and your lucky number nine."
The Inflammation,"The air in the high school is swollen. My heart balloons
as I smooth my name tag down. The woman checking
me in at Austin East Magnet High School has a warning,
“They might not have much to say.”
I have not come to measure their verbs or their vowels.
My vested interest is their red blood cells. East Knoxville,
where six students in one year, from one high school,
are dead by gun violence.
As I walk to Ms. Hall’s young writers class, 16-year-olds
with the mud-red beauty of the Maasai fly past me in the
hall late for class. There are no visible signs of bruising.
A blood test could reveal the damage done these last 400
years. A blood test is a fine modern measurement of the
homocysteine levels moving through precious growing
creative bodies. There are no blood tests in my bag and I
only have one hour to measure what I have traveled here
to know. East Knoxville, fifty years before, every grocery
store, bakery, doctor’s office, barbershop, pharmacy, juke
joint, Miss Lucille Reader of Palms, closed down and laid
to rest on the new Civic Center pyre. Blood sugar levels
bought season tickets to the Moon. Families on the East
side came to know American architecture intimately, how
the right side of Martin Luther King, Jr. Boulevard arced
into the halls of the high school, and the left side dangled
at the front door of Jarnigan & Son Mortuary, oldest Black
business in town. A swelling is how the body begins to heal.
A blood test can be historical marker for the inflammation
of disparity. My ballooning heart enters the door of their
A, B, and O world. I am met by 14 framed faces of curious
encyclopedic sunlight. Their Wolof and Benin mouths follow
me around the room like awakened cicadas. I ask them to read.
They stop buzzing, mid-air, hold their patterns, wondering
if I have come to take something else from them. The one
in perfect white sneakers with BEATS dangling off his ears
keeps his head under his hoodie. The two by the window
use the glass as dream portal, watching, then aiming, their
father’s eyes farther out into the rising Blue Ridge Mountain
light settling the pitched roof of Jarnigan & Son. The room
is a clover field of hide, luck, and chance, but the burning
tenderness of their inflammation wants out. Inflammation
is a fight response from the body when the immune system
leaps into action even when there is no visible injury. Angelina
extends her grey tablet out to me. Her dark Motown eyes
begin their return to Earth. I read her poem as if it belongs
in my mouth. Their words reach and ricochet. My immune
system kicks in just as Jamartray decides I might be worthy,
handing me his fragile worry-filled word rope, his mother’s
Lindy Hop, in and out of the Double-Dutch rope of illness.
Shiasia’s spunky Afro-Latin is read with Black girl attitude
kept under my tongue for moments when the fear in their
eyes is molten and strawberry. She cheers. Leonard begins
with a piercing refusal to never be a statistic and ends with
his mother’s double helix—HeLa—never-ending cells of
extraordinary love alighting every face in the room. It is
9:00 am on a Friday morning in East Knoxville. I have lost
my tally and count. The young poets have broken my fever."
I Was Told the Sunlight Was a Cure,"for the cloak of despair thrown over our bright & precious
corners but tell that to the lone bird who did not get the memo
dizzy & shouting into the newly unfamiliar absence of morning
light from atop a sagging branch outside my window—a branch
which, too, was closer to the sky before falling into the chorus
line of winter’s relentless percussion all of us, victims to this flimsy math 
of hours I was told there was a cure for this. I was told the darkness
would surrender its weapons & retreat I know of no devils who evict themselves
to the point of permanence. and still, on the days I want
to be alive the sunlight leaves me stunned like a kiss
from someone who has already twirled away by the time my eyes open 
on the days I want to be alive I tell myself I deserve a marching band
or at least a string section to announce my arrival above
ground for another cluster of hours. if not a string section, at least one
drummer & a loud-voiced singer well versed in what might move me
to dance. what might push my hand through a crowded sidewalk
towards a woman who looks like a woman from my dreams
which means nothing if you dream as I do, everyone a hazy quilt
of features only familiar enough to lead me through a cavern of longing
upon my waking & so I declare on the days I want to be alive I might drag
my drummer & my singer to your doorstep & ask you to dance
yes, you, who also survived the groaning machinery of darkness
you who, despite this, do not want to be perceived in an empire
awash with light in the sinning hours & we will dance
until our joyful heaving flows into breathless crying, the two often pouring
out of the chest’s orchestra at the same tempo, siblings in their arrival & listen,
there will be no horns to in the marching band of my survival.
the preacher says there will be horns at the gates of the apocalypse & I believed even myself
the angel of death as a boy, when I held my lips to a metal mouthpiece & blew out a tune
about autumn & I am pressing your ear to my window & asking if you can hear the deep
moans of the anguished bird & how the wind bends them into what sounds like a child
clumsily pushing air into a trumpet for the first time & there’s the joke:
only a fool believes that the sound at the end of the world would be sweet."
River Roads,"Let the crows go by hawking their caw and caw.
They have been swimming in midnights of coal mines somewhere.
Let ’em hawk their caw and caw.
Let the woodpecker drum and drum on a hickory stump. 
He has been swimming in red and blue pools somewhere hundreds of years 
And the blue has gone to his wings and the red has gone to his head. 
Let his red head drum and drum.
Let the dark pools hold the birds in a looking-glass. 
And if the pool wishes, let it shiver to the blur of many wings, old swimmers from old places.
Let the redwing streak a line of vermillion on the green wood lines. 
And the mist along the river fix its purple in lines of a woman’s shawl on lazy shoulders."
A Flair for Language,"She wasn’t easy, is a thing we say
about someone we love. My father
says this about his mother. Grandmother’s
words could cut you from the far side
of a room, well into her last years.
The expressions on her face were widely
reported. It wasn’t necessarily the content
of the opinion, although, it was sometimes,
but how it was packaged and delivered
to your door. One might say she had a flair
for language, if it was a Trini ole-talking.
Which is why I had little choice but to laugh,
one of the last times I saw her,
lustrous as velvet in her dark brown flesh,
recalling me, under the glare of early dementia,
as a lovely little darkie, in a more fragile
voice than the one bellowing into my girlhood,
Fatty-Fatty-Boom-Boom. Her smile hanging
off the long vowel, like a cat’s tail, upturned
to the moon. You see; it’s a miracle I still love
rhyme, the coincidence of language and time."
By the Lake,"Past years are figures in old glass
wobbly in a lake
wrinkled by a stone.
The lake will settle down
a face will reappear
in a scent of evergreen.
Years are present as noon as now
or in a rippled moonglade night;
they summon shadow as in fragile memory
easy as stepping into a lake
breaking the present mirror.
It is the way events are stored,
they come back twisted
in wrinkles of water
blurred inscapes into today."
Itinerary,"Monologues of white interiors
time-dried of water and wind
crowds gather in history’s emptiness
weightless in the hollows of memory
description without witness
so long ago lost."
Shadow and Light,"Incised in concrete
knife-edged shadow
frond a perfect
arrest of clarity
a palm frond arrow
from a declining sun
shadow and light
lust of epiphany
the illusion that walks
with me on concrete
invisible come-along
shadow and light
epiphany of the shadow
tangible as light palm shape
holds me timeless until
without thinking I pass by
an arrest of clarity held
and released by a declining
sun : step over the shadow
light vanishes a passerby"
How We Lived,"           2017, 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022…
And sparrows unthread nests, bring their young nothing
And shadows best seen inside the pitch of a cave
And three hearts stabbed on a train because of courage
And jacarandas flick cinder and blacken the ground
And the harbor horn is a creature roping hulls to the reefs
And the reefs gleam with chrome and absence
And absence is welcome
The bullet is welcome
The malignant cell is welcome
The gray faces and their merciless tongues are welcome
And a father is reptilian in his regard. And a mother stitches
Her lips like a wound.  And the wound smells of silence and its blaring
And a child lays hands on a mine.  And a man swallows his lies without measure
And a woman is told she is less than him she is less than the bodies left
Behind, less than the unmade, the never-was, the dirt forgotten by the tracks
And I no longer care about the losses. I no longer care if the last 
Bit of bark is stripped from the earth, if the starved possum survives
The road, whether my neighbor coughs blood while she drags off a red
Or the hand turning the knob means me harm. I no longer fear 
The inexorable diagnosis, the oceans rising to such heights
In my dreams they are monstrous but we are all still running 
Towards each other, in this latest hour, refusing to shutter our eyes."
Night of Telescopes,"I have buried my share and hardly anyone knows.
A house must hold ghosts, writing
Names across funereal woods and windows
Good for viewing the lingering past. 
This night of telescopes fixes the cold
October sky—a Saturn so delicate as if
Sketched by moths holding to nearby stones
For their lives. The sutures of the moon drift
Into sharpness and a hand points to the inevitable screen
Another haunt in this dim garden where voices ride
Across pines and the invisible fountain locked
In the same little song. Here is the Sea of Crisis
And I would recognize its expanse anywhere
Having visited often, even beneath my lids when I disappear
At night to visit with a father who no longer knows me
Or the dead who always do, and glow like the rain or a rose
Finished with the business of becoming. I can’t say the worst 
Because I’ll keep living it. Machine of the mind. Belt 
Of the hunter. I can spot his patient blade from either coast—
The one where I drown the one where I love the one
Where I keep rowing through the blaze and the black."
Florida Poem,"After summer rains,
marble thumb snails and beetles
blot the window screens 
with pearl and drone. Gardenias swell,
breathing is aquatic and travel
a long drawl from bed to world.
During drought,
the heat becomes a devil
girl with oven-red lips
who wants your brains puddled
in a brass-capped mason jar,
who wants the silver stripped
from your tongue, the evening pulse
between your legs, yes, she wants
everything from you."
The Function of a Wing,"They arrive as red masked druids, ghost
The edge of the desolate golf course, sandhill
Cranes poised between the tall grass and oaks
Lathered in moss, a fading, this pocket of homes
Long past afternoons of stickball and smoking grills,
Hearts alert to the rhythm of clouds
Despite how loneliness drifts beside us all.
Each day’s arc is a wing, a wish hurling
Across the sky, and also time, because what is the clock
But a ship of travel we must board upon our first breath?
I have read about a girl who pinned her healing to the making
Of cranes, and how they navigate by starlight, instinct, the ancient
Maps scored inside the lace of their bones. They know how to dance.
They arrive as themselves. A newborn will curl around her mother’s
Temples in peace, a place where no harm will descend
in its poisonous light, its cell-stripping forms,
A place of quiet, and journey that is a kind of returning to love."
The Depths of the Grass,"Look, in the early light, 
   Down to the infinite 
   Depths at the deep grass-roots; 
      Where the sun shoots 
In golden veins, as looking through 
   A dear pool one sees it do; 
   Where campion drifts 
Its bladders, iris-brinded, through the rifts 
      Of rising, falling seed
   That the winds lightly scour—
Down to the matted earth where over 
   And over again crow’s-foot and clover
      And pink bindweed
      Dimly, steadily flower."
Corazón in Fall,"People like my poems better when
They are serious and lament the fading
Vessels in my cornea, the fog of days
How I’ll be the last one left on the deck
At the bottom of one of the great oceans.
They don’t want to read about the cure
And how I will never stop listening
To Robert and his lovely sliced mouth
I don’t care how old I get. Poems are like
Fists or lipstick, why waste them on me
Trudging through the park with my free 
Pandora and infectious truths, songs from before the new
Cool kids were born and endless, in the time of disco naps
Delicious chain smoking, the world and its innumerable fires
Then and now and now. A voice bleeds beneath my ribs
Into the rubber-band palms and baby lawns and empty cans
Crammed into the recycling, its triangle logo reminds me of radio
Active garbage buried at the core. We break. We sing the familiar 
Because it feels soft and always. The numbers rise like souls
Flying into the hole no one can see, and did I tell you my arms
Carry decades of lockets shaped like metal hearts, corazones ready
To click open or shut depending on what I can never tell.
There are so many, all that promise and defeat, coiled around
My brittle turquoise view."
Monologue of One Whom the Spring Found Unaccompanied,"It happens, at times,
That the route becomes beautiful
The incline gentle and the landscape rich
And on the heavy air the smell of growing things
We think the secret hidden in the land
Or month or year
Or traced upon the chart by which we go,
But do not tinker so with subtleties
You brush the secret with your hand,
As the arm swings, striding.
Gone, you’ll know how much more real her absence is
With sound of her that’s missing now in every sound
With walk of her that’s missing now in every passer-by
Who speaks incessantly
Speaks of how the buds unfold
Of how these days the twigs are fat
Of how all things begin to bloom
How every god-damned thing begins to bloom."
house hunting as an act of faith,"               in the dream i eat the sirens       my eyes go bloodshot & i start
               speaking     in    decibels    only    squirrels     &    vaginas     can
               hear        everythang emergency             sight of red lights criss-
               crossing makes me have to pee              some part of me always
               leaking: sweat      cherry kombucha        mysterious fluorescent
               discharge       cheap champagne        pain  liquified  &  indelible
               toughens  my  meat            but  just  when  i  think  i’m  inedible
               somebody always        nibbling at my edges        i am the square
               root of what academia alleges            my methodology is breath
               seeking a structure where i can exhale reckless         where fear
               ain’t mudded in the sheetrock & painted milk white         where
               the walls ain’t out to smother me          where the foundation is
               cracked just enough for spirit to seep in           where i can sleep
               amidst a barricade of trees &   quiet parades around the house
               disguised as technicolor sunset        disguised as deer slick with
               fog        disguised as fig bush draped in snow           disguised as
               ancestors dark & bright as—"
[Like the Japanese cherry blossoms wedded to the soil’s palm],"Like the Japanese cherry blossoms wedded to the soil’s palm
planted in front of the train station; or the yellow-black dance
of the tiger swallowtail’s wings as it flees; or the echoes that follow
after I thunder loud against the kitchen cabinets; or the summer fire
hitched to the air we breathe—the chuckle of ash sneaking into our lungs;
or the way your eyes elope when you’ve had enough of my
tit-for-tat-I’m-right-your-wrong song; or wind—always, there is wind—
that kicks the kink of the whine and wail of the German shepherd left behind;
or the night’s bat wing splashed against the living room window
as I sleep on the couch; or the final five-hundred pairs of northern spotted owls
married to the asylum of pine and bark and nest and play in the State we claim,
the owls now near-threatened with their thirteen hoots and barks and whistles,
with their shabby dresses and dark-in-love stares, their piece of the American pie—
don’t they, too, deserve the kickshaws of what this handsome planet
has to offer, don’t we? . . . Don’t leave me. We may not be a pair of owls
nested in the forest of Douglas firs trying to make muss a home
humans made of this land, timber harvestings and land conversions.
I may have farmed a muck of our land, too,
but Babe, no matter the season of fresh lavender and children playing
in the hallway, no matter the bowls of leftover ramen mean with age,
no matter the abysmal cycle of lists I conjure in this poem, no matter
if every last owl has escaped—Lord, let them escape—the foul-fowl lust
of humankind, no matter the huff I hang on your every word,
I love you. You are where I belong."
Fracture,"When the grizzly cubs were caught, collared, and taken away—
relocated they call it—
their mother ran back and forth on the road screaming.
Brutal sound. Torn from her lungs. Her heart,
twisted knot, hot blood rivering
to the twenty-six pounding bones of her feet.
Just weeks before
I watched a bear and her cubs run down a mountain
in the twilight.
So buoyant, they seemed to be tumbling
to the meadow,
to the yarrow root they dug, rocking
to wrest it from the hard ground, fattening for winter.
They were breathing what looked like gladness.
But that other mother . . .
Her massive head raised, desperate to catch their scent.
Each footfall a fracture in the earth’s crust."
You remember the feeling but not what made you feel that way,"We get used to trash along the road 
or don’t even have to get used to it 
but then some kids put their beer cans 
on the tips of small trees trying to come up. 
Little star. Now I know the cancer 
is in my body and always will be. 
Still, we can convince ourselves 
of anything. When Bea wants to play, 
that’s what I do. She gets under the covers 
and pretends to be part of my body. 
We tell her daddy she’s gone, 
but she’s right there. I say 
this is just me."
Sun to Void,"I cannot help my gaze
and did not choose this.
I was a flurry of atoms.
I was a disassembled spark.
I desired impression.
I desired progeny.
Then the Lord said unto me:
Suppose a daughter.
Does it please you?
Immensely. Immeasurably.
But I was not myself a daughter,
could be no mother of one or three.
So I was given all daughters.
All blooms, all fruits.
At first, I was a lamp
craned above a clovered garden.
The roots, they suckled the dirt,
and lashed it, and crawled for eons.
Then they were standing upright
all over the earth.
My gaze horizoned.
My origination fogged.
My eyes searched forever,
my gaze compassing.
I asked God to turn me a way,
give me eyelids, give me veil.
Give me some cover, like every other.
God, please. Please ease me, God
until God grew weary of my weary
and fixed for me an axis.
God said: Wait. Repeated: Wait.
I gave you daughters on daughters.
Are you not pleased?
I do not know pleasure.
I know not what I become.
God said: Your touch
is incomprehensible.
Now you know Me.
No fathom between us.
All men turn their faces to you,
but verily, they turn a way.
They tarry home."
Summer Wind,"It is a sultry day; the sun has drunk
The dew that lay upon the morning grass;
There is no rustling in the lofty elm
That canopies my dwelling, and its shade
Scarce cools me. All is silent, save the faint
And interrupted murmur of the bee,
Settling on the sick flowers, and then again
Instantly on the wing. The plants around
Feel the too potent fervors: the tall maize
Rolls up its long green leaves; the clover droops
Its tender foliage, and declines its blooms.
But far in the fierce sunshine tower the hills,
With all their growth of woods, silent and stern,
As if the scorching heat and dazzling light
Were but an element they loved. Bright clouds,
Motionless pillars of the brazen heaven—
Their bases on the mountains—their white tops
Shining in the far ether—fire the air
With a reflected radiance, and make turn
The gazer’s eye away. For me, I lie
Languidly in the shade, where the thick turf,
Yet virgin from the kisses of the sun,
Retains some freshness, and I woo the wind
That still delays his coming. Why so slow,
Gentle and voluble spirit of the air?
Oh, come and breathe upon the fainting earth
Coolness and life! Is it that in his caves
He hears me? See, on yonder woody ridge,
The pine is bending his proud top, and now
Among the nearer groves, chestnut and oak
Are tossing their green boughs about. He comes;
Lo, where the grassy meadow runs in waves!
The deep distressful silence of the scene
Breaks up with mingling of unnumbered sounds
And universal motion. He is come,
Shaking a shower of blossoms from the shrubs,
And bearing on their fragrance; and he brings
Music of birds, and rustling of young boughs,
And sound of swaying branches, and the voice
Of distant waterfalls. All the green herbs
Are stirring in his breath; a thousand flowers,
By the road-side and the borders of the brook,
Nod gayly to each other; glossy leaves
Are twinkling in the sun, as if the dew
Were on them yet, and silver waters break
Into small waves and sparkle as he comes."
Notes from a Pioneer on a Speck in Space,"Few things that grow here poison us.
Most of the animals are small.
Those big enough to kill us do it in a way
Easy to understand, easy to defend against.
The air, here, is just what the blood needs.
We don’t use helmets or special suits.
The Star, here, doesn’t burn you if you
Stay outside as much as you should.
The worst of our winters is bearable.
Water, both salt and sweet, is everywhere.
The things that live in it are easily gathered.
Mostly, you can eat them raw with safety and pleasure.
Yesterday my wife and I brought back
Shells, driftwood, stones, and other curiosities
Found on the beach of the immense
Fresh-water Sea we live by.
She was all excited by a slender white stone which:
“Exactly fits the hand!”
I couldn’t share her wonder;
Here, almost everything does."
"[The Image, as in a Hexagram:]","The image, as in a Hexagram:
The hermit locks his door against the blizzard.
He keeps the cabin warm.
All winter long he sorts out all he has.
What was well started shall be finished.
What was not, should be thrown away.
In spring he emerges with one garment
and a single book.
The cabin is very clean.
Except for that, you’d never guess
anyone lived there."
"[Whenever I Make a New Poem,]","Whenever I make a new poem,
the old ones sound like gibberish.
How can they ever make sense in a book?
Let them say:
“He seems to have lived in the mountains.
He traveled now and then.
When he appeared in cities,
he was almost always drunk.
“Most of his poems are lost.
Many of those we have were found in
letters to his friends.
“He had a very large number of friends.”"

Dakota Homecoming,"We are so honored that
             you are here, they said.
We know that this is 
             your homeland, they said.
The admission price
             is five dollars, they said.
Here is your button
            for the event, they said.
It means so much to us that 
            you are here, they said.
We want to write
           an apology letter, they said.
Tell us what to say."
Covalent Bonds,"we are
dream carriers
child bearers
those burdens borne
with hope
and intensity
under the gravity
of responsibility
history and
love
not guilt
love
and hope
for those who
will dream
and share
these burdens born
we do not give up
willingly
but attract and repel
balance and share
stronger
in that bond of
love"
Wicaŋhpi Heciya Taŋhaŋ Uŋhipi,"(We Come from the Stars)
Stellar nucleosynthesis.
That explains 
where everything
in our universe
came from according to astrophysicists who 
only recently discovered the cosmological constant causing
the expansion
of our universe.
Our creation story tells us we came from the stars to this place Bdote
where the Minnesota and Mississippi rivers converge,
our journey along the Wanaġi Caŋku, 
in our universe,
that stargazers later called the Milky Way now disappearing 
in the excessive glow of a million million urban uplights. 
The original inhabitants of this place,
of our universe,
we are Wicaŋhpi Oyate, People
and will remain here as long as 
we can see ourselves 
in the stars."
Reconciliation,"translated by Babette Deutsch and Avrahm Yarmolinsky
(To My Mother)
A great star will fall into my lap. . .
We would hold vigil tonight,
Praying in languages
That are carven like harps.
We would be reconciled tonight—
So fully God overwhelms us.
Our hearts are only children,
Eager for weary-sweet slumber.
And our lips would kiss each other,
Why are you fearful?
Does not your heart border upon mine—
Your blood always dyes my cheeks red.
We would be reconciled tonight,
If we clasp each other, we shall not perish.
A great star will fall into my lap.
    Versöhnung 
  Es wird ein großer Stern in meinen Schoß fallen. . .
Wir wollen wachen die Nacht,
In den Sprachen beten,
Die wie Harfen eingeschnitten sind.
Wir wollen uns versöhnen die Nacht— 
So viel Gott strömt über.
Kinder sind unsere Herzen,
Die möchten ruhen müdesüß.
Und unsere Lippen wollen sich küssen,
Was zagst du?
Grenzt nicht mein Herz an deins— 
Immer färbt dein Blut meine Wangen rot.
Wir wollen uns versöhnen die Nacht,
Wenn wir uns herzen, sterben wir nicht.
Es wird ein großer Stern in meinen Schoß fallen."
"awaiting a carriage, any","it’s the numerous letters the magnolias make
as they open—one, then another, and then
a letter i don’t quite know yet—that makes any wounded
heart seem more wounded and, despite its chances,
not worth the time. i thought i’d be used to it
by now. i stood in the greening field, i famously
like to recount, and waved my arms
so i could, at last, be claimed, be carried away.
but nothing good descended. no avian form,
no cloud, just a swarm of blue things:
flung twilight, withdrawal, an opal blame.
  sure, i’ve been lonely before, i always say, but not
like this. you have to survive the bad season
to make it to the season of reversals, the magnolias
leading the fray. though that’s not
what we call it, at least not where i’m from
where there is a single, impenetrable era
that begins just as soon as it ends."
The Sunset and the Purple-Flowered Tree,"I talk to a screen who assures me everything is fine.
I am not broken. I am not depressed. I am simply
in touch with the material conditions of my life. It is
the end of the world, and it’s fine. People laugh
about this, self-soothing engines sputtering
through a nosedive. Not me. I’ve gone and lost my
sense of humor when I need it most. This is why I
speak smoke into a scene. I dance against language
and abandon verse halfway through, like a broken-
throated singer. I wander around the front yard,
pathless as a little ant at the tip of a curled-up
cactus. Birds flit in and out of shining branches.
A garden blooms large in my throat. Color and life
conspire against my idea of the world. I have to
laugh until I am crying, make an ocean to land
upon in this sea of flames. Here I am.  
Another late-winter afternoon,
            the sunset and the purple-flowered tree
trying their best to keep me alive."

Not,"after Adrianne Lenker
I was supposed to be writing you back
I was supposed to be describing my desires
The moment I plugged my ears, not the clouds on the ceiling
How the heat doesn’t burst
Where you sheered the gap with your thighs, a black skirt
A glossy rainbow beetle eating a lanternfly
A wasp displaced from the splintered wood door
How rain flattened the sky
Blank lightning scorching the undone bed
My chest flat with bones which don’t die
Bones, which persist like hair, inanimate, as stones persist
Mostly green indifferent appetites
When the animal god dies it’s spoiled with worms
When anger reaches its iron tongue inside it burns
I used to get off on a small, concentrated sensation
It took years to undo the glue of experience
It’s a big gap for mood
It’s a dark stripe in the darkness
It’s how I remember nothing in particular
Tracks of metal gridding the street
How a body could produce an iron nail if iron in blood assembled
I didn’t think I came but I must have
How angry it made me, the indignity of not touching
The gauzy light on a woman’s face, her idle desires
Compared to the way we fit two hands inside, hungry
How indifferent to particular folds of skin
There was a bottomlessness to the negations
Whatever it was burning gold inside a ring of nots
I, untied, dispensing promise
A commitment of green circling green only
Not what you might think, a hawk in the dead tree
A velvet rope cordoning
Nothing eventful happened so I forgot it
That’s how life moving through space works
Comparing the size of palms, smoothness of thighs
Caught in a loop I knew from history
Not capital, not significant, of a personal nature
A solemn quality of knowledge, what others might call god
Hair collected in an archive versus
Hair drawn in a long strand from one’s crevices
My horoscope says to do the smallest thing possible
The trees say indifferent rattle in the wind
This was life, normal, tidal, I considered it
The dead papering the street with their notices"
The Story of Everything,"dad?
yes, my love
where do we come from?
and we come from all of this
this is a story about a time
a time of strange times
what happened during the Big Bang?
what came after our Sun and planets were created?
throughout the first nano nano nano milli centi second of this Universe
that’s when this story takes shape
in the valley of our birth place
and we cried out to the Universe that we were here
that we were here
and we were many
so many
trillions upon trillions upon trillions
so countless and beautiful
every atom of carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, and phosphorous that makes up our bodies was forged in stars
and as the world continued to change
we evolved our ways
we honor the ancestors and the elders
we pass on the knowledge from generation to generation
maybe we go cyborg
incorporating technology into our skin, bones, and brains
if we all had biological Bluetooth, USB, or WiFi, 
i could’ve just beamed this presentation to y’all
it’s hard work up here you know
there will be the pulling and pushing of emotions
there will be laughter, and tears, and everything in between
for all the racism and hatred that the color of our skin has produced through the history of
our humanity, and for all the conflict that exists even till this very day
it all comes down to vitamin D
if we held hands for a moment and listened
we could become the power of love
the power of unity
and the power of understanding
we gathered together as a community in peace
we showed the universe how great we could all be
if we just sat and listened to the music
if you happen to be down to help create a global self-sustaining reality,
imagine the impact we could have
because the moment we perfect this
the moment we get this
we all win
together
game on
because energy is the currency of the universe
tonight, I want you to think about your life
and go out there and live it
Hānau ka iʻa hānau ka Naiʻa i ke kai lā holo
this is our chance to write our own history
do we destroy ourselves?
or do we take care of ourselves
and give our species the best chance of making it to the future unscathed?
the time to listen to each other has just begun

At Sainte-Marguerite,"The gray tide flows and flounders in the rocks 
Along the crannies up the swollen sand. 
Far out the reefs lie naked—dunes and blocks 
Low in the watery wind. A shaft of land 
Going to sea thins out the western strand. 
It rains, and all along and always gulls 
Career sea-screaming in and weather-glossed. 
It blows here, pushing round the cliff; in lulls 
Within the humid stone a motion lost 
Ekes out the flurried heart-beat of the coast. 
It blows and rains a pale and whirling mist 
This summer morning. I that hither came— 
Was it to pluck this savage from the schist, 
This crazy yellowish bloom without a name, 
With leathern blade and tortured wiry frame? 
Why here alone, away, the forehead pricked 
With dripping salt and fingers damp with brine, 
Before the offal and the derelict 
And where the hungry sea-wolves howl and whine 
Live human hours? now that the columbine 
Stands somewhere shaded near the fields that fall 
Great starry sheaves of the delighted year, 
And globing rosy on the garden wall 
The peach and apricot and soon the pear 
Drip in the teasing hand their sugared tear. 
Inland a little way the summer lies. 
Inland a little and but yesterday 
I saw the weary teams, I heard the cries 
Of sicklemen across the fallen hay, 
And buried in the sunburned stacks I lay 
Tasting the straws and tossing, laughing soft 
Into the sky’s great eyes of gold and blue 
And nodding to the breezy leaves aloft 
Over the harvest’s mellow residue.
But sudden then—then strangely dark it grew. 
How good it is, before the dreary flow 
Of cloud and water, here to lie alone 
And in this desolation to let go 
Down the ravine one with another, down 
Across the surf to linger or to drown 
The loves that none can give and none receive, 
The fearful asking and the small retort, 
The life to dream of and the dream to live! 
Very much more is nothing than a part, 
Nothing at all and darkness in the heart. 
I would my manhood now were like the sea.—
Thou at high-tide, when compassing the land 
Thou find’st the issue short, questioningly 
A moment poised, thy floods then down the strand 
Sink without rancour, sink without command, 
Sink of themselves in peace without despair, 
And turn as still the calm horizon turns, 
Till they repose little by little nowhere 
And the long light unfathomable burns 
Clear from the zenith stars to the sea-ferns. 
Thou art thy Priest, thy Victim and thy God. 
Thy life is bulwarked with a thread of foam, 
And of the sky, the mountains and the sod 
Thou askest nothing, evermore at home. 
In thy own self’s perennial masterdom."
A Poem for Maunakea,"we understand
that light travels at almost 186,000 miles per second—which is really fast
almost instantaneous the small distance between you and i
but when we look at objects that are really, really, really far away 
it takes a certain amount of time for that light to reach our eyes
and so we’ve realized 
that when we look up into the night sky
the light from the closest star took 4.2 years to reach us
so when we look at that star, we are seeing it how it was over 4 years ago
but most stars are even farther away, 
their light traveling for hundreds or thousands or millions or billions of years for us to witness
and so when we look at the stars
we are seeing them how they were when our ancestors roamed this earth
so, in a very real way, when we look up to the sky,
we are peering through a portal to the past
it is the closest thing we have 
to time travel
but the thing is
there are billions and billions of stars that we can’t even see with our naked eyes 
so sometime in the 1600’s
we figured out how to build telescopes to see them
to see billions of years into our universe’s past with even more clarity
sometimes we need  a little something extra to see more clearly
which brings us to today
where some of us are proposing to build the Thirty Meter Telescope, or the TMT, on Maunakea in Hawai‘i
but you see the TMT is more than just a telescope…
it’ll be one of the biggest telescopes humankind has ever built
18 stories tall with a footprint of 5 acres
providing 12 times more clarity than the Hubble space telescope 
to give us the ability to focus even better on the earliest moments of our universe
so we can tell the story more clearly 
on how we got here
but even more important than that,
is that the TMT is more than just a telescope…
it’s that something extra that we needed to help us see more clearly
it’s a catalyst that has awakened a movement
that has provided us the ability to see with more clarity Hawai‘i’s past
the ability to focus even better on the earlier moments of our nation
so we can tell the story more clearly 
on how we got here
you see the TMT is more than just a telescope…
it’s a time travel portal to the past…
it’s a time travel portal to ‘Iolani palace, a sacred, stolen land where an indigenous people stood to protect our government from being illegally overthrown by treasonous businessmen in the 1890’s
it’s a time travel portal to Kaho‘olawe, a sacred, stolen land where an indigenous people stood to protect one of our islands from being bombed by the United States government in the 1970’s
it’s a time travel portal to Maunakea, a sacred, stolen land where an indigenous people have stood, 
and continue to stand, kū
to protect, kia‘i
our mountain, mauna
kū kia‘i mauna, from further desecration and environmental degradation 
it’s a time travel portal to the same story of broken treaties 
and broken trusts
told and retold and retold 
around this globe 
through the hoarse voices of indigenous people
but this time, we stand while the world is watching…
there are other places that the telescope can be built, you know
other places where the science will be the same
top of the list is the Canary islands in Spain 
and we understand
that science is science no matter where it takes place 
and the secrets of the universe will be revealed to us through a TMT in Spain
so if you find yourself in the pro-TMT on Maunakea camp,
please understand
that we do not understand 
your reasons why…
is it about the money? 
the money?! 
really?!! 
the small pittance in rent that Hawai‘i’s colonizers will charge per year 
plus the promise of jobs, jobs, jobs for people mainly not from Hawai‘i 
and tax revenue that will benefit… who, and how many?
how much money do you need to gain to outweigh the pain of the thousands of us who agree that this sacred, stolen land is not for sale? 
how many times must we all bear witness to the same abuses before we break the cycle?
our ancestors used to look up at the stars, too, you know
they used the stars as a road map to figure out where they had been
and where they were navigating to
and so when we stand at the top of Maunakea and look up to Hōkūle‘a,
we are reminded of our portal to the past…
our ancestors sent out the roadmap to protect our land, 
and while that message took over a hundred years to reach us like the stars in our night sky
we can see clearly now,
because sometimes we need  a little something extra to see more clearly
and that is why we kū kia‘i mauna,
why we stand to protect Maunakea "
Motherland,"Ohio is a long legged sister with kin i share eyes with.
Twelfth Street, a ribbon of brown faces peeping from
concrete porches. High laughs on cool June afternoons.
Kentucky frowns at black faces, pulls crying children from
mothers’ laps. She lays waste to the land. In Kentucky i
glide through dusty back roads, navigate Green River
trying to find out if home is lie or truth. Starlings call my
name but the state bird is a woman’s hanging breasts & the
knot that forms near her nipple; the state flower is hate
boiling rage in every pot; the constitution is 12 ways to
destroy every rainbow. Sometimes Ohio calls my name,
my father’s people all melded into the body of a beautiful
woman, her hips shimmying, her finger coaxing, Come on,
come here. But Kentucky, the tree-topped mountains; & Oh
she quiet—She doesn’t even have to speak a word—her
hips wide, her spine curved. She doesn’t even have to turn
around & i know i want her. There is familiarity in her
scars & bruises & in mine too. Maybe she’s frying fresh
sausage from the pigs she’s slaughtered—just for me—can-
ning blackberries for my biscuits. Even when she shrugs &
turns to slap my face, i know she’ll always be there, the
one i can count on to both hurt & heal."
Witness,"I’m convinced that if you could
have seen my grandmother
standing in the doorway
waiting for him to come home from the fields,
if you’d smelled that spectacular evening thick
with sweat & felt the pulsing of the stars, if
you’d borne witness
to the animals’ moans echoing in the holler
that night, if you just could have seen the
hair rise up
on granddaddy’s arm like that, like
offerings to god, when his elbow touched
hers, if you could have seen
her longing dissipate just a little as he came
through the door smelling like a day’s work, you
should have seen them close enough to breathe
the same air while not even touching.
(He smiled at her without smiling.) If you could
have seen them watching me watch them, then
you’d know how much i love you. If you could
have heard her say, You want some supper?
We got pie."
Asking About My Mother,"In the small kitchen, the hog’s head weaves
the gamey scent of death throughout the house.
My grandmother scrapes black hair
from the hog’s pink head with the
sharp blade of her butcher knife. I ask
her about my mother;
I always ask her about my mother. I play
paper dolls under a Formica table with
pearls around my neck & pink lipstick
from my mother’s treasure chest.
My grandmother places the head into the tub & i watch
her hands, wait for her to tell me where my mother’s gone.
My grandmother fills the tub with water.
I hate that she always reminds me of all she’s done for
love. Remember. Remember. Hair. Face. Knife.
She lifts the heavy tub & situates the hog upon
the stove covering all the burners & turns on all the eyes"

His Eye on The Sparrow,"-after hanif
I guess  black  people  can  write  about  flowers  at   a   time   like   this since   every
poem     turns     on     itself.     Starts     one     way     to     end another.     We     see
it     in     nature     too.      How      seed    turns   to
leaf     regardless     of     its     earth     or     the     thought   inside   my    head
blossoms     into     a     hyacinth     with     as     sweet  a     scent.     Even in dreams,
thought’s pretend cousin, I    often  see      Mamie      Till.      She      walks   the
church    aisle  toward her     son’s     body while wisteria bloats the casket’s brim and
papered bougainvillea bracts emerge   from    where    his    eye    once    was.    An
entire   garden from  the  nutrients  of   once human.   And   not   to   mention all
those    awed    birds    that    circle     Emmett’s     pillowed     corpse. So  many   in

God’s descent,  not    refugees    fleeing    his    body    exilic    but    eternity’s
messengers.  We, who pull breath, confuse death’s irony. Whoever dies and is

A Thing That Happened,"“Oh, we had an intruder alert,”
said my fourth grade daughter
when I asked how school was.
She said this
after the usual shoulder shrug and mumble.
My kindergarten daughter sang in, “Yeah,
we did.”
And I keep the car moving forward.
Even though it feels like a bird
just thwapped against a window in my chest
and this car should stop
now.
Over the intercom, the same silver strainers in the ceilings as the school I went to a long
time ago,
a voice will say, “Mr. Snow, please come to the office,”
and what is expected
is that the teacher will sharply walk to the door
and lock it, that every student in the room
will hide, will be unseeable from the block of glass targeted above the doorknob.
My fourth grader
says everyone tried to fit
in the prairie schooner the teacher and her husband built between the two bookcases,
but there wasn’t room so she tried to squeeze herself alone
behind the filing cabinet.
They tell me this
as no big thing.
They tell me this
like it’s line up, single file, quiet down,
hands to yourself, march outside.
They can’t say it
like I do now. They don’t think about it
like it’s a heartbreak
poem,
have no inclination to want to ask the NRA to give one actual moment of silence,
no inclination to know the name of the school secretary in Atlanta who
talked an AK-47 and a gym bag full of bullets
onto the floor, no inclination to think of grade school teachers
laying their bodies over students,
arms out,
lungs pulling in so hard
they could make their backs
as wide
as wings.
It’s my kindergartener.
It’s my fourth grader.
It’s another thing
that happened
today."
Untitled Poem For Sarah,"Every morning you'd think
all the moths would throw themselves
into the Sun.
But they wait
for streetlights
to consume them
in small coughs
of sparkle.
My dear,
my dear,
my dear:
I have stopped
listening to my moth soul.
My dear, I am done
tilting at streetlights.
My paper wings soar,
brush
your blazing heart."
The Start,"It probably started
in a whisper, a murmur,
a low tone hardly caught by the papers,
a sticker, a poster,
a brick wall with slogans in fresh, black paint
because
it probably started with a shove,
some bluster, a gunshot,
crushed fingers, it probably started
with a speech that caught the right ears
on an otherwise happy day,
yellow flowers in a wooden stand on the sidewalk,
red apples, radio
trying hard to smooth out the mood,
kid hurrying past, thinking,
God, he’s shouting
about me,
pulls his hat low,
it probably started
with another man
drunk on swagger,
it probably started
with a small crowd
coaxing exciting lies,
it probably started
with a neighborhood’s head bowed
as the drone grows each day
(though they’ll claim
it came
in a quick, monstrous surprise)."
At The Corner of New Orleans and Frontier - At Disneyland,"Under Old West guitar and Jazz band trumpet,
where the riverboat steam horn blares,
you order a corn dog.
Beignets and étouffée
are down the way, cowboy,
you don’t have to put up with that.
But the sun dips into everybody’s eyes,
strollers full of screams rock by
and you
start searching, at the popcorn cart and in your life,
for something more
than everything
you’ve been settling
for."
Camelot,"One summer
he came back
to my mother’s mother’s
house, missing a finger.
He and my grandmother
drank Old Crow for hours,
swiveled in the torn white
vinyl seats in her kitchen,
forearms draping the edge
of her glass-topped table.
I’d asked what happened,
eyeing the empty near his pinkie.
He said while sleep on the tracks
a transit train ran over this hand.
He was able to pull back—mostly—
all except for the ring finger,
which sat under a rail in Metuchen.
My grandmother inched in, offered:
So what, Sonny, you holdin’
whiskey like a man ain’t
lost a damn thing.
He laughed like royalty
at court, head thrown back.
Turned toward me to change
subject, asked if I had a bike.
Said he saw some kids
on Stuyvesant ridingbadass
10-speed name brands.
I declined. He warned best to
want than refuse what’s free.
Told me to expect one,
like other kids, on Christmas.
His eyes seemed clouded, though.
Squinty. He kept blotting his fore-
head with a torn paper towel.
The hand with one finger gone
missing—kept scratching, tugging
at his face, his arms, his legs--
where my grandmother’s cat,
Camelot, rubbed against
my father’s hems revealing
a pair of mismatched socks:
one white with his blood
seeping through the ankle
the other, brown & unclean."
Rose Song,"Plant, above my lifeless heart
   Crimson roses, red as blood.
As if the love, pent there so long
   Were pouring forth its flood.
Then, through them, my heart may tell,
   Its Past of Love and Grief,
And I shall feel them grow from it,
   And know a vague relief.
Through rotting shroud shall feel their roots,
   And unto them myself shall grow,
And when I blossom at her feet,
   She, on that day, shall know!"
"I Go Back to Myself, April 2014","And every time, I say this is the last time, now
that we know what travel can grift from the body.
She is naked as I am now, but drunk. In bed.
The place dark, the bamboo blinds like split brooms.
A few weeks before, he’d slipped in using his key,
skittered the dog waiting at the top of the stairs,
watered the mums he’d left on the counter,
put away the wine. He doesn’t mention
coming to the room and she can’t remember.
But this night, every courtesy is whittled
to her littlest part, its radical pink, for once,
indistinguishable from everything: darkness;
his shirt; singed mothwings splayed
on the lampshade like pencil shavings;
wet receipts stuck to the bottom of the vase.
Persephone emerged each spring with the inventory
of her kingdom still clinging to her ankles,
and there were whispers that she grew to love
what we never wanted: swollen Easter fruit, 
its uninvited flesh blue as the vein
bisecting the corridor of my inner thigh.
Each time I go back, I want to sit
with the body. I want to say, “One day you’ll fold
into nights devoid of liquor and lose the taste.
Your joints will ache; your body will try to leave
in ways only your ancestors understand.”
I never think to tell him, “Stop”; tell her “Wake up.”
She’s still afraid of other women, endings, and the dead.
And so I leave, but with the door ajar
as if to say, “Beloved, what has happened
to me shouldn’t happen to you. But until
it does, there is nothing I can tell you.”"
Daytona 500,"Where we’re from, we know ballet as Dale Earnhardt
gliding through the traffic of Daytona; we know dance
as our hands moving across a table of drunk Miller Lites.
This is universal because I say it is. When my mother called
me Kayleb for the first time, I remembered the haunted house
on Clifton Hill, how she was tugged away by a hired actor.
I screamed until they took us out the fire escape. To care
is to call a name. To care is to call your mother’s name,
as your father pulls at her ankles. Dear Ma, you know your
hands were always too blue in the winter, strapping snow
chains onto the Ford Expedition. This is a happy memory
because it’s a memory. It is warmer now. Blame global
warming, blame the divorce. It doesn’t matter. All that
matters is the heat of the sun, and both being here to feel it."
The Understudy,"Even in California
all of my friends require touch    
to get through winter.                
It’s true, I am waiting to be in love          
in front of the people I love.       
He says, I’m glad you’re here                       
& I want to cover his mouth
to warm my hands.        
Of course I understand              
how one would mistake
that earthquake for a passing train
but what do we do with the stillness                    
when after great change             
nothing moves, but his hand      
sliding a glass of wine
across the table
instructing me to drink              
with a single nod.
I bring the glass to my face                     
but don’t let a drop pass my lips.
Beside him, I am almost somewhere        
I’d like to be for a while.
To make him smile        
I tell him I am bad at sex.
To make him kiss me
I tell him when I’m happy
I go looking for things
I haven’t lost yet."
Rememory,
Give Me a Boat That Can Carry Two,"See there, the grapes
in the bowl you threw
with your own hands against
the wheel turning anti-clock
wise, at rest on the granite
countertop—first the globes’
gloss will corrode and the air
will spin a fine white cotton
to shroud it into dust—
The quarried stone counter
also marches slowly
to dust. Today, outside
the sky and sea both share
a dark blue-grey stoneware—and this,
this is how you love:
as the crescendo of morning’s bright,
its silver spears, diffused
through a veil, as the kiss
of grape-skin against
lilac glaze, even,
until from the dark
that formed you, you hear
that whisper call you back
to purple wideness, and you return
to the wheel to practice
giving shape to one vessel
that can hold another,
that can feel it pulse
and then slacken."
Cape Cod,"The low sandy beach and the thin scrub pine,
The wide reach of bay and the long sky line,—
           O, I am far from home!
The salt, salt smell of the thick sea air,
And the smooth round stones that the ebbtides wear,—
           When will the good ship come?
The wretched stumps all charred and burned,
And the deep soft rut where the cartwheel turned,—
           Why is the world so old?
The lapping wave, and the broad gray sky
Where the cawing crows and the slow gulls fly,—
           Where are the dead untold?
The thin, slant willows by the flooded bog,
The huge stranded hulk and the floating log,—
           Sorrow with life began!
And among the dark pines, and along the flat shore,
O the wind, and the wind, for evermore!
           What will become of man?"

My Hero,"(To Robert Gould Shaw )
Flushed with the hope of high desire,
    He buckled on his sword,
To dare the rampart ranged with fire,
    Or where the thunder roared;
Into the smoke and flame he went,
    For God’s great cause to die—
A youth of heaven’s element,
    The flower of chivalry.
This was the gallant faith, I trow,
    Of which the sages tell;
On such devotion long ago
    The benediction fell;
And never nobler martyr burned,
    Or braver hero died,
Than he who worldly honor spurned
    To serve the Crucified.
And Lancelot and Sir Bedivere
    May pass beyond the pale,
And wander over moor and mere
    To find the Holy Grail;
But ever yet the prize forsooth
    My hero holds in fee;
And he is Blameless Knight in truth,
    And Galahad to me."
Chaucer,"Gone are the sensuous stars, and manifold,
Clear sunbeams burst upon the front of night;
Ten thousand swords of azure and of gold
Give darkness to the dark and welcome light;
Across the night of ages strike the gleams,
And leading on the gilded host appears
An old man writing in a book of dreams,
And telling tales of lovers for the years;
Still Troilus hears a voice that whispers, Stay;
In Nature’s garden what a mad rout sings!
Let’s hear these motley pilgrims wile away
The tedious hours with stories of old things;
Or might some shining eagle claim
These lowly numbers for the House of Fame!"
The Negro Soldiers,"These truly are the Brave,
These men who cast aside
Old memories, to walk the blood-stained pave
Of Sacrifice, joining the solemn tide
That moves away, to suffer and to die
For Freedom—when their own is yet denied!
O Pride! O Prejudice! When they pass by,
Hail them, the Brave, for you now crucified!
These truly are the Free,
These souls that grandly rise
Above base dreams of vengeance for their wrongs,
Who march to war with visions in their eyes
Of Peace through Brotherhood, lifting glad songs,
Aforetime, while they front the firing line.
Stand and behold! They take the field today,
Shedding their blood like Him now held divine,
That those who mock might find a better way!"

The Rubinstein Staccato Etude,"Staccato! Staccato!
Leggier agitato!
    In and out does the melody twist—
Unique proposition
Is this composition.
    (Alas! for the player who hasn’t the wrist!)
Now in the dominant
Theme ringing prominent,
    Bass still repeating its one monotone,
Double notes crying,
Up keyboard go flying,
    The change to the minor comes in like a groan.
Without a cessation
A chaste modulation
    Hastens adown to subdominant key,
Where melody mellow-like
Singing so ’cello-like
    Rises and falls in a wild ecstasy.
Scarce is this finished
When chords all diminished
    Break loose in a patter that comes down like rain;
A pedal-point wonder
Rivaling thunder,
    Now all is mad agitation again.
Like laughter jolly
Begins the finale;
    Again does the ’cello its tones seem to lend
Diminuendo ad molto crescendo.
    Ah! Rubinstein only could make such an end!"
[I seek for rhythmic whisperings],"translated by Babette Deutsch and Avrahm Yarmolinsky
I seek for rhythmic whisperings
Where noises bandy—
For life I listen wistfully
In footless banter.
I cast wide nets and tentative
In lakes of sorrow.
I go toward final tenderness
By pathways sordid.
I look for dewdrops glistering
In falsehood’s gardens.
I save truth’s globules glistening,
From dust-heaps garnered.
I fain would fathom fortitude
Through years of wormwood—
And pierce the mortal fortalice,
Yet live, a worldling.
My cup, through ways impassable,
To bear, untainted;
By tenebrous bleak passages
To joy attaining."
from “Consequences upon Arrival”,"We woke into the morning undressed. Every thought washed of color and their chains rusted over. 
Our certainty absorbed into forms of circulation. Plasma-rich consistencies. Or spittle. It was difficult to make out the occasion. Or to whom we owed the honor. 
No one suffered a wound. Nor suffered without good reason. The occasion filled to capacity our uncharted, elemental mouths.
  //
  The only meaningful thought tore itself from the valley. Meaning thirst increased. Flooded dwellings and crevices of pain. 
The pain that was simple. Fundamental as the air before rain. 
The circumstances formed around our suffering decayed from the point of initiation inward. This so abandonment became common. 
We trained our ears to wake and comprehend the hour. Deliver oxygen. Rest one foot in its light.
  // 
  We rose our heads only to say, fuck learnedness. Behavior that could only exist in the mouth acquired by failure. 
Articulate and reform the needle drawn up into the roof of its suffering. 
We weren’t coming back—not one night we said—to that disease-shaded landscape. That puss in sheep’s clothing though desire was tied to its awning. 
  //
  Difference presented a sense of direction. Non-glorious. Scars that festered when we did not proceed.
What underpinned the context profited in its depletion. In frequent marshes. 
Trust, it’s one true follower. 
  //
  Undressing was performed in accordance with regularity. Its networks regulated and perverse, context required no record. Met us squarely in our eyes. 
The eye that awned. 
The loud immeasurable eye. 
The eye hugging the feet of our failure required collaboration 
that could only be offered between streams. Or given in the rivers that fed themselves.
  //
  We woke with dreams pulled through fine intelligent mesh. 
An intelligence that aged gracefully, like iron. Hardly undone. Such were the overwhelmed conditions upon which our senses depended. The just barely. 
The thorn a fundamental characteristic of our sides.
We saw history was outlined in our ruin of stitches, appearing despite the context that was their given keloid nature. 
What is a vulnerable frontier. It was important to ask of our musculature seizing.
  //
  Language returned through the appearance of clouds. Furtive, deeply shadowed offering nothing. 
We stood adjacent. Looked up and rubbed our arms. 
While not offensive, it’s inappropriate to remain in the procession and offer nothing. Not shade nor rosettes. No part in restoring the fence. Neither the most obvious: rain. 
We should start a committee, someone said. THE COMMITTEE TO END LANGUAGE THAT DOES NOT OFFER RAIN, of which the goals and bylaws were as heart-felt as they were without collective teeth. 
  //
  We woke to vandalization relative to the committee. 
Someones it seemed, were, in their quiet nighttime way, against what they interpreted as the public shaming of non-productive existence. And for the first time in memory, accountability was on the table. It was bulbous and moist. It absorbed all of the blame which was not at all called for. 
It said I have introduced ideological context.
I ruined the stitches. 
I don’t feel seen. 
I’m absorbed by failure. 
I drink from the river and feel nothing. 
My gaze depletes. 
It is me to whom you owe great honor."

“Uvalde Shooting Highlights Role of Doors in Security Plans”,"—AP News headline
The teacher remembers pulling the door
closed. She thought the door
would lock because that door
is always supposed to lock. The door
failed to lock. They say when god closes a door
the shooter will fire through the door’s
windows. At first they said she left the door
open and the shooter got through the door.
She remembers she had opened the door
to carry in supplies, propping the door
open with a rock. But she closed the door
when she heard the shooter just outside the doors.
I ran back into the building. I still had the rock in the door.
So—I opened the door—
kicked the rock—and then locked the door.
Later, they verified she had closed the door
and the door
did not lock. Later, there will be a closed-door
inquiry at the state Capitol. It’s through the closed door
that all the men with guns will enter. The classroom doors
have windows above the knobs. The glass on one door
shatters from gunfire and a man walks through the door-
frame and fires more than 100 rounds. A thin blue door
connects one classroom to another. He shot the door,
a girl in the classroom tells the 911 dispatcher. Through the door
bullets graze two officers and they retreat farther from the door.
No other men with guns will go near the classroom door
for another forty minutes. They said they needed the door’s
key from the janitor. It remains unclear if they tried the door
to see if it was locked. The girl calls again and watches the door
and covers herself in her dead friend’s blood and this is how the door
between heaven and hell cracks open. The door-
way is a thin blue line. The men with guns unlock the door
and shoot the shooter who shoots back from the closet door-
frame. The governor orders all the schools to check their doors
each week and all the doors everywhere come unhinged and every door
is a door is a door is a door is a door
is a door is a door is a door is a door
is a door is a door is a door is a door."
The Sheaves,"Where long the shadows of the wind had rolled,
Green wheat was yielding to the change assigned;
And as by some vast magic undivined
The world was turning slowly into gold.
Like nothing that was ever bought or sold
It waited there, the body and the mind;
And with a mighty meaning of a kind
That tells the more the more it is not told.
So in a land where all days are not fair,
Fair days went on till on another day
A thousand golden sheaves were lying there,
Shining and still, but not for long to stay—
As if a thousand girls with golden hair
Might rise from where they slept and go away."
The Forest for the Trees,"I have seen a tree split in two
from the weight of its opposing branches.
It can survive, though its heart is exposed.
I have seen a country do this too.
I have heard an elder say
that we must be like the willow—
bend not to break.
I have made peace this way.
My neighbors clear-cut their trees,
leaving mine defenseless. The arborist
says they’ll fall in the first strong wind.
Together we stand. I see this now.
I have seen a tree grown around
a bicycle, a street sign, and a chainsaw,
absorbing them like ingredients
in a great melting pot.
When we speak, whether or not
we agree, the trees will turn
the breath of our words
from carbon dioxide into air—
give us new breath
for new words,
new chances to listen,
new chances to be heard."
Words of Encouragement,"“One must always present something
Among the dying” —W.S. Merwin
When writing poems about extinction
it’s important that you make the poems
deep but uplifting.
Nobody wants to read a bummer poem
about endangered orcas and their dead babies.
Keep it light. Keep it motivational. Encouraging.
It’s important to accommodate your gentle reader.
Don’t say anything about how if you won’t swim in it,
why should they live in it.
Don’t say that. Honesty is offensive
in this day and age. It’s always been offensive.
How else do you suppose we got here?
Maybe, instead of saying something like,
“The orca and salmon are going extinct
because of ordinary greed and apathy,”
say something like, “The noble creature
with his power and grace shall journey away
forever through the portals of time.”
Good taste omits mention of
(baby orcas, abducted to be theme-park clowns—
decades in chlorinated cages, taking their eyes—
how during the capture, so many died.)
Don’t forget to forget what you know
about human cruelty—
how the baby orcas that didn’t survive
had their bellies slit and filled with stones,
then were sewn closed
and dumped into the sea,
to sink into a silence so dark and so deep
public outrage couldn’t reach—
a depth unfathomable as a mother’s grief
too heavy to carry for one day, much less 17*.
Among the dying, shall we pretend
that in the end, we too shall not be listed
among the dead? Yes. Let's pretend,
when writing poems about extinction.
  * This detail is referring to the seventeen days that an endangered Southern Resident orca carried the body of her dead calf on her rostrum for more than 1,000 miles in what the media called a “tour of grief.”"
(A Poem Is a) Naming Ceremony,"What has grown out of what has gone away?
The clear-cut patch has grown larger on the mountain.
The rivers have grown murky with timber trash,

what has gone away. I want to meander and play
and forget myself until I can grow a new me
in place of all this grief—learn the language to see
the cotton wood as kwealich ice, the dancing tree;
the killer whales as quell’ lhol mechen, our relatives
under the sea; the whole glorious landscape
filled with meaning to end my grieving.
When I was young, I was invited to learn
Xwilngexw’qen, the people’s language,
but I said no. I didn’t understand. I thought
I wanted to learn how to be rich. I didn’t know
that the only way to posses all the weather
of the world is by naming it—here is bird song,
here is the kiss of a lover, here is the feel
of cold water at the peak of summer.
I have spent my life with words, trying to name
a hint of what I lost by not learning my language.
Estitemsen. Tu totest sen. Estitemsen.*
  * I’m doing my best. I’m still learning. I’m doing my best."
Tour of a Salmonberry,"A salmonberry is a
luminous spiral,
a golden basket
woven of sunshine,
water, and birdsong.
I’m told that the birds
sing so sweet because
of all the berries they eat,
and that show you
can have a sweet voice too.
In my Native language,
the word for salmonberry
is Alile’. In Sanskrit, Lila means
God plays. Salmonberries
sometimes look that way.
Every year they debut,
spectacular in the landscape,
worthy of their genus name—
Rubus spectabilis, meaning,
red sight worth seeing.
Each drupelet holds a seed
and the shimmering secret
kept by rain—of how to rise,
float above the earth, feel
the sun, and return."
Abecedarian for the Dangerous Animals,"All frantic and drunk with new warmth, the bees
buzz and blur the holly bush.
Come see.
Don’t be afraid. Or do, but
everything worth admiring can sting or somber.
Fix your gaze upward and
give bats their due,
holy with quickness and echolocation:
in summer’s bleakest hum, the air
judders and mosquitoes blink out,
knifed into small quick mouths. Yes,
lurking in some unlucky bloodstreams
might be rabies or histoplasmosis, but almost
no one dies and you
owe the bats for your backyard serenity.
Praise the cassowary, its ultraviolet head, its
quills and purposeful claws. Only one
recorded human death, and if a boy
swung at you, wouldn’t you rage back? Or P.
terribilis, golden dart frog maligned by Latin,
underlauded and unsung, enough poison to
vex two elephants into death but ardent
with eggs and froglets, their protection a neon
xyston. And of course,
yes, humans. Remarkable how our
zeal for safety manifests: poison, rifle, vanishment."
Gestational Size Equivalency Chart,"Your baby is the size of a sweet pea.
Your baby is the size of a cherry.
Your baby is the size of a single red leaf

of What if. The size of Please Lord.
The size of a young lynx stretching.
Heat lightning. A lava lamp.
Your baby is the size of every dream

Cassiopeia on a cold night. The size

is the size of the lie you told your mother
the night before Senior Skip Day, and
also the size of the first time you saw
a whale shark glide by, its gray heft
filling the tank’s window, and also
the size of just the very best acorn.
Your baby is the size of the Mona Lisa.
The size of the Louvre. The size

the first time you rode it that your heart

and you rose and fell with them."
How Becoming a Mother is Like Space Travel,"The astronaut told us
he didn’t look out the window
for eight and a half minutes
as the rocket launched him
beyond our atmosphere.
Terrifying things happened—
ground vanished, boosters
exploded, day became
night—and he did not look.
He was focusing,
he said, on his job.
He was up there
a long time. He learned
to sleep suspended. He learned
how the sunrise looks
when you watch it every morning
from the soft dark mouth
of space. Many things,
he told us, were different
than he’d once expected.
There’s no space ice cream,
he said. That’s a big hoax.
His vision blurred.
His body became a study:
blood, appetite, cognitive function.
He took many pictures.
All of them were beautiful.
None of them showed
what it was like to float.
When the astronaut returned
to earth, more tests were run.
Scientists discovered that
seven percent of his genes
had changed in space.
He left the planet
as himself. He came back
as himself, rearranged."
Anthropocene Pastoral,"In the beginning, the ending was beautiful.
Early spring everywhere, the trees furred
pink and white, lawns the sharp green
that meant new. The sky so blue it looked
manufactured. Robins. We’d heard
the cherry blossoms wouldn't blossom
this year, but what was one epic blooming
when even the desert was an explosion
of verbena? When bobcats slinked through
primroses. When coyotes slept deep in orange
poppies. One New Year’s Day we woke
to daffodils, wisteria, onion grass wafting
through the open windows. Near the end,
we were eyeletted. We were cottoned.
We were sundressed and barefoot. At least
it’s starting gentle, we said. An absurd comfort,
we knew, a placebo. But we were built like that.
Built to say at least. Built to reach for the heat
of skin on skin even when we were already hot,
built to love the purpling desert in the twilight,
built to marvel over the pink bursting dogwoods,
to hold tight to every pleasure even as we
rocked together toward the graying, even as
we held each other, warmth to warmth,
and said sorry, I'm sorry, I'm so sorry while petals
sifted softly to the ground all around us."
Where Do You Go from Tonopah?,"Because the Mizpah Hotel has claw foot tubs,
this is where you stop. This place has its own
ghost, a good story about The Lady in Red.
It’s said she was murdered here, discovered
by her husband in the arms of her young love.
She’d have lived to wear her lace and heels
if it hadn't been for the train being late,
her husband missing his connection, stopping
in for a cold drink, seeing her, seeing him
ascend the steep stairs. In Nevada,
it’s always about trains, drinks, connections
missed and made and wholly imagined.
Because, you’re told, Tonopah is for those
with a thirst for adventure, you venture
into the Long Shot Bar, order steaks,
a fine red wine and, arguably, the best
margarita between Reno and Las Vegas,
listen to some old man chat up the young
couple from Henderson who say this is
the farthest north they’ve been, exploring
their new state, transplants from Atlanta.
The old man says this is the real Nevada,
but suggests they also make Elko, Winnemucca,
decent towns he’s fond of, would live in, given...
And because you love books and the beauty
of dust, you’ll spend hours wandering
the dense aisles of Whitney’s Bookshelf,
where paperbacks are a dollar hardbacks, two.
What you’ll take home is a first edition,
hardback, John Gardner's On Moral Fiction.
Inside is a personal inscription, June 1978.
Bob, it says, keep writing in NYC. Thanks
for all your help these two years in Tonopah.
Best of luck. I’ll miss you here. Love Jack."
Address What Matters,"You know you want Marilyn’s dress.
Not the one your mother wanted, not
the rhinestone second-skin she sang his song in—
Happy Birthday, Mr. President—not that dress.
You want the simpler but also sleekly tight
little thing she wore here, in this Nevada town,
the dress she wore while drinking shots at this bar
in Dayton. Cocktail cherries, halter back.
You want this dress because she wore it here
but also because everyone who watched her
learned of her secret special talent,
how she could wield a paddleball 100 times
and never miss a strike. Her hips, egg yolks sliding
around a big bowl, kept time, and so did the men
who loved her, or wanted to. No one, not even
Huston nor Miller, knew she could do this,
could create this moment of pure carnal joy.
The movie was The Misfits, and you watch it
every year because it matters, Marilyn matters,
this bar where you and your third husband
spend long summer hours—it all matters.
Everyone has a story here, and some
remember Marilyn, or say they do.
If you had her dress, you could be fearless,
could show everyone who’s ever doubted
that you have skill, you can shudder air.
You would move with a ferocious heat
like the dry desert dust, which is where,
when you’re done here, you’re headed, no matter what."
Driving Dad to The Dog Museum,"On cross country road trips, my father sang,
old songs he made us learn at least to hum,
my mother snapping along in the front seat,
their daughter untethered in the back.
He sang Oh, Susanna, he sang There’s a Hole
in the Bucket, dear Liza, dear Liza,
he sang Maybellene (why can’t you be true?),
songs with pet names for all of us.
Today I’ve sprung him from Assisted Living,
a picnic in the park, then the Dog Museum.
I’ll pay to see the Huneck exhibit,
the wood cuts and chairs, admire
the exquisite porcelain Great Dane,
a harlequin. My father’s done well
with his therapy dogs, their soft coats
bring back his days of raising hounds,
a young father, before the suits and ties,
before the suburbs. He loves best the room
which houses the war dogs exhibit,
old Rin Tin Tin and the Yorkie, Smoky.
As we enter the parking lot, circle
for a spot his chair can handle,
he starts to sing, he sings Way Down Yonder
in the Land of Buttons...he sings loudly,
his voice echoes across the lot, reaches
a woman walking her whippet, she’s startled,
the dog turns toward us. My father
ignores the woman, says isn’t that the same dog
your friend had in high school? Wasn’t she the one
who died of a self-inflicted woe?
What happened to her dog? Was he sad, too?
Before I can begin to answer,
my father starts to sing, he sings This Old Man—
knick knack paddywack, give the dog a bone!
This old man came rolling home. By the time
we travel the museum’s ramp, he has sung
all ten verses, and I’m Liza again, mending."
Fireworks,"Pink faces—(worlds or flowers or seas or stars),
You all alike are patterned with hot bars
Of coloured light; and falling where I stand,
The sharp and rainbow splinters from the band
Seem fireworks, splinters of the Infinite—
(Glitter of leaves the echoes). And the night
Will weld this dust of bright Infinity
To forms that we may touch and call and see:—
Pink pyramids of faces: tulip-trees
Spilling night perfumes on the terraces.
The music, blond airs waving like a sea
Draws in its vortex of immensity
The new-awakened flower-strange hair and eyes
Of crowds beneath the floating summer skies.
And, ’gainst the silk pavilions of the sea
I watch the people move incessantly
Vibrating, petals blown from flower-hued stars
Beneath the music-fireworks’ waving bars;
So all seems indivisible, at one:
The flow of hair, the flowers, the seas that run,—
A coloured floating music of the night
Through the pavilions of the Infinite."
Dissent and the Hydra,"“[G]uided by the history and tradition that map the essential components of our Nation’s concept of ordered liberty, we must ask what the Fourteenth Amendment means by the term ‘liberty.’”
—Justice Samuel Alito, leaked draft, Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization
“Early attempts to cope with this vile infection resembled battling the Hydra.”
—Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Shelby County v. Holder
  We turn our collars up against the chill of raw judicial power
The fabulous many-headed snake of the marshes of Lerna
It is said that if one head is smyte, three heads grow
A rancorous national controversy
Of spring-headed Hydras and sea-shouldering Whales
Members of the court split three ways
Gestational age ministers life to this monstrous Hydra
We make a long list of circuit conflicts
To cope with this vile infection
We are a quick child
We expect more from an opinion striking at the heart
Had we as many mouths as Hydra, our answer would stop ’em all
For liberty is a capacious term
A jettisoned framework
An animated hiss and whistling wail
Hydra assailants return every hour
Yet their cuts produce in time a perfect animal
Hubris is a fit word for today’s demolition
Of a deeply rooted right, full of hydras and crocodiles
This scheme of ordered liberty is the Court’s own brainchild
Poison fumes, poisoned blood
In a long constellation
With a few bright stars"

Saturnine,"for Karen Taylor
We cannot feel microbes in the palms of our hands
or hear nanoseconds—we can see the laser slice wind. But 
how it shaves beards remains mysterious.
This talk of science & biologicals & viral crowns  
make old mean men crawl into bowls of cotton 
waiting to be plucked at some point
by cadaver slaves humming Tin Pan Alley tunes.  
What’s a pandemic
but one more mortality wake up call. Tongue dulled by wine salted
and cabbage stews happily forgotten. Buffed shoes shining, not worn.
No more the perfect Windsor Knot because the definition for knot
has swerved from necks to bandages.
If ever we could color the subatomic particles and smash them up
would they look like a Ken Tisa Quarantine Drawing—how that 
could brighten the feet step by step in August air. The summer
feels like a heavy cough that starts in the chest, lingers
until it exhausts patience and runs up through the throat
out into the embracing air carrying all manner of microbes, some
of which or what could possibly infect a city or laugh pyrotechnic

time travel, 
Thirst,"Where broken clouds lay dripping
On the edges of the afternoon
Our footprints littered summer’s beach
Abandoning lying driftwood
Torn pictures old letters and the death-buzz
Of flies against the murderous dunes
Returning was to die of thirst
Or see the sun possessed descend
And dive past wet horizons"
Vortex,"As the wind unscatters me
Spindle hurricanes unwind
Direction from my horizontal eye
Blow down the ocean’s fences
And approach my wreckless remnant
Bones bedenizened by birds:
Or contrive a moment from
Whatever sheaf of breath remains
To edge a word along a wind-left wall."
Spider,"translated by The Friend
It’s a massive spider who can’t move;
a colorless spider, whose body—
a head and an abdomen—bleed.
Today I saw her up close. And with what effort
all along her flanks
her innumerable feet stiffened.
I have thought of her invisible eyes
the fatal pilots of the spider.
It’s a spider that trembled stuck
at the edge of a stone;
abdomen to one side,
to the other the head.
With so many feet the poor thing, she still can’t
work herself out. When seeing her,
stunned in some trance,
what grief this traveler gave me today.
An enormous spider who blocks
the abdomen from following the head.
I’ve thought about her eyes,
considered her numerous feet...
What grief this traveler’s given me today.
    La Araña 
  Es una araña enorme que ya no anda;
una araña incolora, cuyo cuerpo,
una cabeza y un abdomen, sangra.
Hoy la he visto de cerca. Y con qué esfuerzo
hacia todos los flancos
sus pies innumerables alargaba.
Y he pensado en sus ojos invisibles,
los pilotos fatales de la araña.
Es una araña que temblaba fija
en un filo de piedra;
el abdomen a un lado,
y al otro la cabeza.
Con tantos pies la pobre, y aún no puede
resolverse. Y, al verla
atónita en tal trance,
hoy me ha dado qué pena esa viajera.
Es una araña enorme, a quien impide
el abdomen seguir a la cabeza.
Y he pensado en sus ojos
y en sus pies numerosos...
¡Y me ha dado qué pena esa viajera!"
Gitanjali 60,"On the seashore of endless worlds children meet. The infinite sky is motionless overhead and the restless water is boisterous. On the seashore of endless worlds the children meet with shouts and dances.
They build their houses with sand, and they play with empty shells. With withered leaves they weave their boats and smilingly float them on the vast deep. Children have their play on the seashore of worlds.
They know not how to swim, they know not how to cast nets. Pearl-fishers dive for pearls, merchants sail in their ships, while children gather pebbles and scatter them again. They seek not for hidden treasures, they know not how to cast nets.
The sea surges up with laughter, and pale gleams the smile of the sea-beach. Death-dealing waves sing meaningless ballads to the children, even like a mother while rocking her baby’s cradle. The sea plays with children, and pale gleams the smile of the sea-beach.
On the seashore of endless worlds children meet. Tempest roams in the pathless sky, ships are wrecked in the trackless water, death is abroad and children play. On the seashore of endless worlds is the great meeting of children."

Virgin voyage: first attempt, initial foray. A suite of lexemes, including virga, a strip of wood, and vireo—green, flourishing, or fresh. Split at the root: she is fresh. She is new and unspoiled. She is insubordinate, impertinent, rude. Virgin, when said of wool: not yet, or only once, spun or woven. Said of olive oil: first press. Said of metal: made from ore by smelting.

N 49° 43´ / W 53° 53´,"Just off Joe Batt’s Arm. Nadia’s on the bridge, and you bring her the new calculations. Narrow nightwatch nigh the ship’s head while she tossed close to cliffs. She gestures for you to sit, tells you things—drugs they can grow, remedies, interactions, techniques. There are more men than women of working age on board. While she talks, she oversees the change of watch, the steady steps along the catwalks and up to the crow’s nests, the gray-clad backs bent over their tasks. The northern sea has begun to roll with more surge and menace, and a layer of chill under the mist clings to the mouth and nose, undercold. No icebergs to worry about anymore. She tells you that the continental currents are uncertain, as are the depths. Crispin has another bellyache. Some crew sweeps up a grainy spill on the deck below, and she stops to write a note. She looks up as if she has news and explains that the females of only two species undergo menopause. That is, the females of only two species outlive their capacity to reproduce: humans and killer whales. Experience in cessation: the females stop having young, then they lead the pod, carry knowledge of navigation, food supplies, routes."

Economies of Scale,"You’ll get used to it, Val. Count containers

divides the risk and limits the loss—auto-
motive to tilapia to zucchini, bay to bay, 
tier to tier, starboard to port, let’s say 
I love you a bushel and a peck: proportionate 
savings in shipping cost are gained by 
an increased level of production. Go on—
the gangway has 88 steps, like a piano, 
and they drove school buses into the hold 
in the dark, fitted them with bunks. Firms 
cannot realize economies of scale in perpetuity.
You do what you have to do. Make rooms 
in it and coat it with pitch inside and out."
Ripples,"I trace back the paths that I’ve chosen to take
Only to realize they were not choices,
Just ripples on a lake
Originating from a single cast stone
That was a stupid mistake made on a lonely walk home
And I am sewn together, stitched in a womb
And outward these timeless ripples bloom
Across the lake of my existence
So persistent that my life is an accumulation of choices
Yet I look to these ripples and perceive their voices
Recollections of a mother hell bent on a will
Recollections of a daughter choosing to not fill
The shoes of a misfit mother
I uncover,
I reveal decades of ill given advice
Which was equally ill received
And try to trace back that dreaded stone that I perceive to
Have started it all
Started the cascade of a daughter’s fall
Because the cause is still unknown
Three generations of women unsown,
Related but unknown to each other
I am desperate to escape the ripples of my mother
Just as desperate as she is to escape the ripples of her own
Fighting the ripples that engulf my daily life
To escape the strife that always seems to belong
I wait for the ripples to someday slow, to fan out and release
Me from this curse
But those never-ending ripples seems to grow stronger daily
Instead of just disperse
They engulf me, shroud me, whip me from side to side
I submerge beneath them to where the truth hides
These ripples are the only thing that’s holding us together
So for now at least I’ll pretend to not know better
And go with the flow of the ripples"
Hope 2020,"I tried to write about hope
But wasn’t sure I had the audacity
The pandemic took a toll
And our last president was a fascist
He
Said he did more for Christianity
Than Jesus
And between the BLM protest and right wing hatred we just
Stayed inside and tried to live
Contemplating if loans would be forgiven
To provide a little relief
We were safe at home but had to march in the streets
To beats
Of Black Lives Matter
See I was flattered
To be part of the Healthcare Hero’s
Until I start telling the truth and the death toll added zeros
And zeros
Until the number reached 100000
And still people believed it was a hoax
And wouldn’t wear masks in public places
The deck was stacked against us and the government held
Aces
But they underbid as the death toll continued to rise
But as the number grew there were fewer tears from eyes
Of the privileged
Because big business needed that money
Propaganda had normal people acting funny
Yet still I dared to hope
Until I couldn't breathe as
George Floyd choked and his killer walked the streets free
See
We're going back into summer
But instead of George Floyd the name we will march to is
Daunte Wright
And we again will wear our masks as we continue to fight
Systems of oppression
The National Guards were called and wore bullet proof vest
When we said Black Lives Matter
But were nowhere to be seen when the right wing
Unhinged the government’s seat of power
And the hours
Continued to tick on
525600 deaths but rent wasn’t on
But Nurses were on
The verge of a mental break down every day
Saving lives of the people who claimed don’t tread on me
And yet I say I’m going to write about hope
As a black woman in America it’s impossible not to choke
On the repetitious contradictions
Vaccines vs quarantine things while the seams are bursting
On the national debt
“Make 600 dollars enough” because it’s all you gone get
As you try to survive this crisis
Going hungry while giving the nation its slice is
Your patriotic duty
I’m a poet and I know it sounds looney
That I can’t write about hope
2020 had me riding a high worse than dope
And when I came down it was comparative to death
Knowing that nothing would change
So I inhale and deep breath
And continue to think about hope"
Fragile,"I remind myself that I am not fragile
People will not tiptoe around me
My blackness is on full display
To complement my femininity
I attempted to understand you
I put my heart and mind in your shoes
And now it is pounding out of sync
To the rhythm of my blues
I am not supposed to be fragile
I am not expected to cry
But instead to throw back my shoulders
And hold my head up high
I am not considered fragile
I am the epitome of strength
Careful to not show my emotions
Careful to disregard the length
Of my pain, expected to be perfect
You seldom allowed the privilege of a mistake
I did it all in the right order
You never wondered if it made my mind break
Split my consciousness in two
The black, the female, in addition to
The wife and the mother,
The nurse, the friend,
The sister to a brother
And each title adds a brick to my back
Just as I attempt to swim
I am unable to be fragile
Even though my patience is wearing thin
Of being expected to get over the past
Expected to hide my pain
I pray that if I am reincarnated
Lord please don’t make me a Black woman again
Because I desperately NEED to be FRAGILE
To be handled with tenderness and love
To have my very soul caressed
And be praised as I am capable of
Such amazing and beautiful things
I need to be able to fully experience my pain
Instead of brushing it aside and acting
Like everything is okay
White girls want to be fragile like bombs
Not fragile like the flowers
Black girls aren’t even given the choice
Because our feelings simply don’t matter
We are and were never expected to be fragile"
Martyr,"I don’t want to be a martyr
But I see you calling for my help
Confusion beyond words
I try not to gasp at the wrong conclusions
Cry at our government in rage
Attempt to stay positive on my Facebook page
Because I cannot be a martyr
Although I was trained to be your saving grace
I’ve held hands with the dying
Looked their families in the face
When I say “they’re gone”
Assure them you didn’t suffer
I dare not be your martyr
My youngest would barely utter
Memories of us if the worst were to pass
I’m home praying for help
But my faith won’t last
Because I know I can help you
I know I can give you 4 weeks
I know I’m being arrogant
But in my arrogance at least
I want to help
Powerless is one thing most nurses say they felt
But there are simply no words for this
I’m in my small town living life in bliss
While my counterpart is comforting the dying
Risking her life daily trying
Because she don’t give a damn about being a martyr
This guilty privilege I choose to bear
Sending prayers out to those who will stare
At the face of a stranger as they take their last breath
I’m not a martyr
Therefore I guess I will just sit here and wonder
What I could have done"

Lorca,"   Split ears of morning earth green now,
Love and death twisted in tree arms,
   Come love, throw out your nipple
to the teeth of a passing clown.
Spit olive pits at my Lorca,
Give Harlem’s king one spoon,
At four in the never noon.
Scoop out the croaker eyes
   of rose flavored Gypsies
Singing García,
In lost Spain’s
Darkened noon."
The Locust,"Its hot voice sizzles from some cool tree

It seems to burn its way through the air
Like a small, pointed flame of sound
Sharpened on the ecstatic edge of sunbeams."
Leaves of Today,"Friday afternoon
Sky receding blue out of bounds
Waiting for Melecio
Crow, a stone’s throw
Sound gathers in the branches
Stirrings of consequence
Playground of the kids
Emotions run deep
Spill over unexpectedly
In Houston on business
Buried at work
Magnificence one block away
The time is now
No one is entirely sure
A habit we picked up
While watching shadows move
This side of the globe
Are shadows real?
Or do they merely represent?
The leaves of today
Delight us
Who are only too human not to care"
Poem 333 (allways capitalize the We),"they say a storm is coming.
        I will be scared when the sun is.
        Don’t forget We are miracles please
    Don’t forget We are
            creation’s favorite color of chaos
                carried away with ourselves
                    at 67,000 miles an hour
                        and We
            have gotten pretty good at it
We decipher our location        on this big rock
by looking at flaming balls of gas
                through lenses We make
                by smashing little rocks
and applying fire to them         which We also make
It’s wild y’all
There’s too much
of what We are
to be defined
by what we’re not
    and in our purest moments won’t We get that
            We are the poems they wrote
        We are the fires they danced around
                They passed us down
            from generation to generation
                and we’re here now
                    Isn’t it wild?
how We try and tame it
        Obey your heartbeat
because the other way around doesn’t work
        Forage the darkness for light
because that’s the easiest place to find it
        Pilfer all the joy you can
Stash it in every crevice of this life
                Alan Kaufman told me
            “Do not let the killers or haters win.”
                    Jose Montoya told me
            “We are the ones we’ve been waiting for.”

The Moving Truck Poem,"In the back of the moving truck
                When the door shuts
                                          And it all goes dark
                    And the engine starts
            And the vibrations shake
                Everything that was not tied down properly
Gets jostled
                            As the weight shifts
When the truck leaves
                And some things fall
                        With every turn            And heirlooms break
                That we have held onto                            Because we were supposed to
                    We do not stop moving
            Because we know
            that when we get
            to the new house
            it will be bigger
                    and better
            and more beautiful
            with no cracks in the foundation
            and enough room for everyone
            to sleep peacefully.

"Seed of Mango, Seed of Maize","I saw one of the grandmothers only once
in a photograph.
Short and sturdy she was, a black black Carib
with a forehead wide as the sea
that kisses Port Elizabeth
and a nose broad as the nostrum of Admiralty Bay.
Breathing deeply,
her breath was fume of coconut and allspice,
mango and frangipani,
blackbird and blue sky,
was the isle of Bequia.
She conjured a daughter,
then jinxed another,
and they bedeviled five daughters between them,
and I am one of those flying fish.
The other grandmother I composed from myth
and half-told stories.
She was a red red Cheyenne—
scorched earth,
much chased—
sported a thick reed of brain
pulled off from her forehead,
wide as Dakota
before it was north and south.
She hisses warnings across ten, then ten times
ten more years to a son
who reshapes them for me
in my dreams, sometimes in my waking.
As flute, blue maize, dance of the sun, she comes, crow on the wing, singing up the ghosts,
and I am one of those—a ghost, singing."
Langston Won’t Stay In His Grave,"calls me rose of neon darkness, calls him-
self early blue evening, black smoke of
sound. Says we are related, you and I,
reminds me we are wandering in the dusk,
our faces a chocolate bar, facing the night
of two moons. And though I’m a lonely little
question mark, he laughs. Life is for the living
with gypsies and sailors. `Til the old junk man
Death plants your toes in the cool swamp mud,
shake your brown feet, honey. Wander through
this living world—get out the lunch box of your
dreams. Stay awake all night with loving or be
a woman in the doorway. Death don’t ring no
doorbells or say here is that sleeping place as if
it were some noble thing. Think how thin and
sharp the moon is tonight. Don’t mind dyin’,
veiling what darkness hides. Haunt like mystery,
like a naked bone in gumbo. Nod at the sun."
I Never Felt Comfortable in My Own Skin So I Made a New One,"I was on a walk when I was struck by the precarity of the gender that wore me,
which moved my matter, wrote books, and fell in love. as a child, I scoured 
the forest for brittle cicada skins abandoned on trees. husks present differently now
a pair of nylons caught in the thicket, a beak surviving its decomposing bird, 
a mural of George Floyd with a purple cock spray-painted on his beryl cheek.
among these discreet mutilations, I pull a line of thought through flesh 
where a misled margin slept. I was uninhabitable before I snared a man
for his hide. I was not unlike the skin of a drum thriving under a stamina 
that made music of me before I split. you wouldn’t recognize me now
if you saw me in the trees, played out, scattered to the undergrowth. I took a life 
and returned it to scale and membrane. I foraged a life coated in plastic
and mud from the highway overpass. it reeked of wheatpiss and it was mine."
Lineage Anagrams II,"I sit hard down, write down rules, an age of alg-
ebra I will not renounce for any good shake of god’s ale or angle
or some other father. Here’s my noes I mouth to no one but two flies alining,
amounting, in air clear between them is my sliver of grace, élan
for no one, the di pteron fold and again my sliver, this grass, genial
grass I’ve known my whole long life this grass, this green gee glen:
cupping my proclamations I will I will I will, lag and nag,
weren’t those the magic words when cupped, my hands glean
this earth, this earth retraced me my unlearned effort, gin of nil
it wills it wills it wills. Claimant am I who turns turns away, ail-
ing away until the edge is a place I home until I am alien,
a line at the edge of a line, a nile."
from “Consequences of a Heavy Heart”,"The whole time you’ve been writing and thinking ocean because it is unknown, because it’s your life. Because you have the brightest terror, like following a white feather into the street. You want it so badly. Would you call that desire? Would you call it love? When you can’t see your legs because of the dark. But did you want to see what was happening? Every life form skidded by. The human products bobbing and sinking. Was that seaweed, we always said it was. The helicopter above seemed to be going somewhere but then it just cycled around the clouds. You thought of churning butter, street crimes, richness, fame. What small dot were you to the motor in the air, only human because of your lack of grace, your head that needed to be above to live. A shape inside the shapeless. Not able to rid shape. Even when brought under, the shape stays, though flattened. The eel is the snake and the manta ray the bat. Transformations in the underworld proliferate and you are unable to stand on your head or hold your sister. Your skin wears the same dint with cosmetics. Your blink, that fear, displaced, running."
"I, New York","I long to hear the history of ordinary people who populate and recreate all over the NYC subway lines, strung together like beans on a charmbracelet drumming on their worldly advice and late-night distractions,
I smoked an ashtray’s worth of cigarettes, cold and tired and snuffing out the little fire on yellow brick walls baring my bones to the whims of demolition,
I jumped over to Manhattan from Staten Island wishing to be Superman but also making music, yes music, from stretched out lizard skins suspended in animation,
I wiped the hair off my scalp dancing around a hollow pumpkin, swore to the forehead of my German moms that I would be unmarried at 50 or otherwise relocate to a harsher life in Uzbekistan,
I hid behind cardamom, cumin, and Halal-style chicken with my eyes darted thinking about Egypt, and the ABCs of Atlantic Barclays Center, Brooklyn, and a biweekly regular named Catherine,
I drank in a tent in the Q train station at Beverly, never showered but always made time to guide clueless New Yorkers to alternative train service like an MTA angel,
I in a rush to get to a Malaysian restaurant in Chinatown dozed off daydreaming about mushrooms, catfish, silkworms and missed my destination by just one stop; went back the other way and still couldn’t stop dreaming,
I asked for baby formula, bow-legged and inarticulate, full of luck and lice on my silver hair, dashed from one street to the other, filling the night with whispers and threats of self-immolation,
I broke a mirror three years before, and now, feeling the effect of medications, yearned to go back to a more violent time in quiet white rooms praying to another religion mistaken for glued together plastic flowers,
I drank my Vietnamese sweat, turned around when spoken to in God’s language, offered fresh fish, pears, and dried plums on a makeshift altar afraid to blink under oath"
The Treasure,"Mountains, a moment’s earth-waves rising and hollowing; the earth too’s an ephemerid; the stars—
Short-lived as grass the stars quicken in the nebula and dry in their summer, they spiral
Blind up space, scattered black seeds of a future; nothing lives long, the whole sky’s
Recurrences tick the seconds of the hours of the ages of the gulf before birth, and the gulf
After death is like dated: to labor eighty years in a notch of eternity is nothing too tiresome,
Enormous repose after, enormous repose before, the flash of activity.
Surely you never have dreamed the incredible depths were prologue and epilogue merely
To the surface play in the sun, the instant of life, what is called life? I fancy
That silence is the thing, this noise a found word for it; interjection, a jump of the breath at that silence;
Stars burn, grass grows, men breathe: as a man finding treasure says ‘Ah!’ but the treasure’s the essence;
Before the man spoke it was there, and after he has spoken he gathers it, inexhaustible treasure."
Immortality,"To be forever young
and ride like a tipsy Triton
on the crest of a wave
that is just forever breaking. . . .
Days—an eternal dawning
heralded with the fanfare of sun,
Nights—a blaze of glory
the swishing tail of a comet,
Life—an infinite loving
Sweeping to the peak of anticipation
Trembling breathlessly at the brink of realization. . . ."
West Coast Sounds—1956,"San Fran, hipster land,
Jazz sounds, wig sounds,
Earthquake sounds, others,
Allen on Chestnut Street,
Giving poetry to squares,
Corso on knees, pleading,
God eyes.
Rexroth, Ferlinghetti,
Swinging, in cellars,
Kerouac at Locke’s,
Writing Neal
On high typewriter,
Neal, booting a choo-choo,
On zigzag tracks.
Now, many cats
Falling in,
New York cats,
Too many cats,
Monterey scene cooler,
San Franers, falling down.
Canneries closing.
Sardines splitting
For Mexico.
Me too. "
A Birth Mother Wears A Costume Her Daughter Will Never Fit In,"Some thought the mother said taproot
Some thought that woman said resigned
but her daughter mouthed immaculately conceived
Some thought the mother said perdition
Some thought she said hocus pocus
while her daughter wrote parables wrote charms
Some hoped the daughter would say yes, honey
(although they suspected the daughter said wishbone—
knew she would deny everything, slipping into, out of)
Some never understood the daughter’s need
to be alone, her fear of sorcery—they only knew
her as braid of ginger & sea salt
as weightless darling & origami
Some have heard her bark & bark & bark
Some have heard her arrange a resistance"
When Nothing Else Will Do,"I don’t want to pluck my burr from your flesh
nor do I want to be kind Or if I am to be kind
I want to be a kind of chameleon,
                                         night-blue florescent
I want to kill that gnat on the wall
but I don’t want to Hoover under
    our once-bed, site of our rub-a-dub
I don’t want to be a full set
of some starlet’s perfect teeth &
despite having nothing to boost, I want
to walk around wearing only my bustier
    I don’t want to flower unless
I narcissus (and yes,
I will honor—& always—
    my fey black body, our first
delights, and our mournings)
I want to tell your best mother everything:
    that I don’t want you to ever forget
my length of legs, both of my hands just there
I think I want to know what you want
    but, perhaps, I shouldn’t look in that mirror
because
    (& even because is a kind of want) so
just tell me—who have you been reading:
    Kafka Morrison manga for animé?
All I want is for my hair to a n e m o n e—
    & for the not-wanting to go for broke
while I drink honey bourbon and listen
    again then over again— Not A Day Goes By"
Sea Ranch Psalm,"Vast emerald all day,
at dusk the sea turns to ink.
The sky, a bonfire.
Now let it be what it must,
though you will ask, Why? What did I do?
A full moon opens her white coat
to the dark matter of it—
the all-night breathing of sea,
its all-night breaking.
You were given a heart like a busted window,
and through it, arrives the gold
of late summer headlands
and one black marble
salted with constellations.
This man too, his rough hands,
and a dog the color of honey,
beside you at the end of a country.
Already the shadows throw down
their lean graves across the bluffs.
Deer rise up from hunger
and graze under the swerve of bats.
Or so the man must tell you.
Let blindness enter before you can imagine
what will take the place of your dread.
Say it will not be desolate.
Say that even in this new dark,
a sparrow begins its two-note trill
to keep count of the whole
going out, the whole coming in.
Beginning here, you will have to let trust
unfold like a softening seed.
And not just the man’s hands,
but whatever you touch—
you will have to let your fingers need."
Netherland,"Snow a celestial orchard in bloom,
mile after mile of pine and granite
clothed in an empire of silence.
We burned newspapers, a cord of wood, a bed frame
the squatters before us had left.
Mornings, our boots made tracks
beside the split moons of deer, the clawed prints of bear,
even as wind whittled it all away.
Some afternoons, there was sunlight through the windows
and we’d lie inside our zipped-together bags
moving like a legless shadow.
Nights, we heard wolves with the sky inside their throats.
No one but your friend knew where we were,
and he had driven us into the Rockies at dark,
saying, The nearest town is Netherland.
Meaning, you can't rescue astonishment
from a boy and girl lost inside the molten light of desire.
Imagine your first love as a road of crumbs
marking a path back to the awakened whole
and your future
as all the small, invisible hungers of this world      
devouring the trail."
Psalm with Near Blindness,"i.
The world mostly gone, I make it what I want:
from the balcony, the morning a silver robe of mist.
I make a reckless blessing of it—the flaming,
flowering spurge of the world, the wind
the birds stir up as they flock and sing.
Edges yes, the green lift and fall of live oaks,
something metal wheeling past,
and yet for every detail alive and embodied—
the horses with their tails switching back and forth,
daylilies parting their lobes to heat—
I cannot stop asking, Sparrow or wren? Oak
or elm? Because it matters
if the gray fox curled in sleep
is a patch of dark along the fence line,
or if the bush hung with fish kites
is actually a wisteria in flower. Though
even before my retinas bled and scarred
and bled again, I wanted everything
different, better. And then this afternoon,
out walking the meadow together,
my husband bent to pick a bleeding heart.
Held it close as I needed
to see its delicate lanterns,
the shaken light.
ii.
Deer, he says, our car stopped in traffic.
And since I can’t see them, I ask, Where?
Between the oaks, he answers,
and since I can’t see the between,
                                                                I ask, In the dappling?                        
He takes my hand and points
to the darkest stutter in the branches
                                                                and I see a shadow
in the sight line of his hand, his arm,
his blue shirt with its clean scent of laundry,
my hand shading my eyes from glare.
There! he says, and I can see
                                                              the dark flash of them
                                                              leaping over a fence (or is it reeds?),
                                                              one a buck with his bony crown,
                                                         and one a doe, and one smaller, a fawn,
but by then it seems they’ve disappeared
and so I ask, Gone?
and he nods.

"Keep Me, Jesus, Keep Me","Keep me ’neath Thy mighty wing,

Save me, Jesus, save me.
Hear me as I cry to Thee;
Keep me, Jesus, keep me;

Winter is Coming,"De winter days are drawin’ nigh
An’ by the fire I sets an’ sigh;
De no’the’n win’ is blowin’ cold,
Like it done in days of old.
De yaller leafs are fallin’ fas’,
Fur summer days is been an’ pas’;
The air is blowin’ mighty cold,
Like it done in days of old.
De frost is failin’ on de gras’
An’ seem to say, “Dis is yo’ las’ ”—
De air is blowin’ mighty cold
Like it done in days of old."
The Lives of the Saints,"I stand at the kitchen sink, washing wineglasses.
In the fifth century BCE, Heraclitus wrote that the way up
is the way down. Like my five empty bottles of merlot in recycle
and the depression I’d fallen into before quitting my job—
clinical director of the county emergency shelter—
which meant talking to children after their father lit them on fire,
the foster parents forcing them to eat from a dog bowl on the floor
while the biological kids ate at the dinner table.
The saints were all about suffering: scourges, crucifixion, drownings.
Nothing but death led a saint to give up on intercession.
As for me, I’d seen my last four-point restraint of a preteen with HIV,
last feral kid armed with a blade extracted from the pencil sharpener.
Now I look out the kitchen window, remembering this one kid,
her hair a dark forest of perfectly matched firs, her black eyes.
In Catholicism, only an exercise of infallible magisterium makes a saint.
Or to paraphrase Heraclitus, the pope decides if a saint’s way down
is the way up. For ten years, that girl was returned to us after every failed
placement, with a new tattoo or piercing for every john she’d tricked,
only to hang herself on her eighteenth birthday.
It was March, vernal equinox, first day of spring. Emancipated Minor,
they called her at Social Services, meaning no money, nowhere to go.
Did I already say she was extraordinarily beautiful?
Before her, I thought beauty was easy to see. Something the spirit feasted on,
while the saints starved themselves on behalf of the afflicted.
Now I set the wineglasses on a clean towel to dry.
Stare at the plum tree that secretly erupted into blossom overnight.
I still can’t tell you the girl’s name, but I’m whispering it to myself.
She taught me something true about beauty.
It is not just those impossibly perfect stars of petals detonated all at once.
It’s how you see the rain-dark branches when the white lace is gone."
Milk,"Even in the dream, it is long past the possible
when I uncover my breast and hold the baby
close enough to drink. How helpless he is
to resist, helpless as the mind in a deep dream
to stop and change direction. Though, on waking,
the mind remembers our grown daughters
and the room where we sleep, and beyond it,
the outside made white with smoke from a fire.
Remembers, yesterday’s eerie milk-gold light
we walked through, and stopped a moment
beside a baby fox. In the road, wasps lighted on his skull,
their black bodies beading his torn-apart torso,
while gnats and flies sipped at the glistening.
And the work of those winged things seemed a fire
chewing through manzanita and alder,
Douglas fir and cedar, the maggots and flies
and wasps carrying the forest out of the fox,
the way the fire carried the forest out of the world.
You asked then if a mother fox could feel sadness.
And because last night my mind had used a memory
of my body to deceive me, had pressed my son close,
believing if he drank, I could keep him,
I want to believe the dead fox was a twin,
a mirror image following yet behind the vixen,
the way a dream can shadow the mind,
and the mind helpless against our stillborn son
that lives inside my dreams and runs silent
as a wild fox behind our daughters. It was dusk
when we turned to go, so quickly the wasps and flies
rose together, as if the black-and-yellow robes
they carried through the milk-gold light had slipped
from the death they had just been covering. All of us helpless
against the beauty of the hurt world as it burns."
Refugees,"Our lullaby
automatic weapon fire
our teachers
bodies in the streets
our parents
whispered stories of stars
who climbed so high
they fell upward into the sky.
We mounted cliffs to find them
climbed every tree;
the bullets flew through the air
and we dropped
like rocks rolling
across the fat plains.
We left for higher mountains:
north, where white powder
fell from the sky—
a kind of magic, cold and wet.
One brother made a blanket of it,
fell asleep and never awoke,
our parents the stars
looking down in silence
unable to speak
the language."
In the Yellowstone,"Little pin-prick geysers, spitting and sputtering; 
Little foaming geysers, that spatter and cough; 
Bubbling geysers, that gurgle out of the calyx of morning glory pools; 
Laughing geysers, that dance in the sun, and spread their robes like lace over the rocks; 
Raging geysers, that rush out of hell with a great noise, and blurt out vast dragon-gulps of steam, and, finishing, sink back wearily into darkness; 
Glad geysers, nymphs of the sun, that rise, slim and nude, out of the hot dark earth, and stand poised in beauty a moment, veiling their brows and breasts in mist; 
Winged geysers, spirits of fire, that rise tall and straight like a sequoia, and plume the sky with foam: 
O wild choral fountains, forever singing and seething, forever boiling in deep places and leaping forth for bright moments into the air, 
How do you like it up here? Why must you go back to the spirits of darkness? What do you tell them down there about your little glorious life in the sun?"
fire danger high today,"the arms of the bosque form a temple
site a dim sage             sap a gentle
fiery teacher
in yesterday’s burn, the wild flames
jumped the river
danced for acres with ache
as I loaded my car                 in the event
it touches,
to return to this network of trees
(who make way for each other
who weep with wind        for what was blackened)
is to discover a spiral of mulberry
a pocket of decadence
within a realm of filtered light
find me humming through the bush
with a basket      dog paws painted purple
find me whispering to laden branches
beside a yearning
besides,          a small dark-faced bird
ordering “come here”
motioning come here     thumb, two fingers
also purple                 after having been motioned
by a soft breeze
by a silent ask to be unburdened
enjoyed
the tree that bears fruit is not withholding
despite the loss           a shock of death 
reverberating through root system
despite the taking,
mulberry is a generous and hungry lover
glutton for giving         shouting for touch
I want to be consumed          in a way 
that is safe
in a space without smoke
in the shade of a cottonwood
in the slit of the bark"
Language of the Moon,"As a child I wanted as many letters
in my bloodstream as the planet Mercury
would allow and so traveled the city
on buses late afternoons and read all the billboards
high above the streets and byways,
on sides of factories and churches and never
heard the sermons of the displaced
or blustery talk of founding fathers, and saddened
when a route snaked through long tunnels,
and then eased when reemerged
out of the murder of light.
I could feel my veins thicken like the winnings
of a Powerball, and the mystery of women
lounging around a gray-bearded man in a silk
smoking jacket drinking a tumbler of cognac
was like the easeful glide of a narcotic dream.
My mouth puckered whenever lemon-colored
arches appeared five stories above the city
like golden gates to an unforeseen heaven.
As a rule, I never glanced at other commuters
or curators in loosened ties and tuxedos
who clutched brown-papered bottles
and nodded to a stillness as though murdered in a film.
Instead, I glimpsed myself looking out a window,
awed by Cartier timepieces and luxury cars
that asked was I hungry for speed
or ordered me to let my body drive.
I ate advertisements like sea waves eating a coastline,
and though my sense of self was as bruised as a moldy peach,
I learned to infrared my longings from the inside
and to tally my suspicions from a distance, and now,
when I read a newspaper, I flutter like a sparrow
at a birdfeeder, and when language spills out
of my skull like a massive cruise ship docked
and towering over a line of ramshackle huts
on an island whose blessed poor gaze up
as though a locker of dollars fell at their feet,
my brain closes and my veins burst
as if pollinating the white face of the moon."
"How could I have known I would need to remember your laughter,","the way it ricocheted—a boomerang flung 
from your throat, stilling the breathless air.
How you were luminous in it. Your smile. Your hair 
tossed back, flaming. Everyone around you aglow.
How I wanted to live in it those times it ignited us 
into giggles, doubling us over aching and unmoored
for precious minutes from our twin scars—
the thorned secrets our tongues learned too well
to carry. It is impossible to imagine you gone, 
dear one, your laugh lost to some silence I can’t breach,
from which you will not return.

It violates a form.

Lincoln,"                                        I
Like a gaunt, scraggly pine
Which lifts its head above the mournful sandhills;
And patiently, through dull years of bitter silence,
Untended and uncared for, starts to grow.
Ungainly, labouring, huge,
The wind of the north has twisted and gnarled its branches;
Yet in the heat of midsummer days, when thunderclouds ring the horizon,
A nation of men shall rest beneath its shade.
And it shall protect them all,
Hold everyone safe there, watching aloof in silence;
Until at last one mad stray bolt from the zenith
Shall strike it in an instant down to earth.
                                            II
There was a darkness in this man; an immense and hollow darkness,
Of which we may not speak, nor share with him, nor enter;
A darkness through which strong roots stretched downwards into the earth
Towards old things:
Towards the herdman-kings who walked the earth and spoke with God,
Towards the wanderers who sought for they knew not what, and found their goal at last;
Towards the men who waited, only waited patiently when all seemed lost,
Many bitter winters of defeat;
Down to the granite of patience
These roots swept, knotted fibrous roots, prying, piercing, seeking,
And drew from the living rock and the living waters about it
The red sap to carry upwards to the sun.
Not proud, but humble,
Only to serve and pass on, to endure to the end through service;
For the ax is laid at the roots of the trees, and all that bring not forth good fruit
Shall be cut down on the day to come and cast into the fire.

                                           III
There is a silence abroad in the land to-day,
And in the hearts of men, a deep and anxious silence;
And, because we are still at last, those bronze lips slowly open,
Those hollow and weary eyes take on a gleam of light.
Slowly a patient, firm-syllabled voice cuts through the endless silence
Like labouring oxen that drag a plow through the chaos of rude clay-fields:
“I went forward as the light goes forward in early spring,
But there were also many things which I left behind.
“Tombs that were quiet;
One, of a mother, whose brief light went out in the darkness,
One, of a loved one, the snow on whose grave is long falling,
One, only of a child, but it was mine.
“Have you forgot your graves? Go, question them in anguish,
Listen long to their unstirred lips. From your hostages to silence,
Learn there is no life without death, no dawn without sun-setting,
No victory but to him who has given all.”
                                           IV
The clamour of cannon dies down, the furnace-mouth of the battle is silent.
The midwinter sun dips and descends, the earth takes on afresh its bright colours.
But he whom we mocked and obeyed not, he whom we scorned and mistrusted,
He has descended, like a god, to his rest.
Over the uproar of cities,
Over the million intricate threads of life wavering and crossing,
In the midst of problems we know not, tangling, perplexing, ensnaring,
Rises one white tomb alone.
Beam over it, stars,
Wrap it round, stripes—stripes red for the pain that he bore for you—
Enfold it forever, O flag, rent, soiled, but repaired through your anguish;
Long as you keep him there safe, the nations shall bow to your law.
Strew over him flowers:
Blue forget-me-nots from the north, and the bright pink arbutus
From the east, and from the west rich orange blossom,
And from the heart of the land take the passion-flower;
Rayed, violet, dim,
With the nails that pierced, the cross that he bore and the circlet,
And beside it there lay also one lonely snow-white magnolia,
Bitter for remembrance of the healing which has passed."
The Woman Who Wanted a Child,"For a short time I walked the earth as a woman, breathed in the scent of gardenias and gasoline,
made love to a man. We lived in a small house with a narrow staircase leading upwards into nothing;
the second floor was never built. I fed him fresh garlic and parsley from our garden, the smell rising
to the top of the staircase where we made love, knees and ribcages bumping against the ceiling. But
my throat grew dry, my feet stuck in the dust. At night, while he slept, I walked down to the marsh
where the birds gathered to dive for fish, the water wetting my waterless lips, the gentle rocking
soothing the aches in my feet, my arms. Please, I said to the white tern bringing her six little
hatchlings bits of fish guts, you a mother who has so many children, help me a mother who has
none.
The next morning, I woke up vomiting feathers. In a few months, my belly was round and full as a
blowfish and I felt the flutter against my ribcage. I walked down to the banks of the marsh, spread
my legs, and out she came, a pure royal tern, her white feathers beaded with blood. She was hungry
and I had nothing to give her; she would not take my milk. I waded out to find the mother bird on
the other side of the marsh. I cannot help you, she said, I have my own children to feed. So I turned
into a fish. My daughter dove, grasped me in her beak, and swallowed me whole. Now, I live within
her light body. We spend our days upon the high winds, bumping only against the sky. Now, I feed
her."
Holiday,"I spent the Christmas after your death hunched
above a puzzle; it had a thousand pieces,
the unmatched angles of a forest caught by early snow,
bright yellow leaves still clinging to their branches.
The photograph on the box was so clear
I could see each crack of rock, each leaf hung
above the brink of winter. The pieces lay scattered
about my dining room, a mess of white and yellow
waiting for me to set it right, so many thousands
of leaves, so much crumbling. Who could count?
Even a sister, even a wife of ten years
one day gets out of bed and puts on red
either because it’s Christmastime again
or because the black dresses sit unwashed in the laundry
and there’s nothing left to wear. I told myself
the leaves weren’t worth it. I told myself you were just
another falling. I did the laundry every day.
I never solved the puzzle."
Song of the Exiles,"There never was a garden,
only a leaving:
miles and miles
of footprints in the dirt.
In the beginning—
the shattered sun, the wind,
and nothing left but our shadows
sifting through the dust behind us.
When we turned
we did not turn to salt.
When we turned
there was nothing behind us to burn
nothing to return to
though who could blame us for turning,
with only the long days ahead
tongues tripping in the dirt.
They said we didn’t belong.
They blamed us
for leaving the garden
which never was or would be.
Where could we go,
we who had come from nowhere
and hence could not
return?"
Objects in Mirror Are Closer Than They Appear,"Awake again, I find my name as
                                              vanished as a midnight I want
      to salvage. To have those black teeth sinking back

                         the surface of a puddle. Its eyes

Why Adam Sinned,"“I heeard da ole folks talkin’ in our house da other night

I felt sorry fuh Mistuh Adam, an’ I felt like puttin’ in,

Adam nevuh had no Mammy, fuh to take him on her knee
An’ teach him right fum wrong an’ show him

I knows down in my heart—he’d-a let dat apple be
But Adam nevuh had no dear old Ma-am-my.
He nevuh knowed no chilehood roun’ da ole log cabin do’,
He nevuh knowed no pickaninny life.
He started in a great big grown up man, an’ whut is mo’,
He nevuh had da right kind uf a wife.
Jes s’pose he’d had a Mammy when dat temptin’ did begin,
An’ she’d a come an’ tole him,
“Son, don’ eat dat—dat’s a sin.”
But, Adam nevuh had no Mammy fuh to take him on her

On Falling,"Sometimes when night falls
it drifts gently to the ground silently
the way dandelions or bubbles do
a blanket over sleeping children
                Other times
It falls like fine china from shelves
weakened over years
or bricks dropped off of skyscrapers
            &
Sometimes when people fall
they fall like love
Into and out of
Head and heels
and such
            Other times
they fall like prey
or victim
to knees
from grace"
Courage Song for Scott Warren,"Sing: no more makeshift crosses
In the gangplank desert,
No more “dogcatcher trucks,”
No more jawbones under the moon—
Bring your rebellious grit, 
Like a bromide or a borderland candle,
To our bigotry-is-commonplace republic’s 
Chaos. Bold anima, dissenting angel, 
Among the betraying cliffs and dry washes, 
The yellow plumes of the palo verde,
Be runagate Harriet in a midnight cane field
(General Tubman!), be Martin bravely writing
In an abysmal Birmingham jail.
Yes, your boundless shepherd’s gallantry, 
Your on-tap compassion 
Is the rescuing sip 
& the heaven-sent gourd required
At all our desperate crossings.
 "
Clarinet,"At my family’s stained window,
A morning jay.
I stop my scissoring,
As if I could reclaim
A Santiago of bird-call
& sudden ease,
As if I could annul
The battle-gray maze of gutting
Jails, courthouses, morgues—
Purgatory where I bend
Over the burlap,
Again & again,
To show the blunt,
Still disillusioning world
The smashed black bell
Of your clarinet.
A blue swatch of your work-shirt becomes 
The irrevocable, raw dusk 
Of that day;
Here, in this farrago of scraps,
Your living room as I found it: 
Lunatic with ripped song sheets …
In imploring red,
A beggar’s scuffed vermilion,
I’ve stitched:
Whoever sees my arpillera,
Help me to pray for my son.
He was seen leaving rehearsal
At 7 o’clock.
He was seen in detention
At Londres #38.
He was seen; he was seen...
After so many years, perhaps     
You wouldn’t recognize me, Leonel;
I’ve become the weatherworn,
Undocile woman
Manacled to a tyrant’s fence,
A mother dancing the gueca solo
In the monitored plaza,
The ache of my make-do arms
Trumpeted,
Your rakish college photo
Pinned to my wind-riffled blouse:
In the arpillera,
A tiny, vivid, appliquéd doll,
Forever mourning,
Forever swaying
To your unforgettable woodwind.

The Only Way to Fight the Plague is Decency,"                                         (an American elegy)
  
Once upon a time there was a hoax,
A broadcast-to-the-hilt ruse, a puerile
Leader’s adamant refusal to rally arms
Against a colossal viral dragon,
A winter hustler’s fiat that bloomed,  
One titanic, coffin-heavy April,
Into a real-as-your-mama’s-dying-hand 
Pandemic: national melee, featuring
Stock-selling senators,
Missing-in-action test-kits,
Mask-begging nurses, millionaire high fives,
& jerrybuilt morgues,
A storm-haired Lear’s flaccid sideshow,  
A charlatan’s heedless, snake-oil matinee
(Hail the flimflamming functionary
& his red-handed band of rogues).
Land where all the poisonous hierarchies 
Arrived to poison us once more—
Where raucous pettiness equaled rollcalling, 
Brisk-as-business Death,
Equaled my crushed kingdom

Is Not (Don’t Interrupt the Sorrow),"        in memory of Eric Garner, 1970–2014

A Taser is not an answer
A rushing bullet is not a dream
There is no sunny god
In an Apollo Helmet
A livelong mercenary is not
A frisking meadow lamb
Lady Justice is no 
Fearsome chimera
No lurking drone
No business-as-usual Cerberus
A callous Caesar is not
A far-seeing Christ—
*
Listen: a blazing Mississippi cross 
Never presages a messiah.
A daffodil in a “sundown town” never signals
The onset of spring—
*
So after two callous seasons,
I finally dared to inquire
If his taken-too-soon father’s ousting
“Stand Your Ground” assassin
Was indeed white, “lily-white”
& naturally his response
In this volatile demesne,
This gallery of averted eyes
& gimcrack defenders galore
Was yes 
Dear God of course yes
*
Don’t interrupt the sorrow
A woman croons
But all I catch is the ack-ack-ack
Of ink-blotter redaction, 
The X-rated sputter of a black site’s 
Water-boarded man
Or a flailing cigarette seller,
Cuffed, gasping for air,
Jinxing arm & insignia
Marring his throat:

Is not
Is not
Is not
Is not—

"On September 14th, Dante’s Death Day","gone 700 years today
            leaving us here, in the
                      middle kingdom
                            Purgatory
which was Paradise once
                      but which we soiled
          and are about to
turn into hell, or
                      at least an Inferno
for homo sap sap, the
          disappearing species
                        — if it comes to that —
there’s life
          left, there will be
life left
        and right
it will move
                     on, even without us
it will rejoice in us
     gone — I can hear the
           birds celebrating
                       the trees too
                                 the air cooling
                                           the sea cooling
                       it will be the real paradise

ference!"
The Pool,"You mirage a dead world
in the white pool.
White rush and silver rush at twitterlight
meet and desire as the shy boy
lifts from his lover.
White rush and silver rush at twitterlight
touch in the wind and sleep.
Duck-green and willow-silver . . .
has no wing touched your cheek?
Is there no bird
to weave a nest between your sullen limbs
and hatch a songster,
(amber with lizard eyes)
to chirp above your phrases: “Love, love, love . . .”
Your world dies from the surface of the pool.
Why are your hands not on the willow leaves
to feel the sharpness and the thin, soft flower?
To feel . . .
love wrinkle at the touch like a soft bird?"
A Wading,"Many Black people that I know are afraid of the Ocean
not the textbook definition of feeling fear
but those who draw near
are only willing to wade
They are afraid 
to make waves
in a history that may sweep them away into the undercurrent of history repeating itself
because screaming help
didn’t assist our ancestors 
in fact the wading in the water
was a way to wash away a human’s scent
to leave dog’s noses no evidence 
of them being there
a passage way to freedom calling their names so quietly
only a soul could hear 
to draw near to that history is a stirring in our bones
an undertone 
that we put on a mute to silence what was never right
sometimes to win a fight
you get out of sight and yearn to be seen
beyond the horizon 
farther than the possible limit of sight
beyond what one was able to foresee
So in this time, there will be no repeat of history
We know where we came from
We know our destinations
No more plantations
We’re on a stay-cation
for a duration 
of our own imagination
We move in fascination
like the flow of water
We are the sons and daughters of our forefathers
Who left traces of themselves through blood, sweat, and tears
for years
of painful yesterdays
Imagine being enslaved during a slave trade and thought of a commodity 
Standing on docks
An auction block
of people of African descent 
Who didn’t know the possibility of an escape in those days
But were taught how to wade 
through labors leaving legacies 
Knowing how to Bob and Weave
Knitting together stories of unity 
A compass pointing in all directions of lifelines 
and Negro spirituals while peering through church windows
We are stained glass
with a colorful exterior 
of a painful past 
They called our neighbor “The Bottom”
8 miles from the Potomac River; where black people were free
Built our own homes and called it a community
Yet, many Black people that I know have a fear of the Ocean
But in their daily motions
They move through history like water flows
Absorbing, over, above, under, and around
a railroad and an underground
to freedom 
It’s not that we don’t know how to swim
We can propel our bodies through water
using the limbs
it’s that deep down we know our ancestors didn’t swim for pleasure in those days
it’s not that we are afraid
it’s that we’d rather move through our lives like the flow of water
and wade"
Per aspera ad astra,"We were lost in the plains,
beautiful and ordinary.
Sunflowers in the fields,
seeds of fallen stars,
standing tall; deeply 
rooted in this land.
I’ve admired how our flowers
shine, grasping towards the sky,
beyond the prairie grass, anchored
down to earth; mimicking the sun.
When a gardener plants the 
seeds of Helianthus, they are 
performing magic. Raising
stars out of the dust where
buzzing planets circle, half 
red moons set, and swarming 
comets float in orange comas.
I’ve always felt that late at night, 
in the bed of a truck, in a Kansas field, 
we were at the center of this universe.
And I was exactly where I should be,
amongst the flowers, not below."
Un Mango Grows in Kansas,"You have found me
hidden in a wheat field
within a husk of corn
growing for you
I am ready
pick me
Hold me in your hands
remove my skin
peel away my color
find that I am tender
soft and sweet
Eat of me
until there is nothing
and your mouths are empty
and your bellies filled
What is left
will live
as seed 
to grow 
again
brighter 
hardened
and less bitter"

In The Red,"you’ve worked so hard
from the farm to the factory
in the county & the city

—your body as collateral
so you may rest & retire
when the time came
—knowing you’ll be fine
but somehow
you still owe today
& you are all out of body "
Mi Isla,"I ate a mango today
it was mostly green
with reds and yellows.
El Yunque, at dawn
is mostly green
with reds and yellows.
My homeland’s enchanted
full of shady jungle mountains,
gawking naked beaches;
slowly necking ocean.
There, 
sea breezes woo the palm trees
and peeping coconuts faint
from holding on too long,
in sand, asleep;
daydreaming of me.
Tonight, 
un brindis por ti Papá.
Let us pretend, the crickets are
drunken coquies de parranda,
struggling with loss,
singing in the wrong key,
playing out of tune; unable
to find their way home.
Let us pretend, we are surrounded
by vacation not work,
that all this wheat is beach,
that the above blue is ocean.
Let us pretend, you are watching me, 
ripe in a hammock’s womb,
strung to horizons with no ocean
or beach sand near nor fear 
that I’ve become landlocked here,
surrounded by jíbaros,
who don’t like jíbaros;
still an island."
Haiku,"I shovel snow
from Cleveland front lawn
just to see green
crow’s breath
after caw hangs,
winter air
snow furrow cornfield,
old woman peering
in roadside mailbox
office windowsill
fly poised for flight
three months now
sakura petals fallen
she gathers them in small hands
spills them on soft breeze
Kerouac, we knock
your pickled bones together,
zen be-bop
America, more guns
than people, more bullets
than tears
it took 800 years
for Roman Empire’s fall —
they had no internet
first man to walk
on the moon has died,
his footprint still up there
cleaning my office
I find a faded article,
“cleaning your office”
between bright stars
and atoms inside I spin,
breath burning away"
Youth,"The dew is on the grasses, dear,
    The blush is on the rose,
And swift across our dial-youth,
    A shifting shadow goes.
The primrose moments, lush with bliss.
    Exhale and fade away,
Life may renew the Autumn time,
    But nevermore the May!"
Winter Solstice,"Late December grinds on down.
The sky stops, slate on slate,
scatters a cold light of snow
across a field of brittle weeds.
Each boot step cracks a stalk.
The pigments have been dragged
earthwards and clasped. The groundhog
curls among the roots curling.
Towards home I peel blossoms
of frozen mud from my pant legs
and pull off burrs that waited
for wind or the flashing red fox.
In my jacket pocket I find
a beechnut, slightly cracked
open, somehow fallen there,
and, enfolded inside of it,
a spider that unclenches
yellow in my steaming palm –
a spider that is 
the sun."
Welt,"Would I might mend the fabric of my youth
That daily flaunts its tatters to my eyes,
Would I might compromise awhile with truth
Until our moon now waxing, wanes and dies.
For I would go a further while with you,
And drain this cup so tantalant and fair
Which meets my parched lips like cooling dew,
Ere time has brushed cold fingers through my hair!"
My Little Dreams,"I’m folding up my little dreams
Within my heart tonight,
And praying I may soon forget
The torture of their sight.
For Time’s deft fingers scroll my brow
With fell relentless art—
I’m folding up my little dreams
Tonight, within my heart!"
Grandfather’s Breath,"You work. You work, Buddy. You work.
Word of immigrant get-ahead grind I hear
huffing through me, my grandfather’s breath,
when he’d come in from Saturday’s keep-busy chores,
fending up a calloused hand to stop
me from helping him, haggard cheeks puffing
out like grey t-shirts hung between tenements,
doubled-over under thirty-five years a machine
repairman at the ball-bearing factory, ball-bearings
making everything run smoother—
especially torpedoes. He busted butt
for the war effort, for profiteers, for overtime pay
down-payment on a little box of his own,
himself a refugee from the European economy,
washed ashore after The War to End All Wars.
Cheap labor for the winners.
I hear his youth plodding through the hayfields
above Srednevas, and the train that wheezed
and lumbered to the Trieste, the boat where he heave-hoed
consumptive sister, one-two-overboard.
I hear him scuffling along factory smoke choked streets
of Cleveland, coughing out chunks of broken
English just to make it to Saturday morning balinca—
how he grunted off a week’s worth of grit
hurling wooden balls down the pressed dirt court,
sweaty wisp of gray hair wagging from his forehead,
This is how the world turns. You work hard. You practice.
And I hear his claim as we climbed the steps
of Municipal Stadium, higher, into the cheap seats,
slapping the flat of his hand against a girder,
I built this, Buddy. I built this.
But mostly I hear how he’d catch
what was left of his breath after those Saturday chores,
pouring out that one, long, tall cold beer
that Grandma allowed, holding it aloft,
bubbles golden as hayfields above Srednavas,
before savoring it down and taking up
the last task of his day off—cleaning the cage,
letting Snowball, canary like the ones once used
to test coal mines for poison air, flap clumsily free
around the living room, crapping
on the plastic covered davenport and easy-chair
they only sat in twice a year.
And I’m still breathing, Grandfather, that day
you took me down the basement to the cool floor
to find out what was wrong. Come on, Snowball,
fly. Fly! The bird splayed out on the same linoleum
where they found you, next to your iron lung,
where Grandma mopped for weeks after,
pointing with arthritic fingers, See. There.
There’s where he fell and bumped his head.
See the specks of blood? She can’t work out.
One fine morning when my work is done
I’m gonna fly away home, fly away home.
Come on, Snowball, fly. Fly!"
And What Shall You Say?,"Brother, come!
And let us go unto our God.
And when we stand before Him
I shall say—
“Lord, I do not hate,
I am hated.
I scourge no one,
I am scourged.
I covet no lands,
My lands are coveted.
I mock no peoples,
My people are mocked.”
And, brother, what shall you say?"
Is it Because I am Black,"Why do men smile when I speak,
And call my speech
The whimperings of a babe
That cries but knows not what it wants?
Is it because I am black?
Why do men sneer when I arise
And stand in their councils,
And look them eye to eye,
And speak their tongue?
Is it because I am black?"
The Band of Gideon,"The band of Gideon roam the sky,
The howling wind is their war-cry,
The thunder’s roll is their trump’s peal,
And the lightning’s flash their vengeful steel.
        Each black cloud
        Is a fiery steed.
        And they cry aloud
        With each strong deed,
“The sword of the Lord and Gideon.”
And men below rear temples high
And mock their God with reasons why,
And live in arrogance, sin and shame,
And rape their souls for the world’s good name.
        Each black cloud
        Is a fiery steed.
        And they cry aloud
        With each strong deed,
“The sword of the Lord and Gideon.”
The band of Gideon roam the sky
And view the earth with baleful eye;
In holy wrath they scourge the land
With earthquake, storm and burning brand.
        Each black cloud
        Is a fiery steed.
        And they cry aloud
        With each strong deed,
“The sword of the Lord and Gideon.”
The lightnings flash and the thunders roll,
And “Lord have mercy on my soul,”
Cry men as they fall on the stricken sod,
In agony searching for their God.
        Each black cloud
        Is a fiery steed.
        And they cry aloud
        With each strong deed,
“The sword of the Lord and Gideon.”
And men repent and then forget
That heavenly wrath they ever met,
The band of Gideon yet will come
And strike their tongues of blasphemy dumb.
        Each black cloud
        Is a fiery steed.
        And they cry aloud
        With each strong deed,
“The sword of the Lord and Gideon.”"

Zalka Peetruza,"(Who Was Christened Lucy Jane)
She danced, near nude, to tom-tom beat,
With swaying arms and flying feet,
’Mid swirling spangles, gauze and lace,
Her all was dancing—save her face.
A conscience, dumb to brooding fears,
Companioned hearing deaf to cheers;
A body, marshaled by the will,
Kept dancing while a heart stood still:
And eyes obsessed with vacant stare,
Looked over heads to empty air,
As though they sought to find therein
Redemption for a maiden sin.
’Twas thus, amid force driven grace,
We found the lost look on her face;
And then, to us, did it occur
That, though we saw—we saw not her."

Negro Poets,"Full many lift and sing
Their sweet imagining;
Not yet the Lyric Seer,
The one bard of the throng,
With highest gift of song,
Breaks on our sentient ear.
Not yet the gifted child,
With notes enraptured, wild,
That storm and throng the heart,
To make his rage our own,
Our hearts his lyric throne;
Hard won by cosmic art.
I hear the sad refrain,
Of slavery’s sorrow-strain;
The broken half-lispt speech
Of freedom’s twilit hour;
The greater growing reach
Of larger latent power.
Here and there a growing note
Swells from a conscious throat;
Thrilled with a message fraught
The pregnant hour is near;
We wait our Lyric Seer;
By whom our wills are caught.
Who makes our cause and wrong
The motif of his song;
Who sings our racial good,
Bestows us honor’s place,
The cosmic brotherhood
Of genius—not of race.
Blind Homer, Greek or Jew,
Of fame’s immortal few
Would still be deathless born;
Frail Dunbar, black or white.
In Fame’s eternal light,
Would shine a Star of Morn.
An unhorizoned range,
Our hour of doubt and change,
Gives song a nightless day,
Whose pen with pregnant mirth
Will give our longings birth,
And point our souls the way?"
The Washer-Woman,"A great swart cheek and the gleam of tears,
The flutter of hopes and the shadow of fears,
And all day long the rub and scrub
With only a breath betwixt tub and tub.
Fool! Thou hast toiled for fifty years
And what hast thou now but thy dusty tears?
In silence she rubbed . . . But her face I had seen,
Where the light of her soul fell shining and clean."
Christmas Eve in France,"Oh, little Christ, why do you sigh
    As you look down tonight
On breathless France, on bleeding France,
    And all her dreadful plight?
What bows your childish head so low?
    What turns your cheek so white?
Oh, little Christ, why do you moan,
    What is it that you see
In mourning France, in martyred France,
    And her great agony?
Does she recall your own dark day,
    Your own Gethsemane?
Oh, little Christ, why do you weep,
    Why flow your tears so sore
For pleading France, for praying France,
    A suppliant at God’s door?
“God sweetened not my cup,” you say,
    “Shall He for France do more?”
Oh, little Christ, what can this mean,
    Why must this horror be
For fainting France, for faithful France,
    And her sweet chivalry?
“I bled to free all men,” you say
    “France bleeds to keep men free.”
Oh, little, lovely Christ—you smile!
    What guerdon is in store
For gallant France, for glorious France,
    And all her valiant corps?
“Behold I live, and France, like me,
    Shall live for evermore.”"

Timid Lover,"I who employ a poet’s tongue,
Would tell you how
You are a golden damson hung
Upon a silver bough.
I who adore exotic things
Would shape a sound
To be your name, a word that sings
Until the head goes round.
I who am proud with other folk
Would grow complete
In pride on bitter words you spoke,
And kiss your petaled feet.
But never past the frail intent
My will may flow,
Though gentle looks of yours are bent
Upon me where I go.
So must I, starved for love’s delight,
Affect the mute,
When love’s divinest acolyte
Extends me holy fruit."
Uncle Jim,"“White folks is white,” says Uncle Jim;
“A platitude,” I sneer;
And then I tell him so is milk,
And the froth upon his beer.
His heart walled up with bitterness,
He smokes his pungent pipe,
And nods at me as if to say,
“Young fool, you’ll soon be ripe!”
I have a friend who eats his heart
Away with grief of mine,
Who drinks my joy as tipplers drain
Deep goblets filled with wine.
I wonder why here at his side,
Face-in-the-grass with him,
My mind should stray the Grecian urn
To muse on Uncle Jim."

Song of My Muhammad,"after Walt Whitman1
I know I have the best of time and space in my two black fists
                in my black brain, the way I can never, will never be measured,
                this, my immeasurable greatness,
                this, my beauty and my speed
                           I do not need
                               your white Jesus or even your feeble praise—
                               I know I’m the prettiest thing that ever lived.
No friend of mine tells me who I can worship,
no friend of mine stops my dance around the ring,
no friend of mine labels my chair anything but throne,
I have no chair, no church, no philosophy that does not salute me as a king,
                no man can stop my left hand hooking, hooking, 
                no man can stop the poetry I keep under my Louisville lip,
                I’m so mean I make medicine sick. 
Today, I shoulder my way into a crowded heaven,
where my hands are steady and my mind is strong,
                    and I say to my spirit: 
                    you are golden, even here, golden,
                    and my spirit says: I am satisfied. 
1using lines from Walt Whitman’s Song of Myself, verse 46, and Ali’s own words"
Harriette Winslow and Aunt Rachel Clean Collard Greens on Prime Time Television,"In their dollhouse kitchen, 
they clean a bouquet
of collards
while the comedy of errors
unfolds around them—
Harriette in her pantsuit and that blackmother
smirk that signals the hard love only a mother
can muster. This, holy kitchen,
culinary sanctuary, covers them
in light, its white glory a bouquet
around their perfect hair. Their fingers know no errors
as they pick and place the collards.
There was an earthy magic in my mother cleaning collards,
their mineral scent, the sink-full of water my mother
plunged them into, the water which washed them of their errors—
greens baptized, clean from sediment and rock, our kitchen
sink her pulpit, the leafy bouquet
her holy book. How we wished we could be them,
touched by our mother’s godly hands, then
cleaned so well we forgot they were just collards—
they glistened, a sparkling bouquet
of dinner-yet-to-come, so loved by our mother
that even they forgot their natural bitterness. A kitchen
is sweetened when collards are cooking, the air a  
swelling porkfat perfume, the onion’s pungent terror
nulled by the ribboned greens—I loved to watch my mother cut them,
roll the piles of flat foliage up like a cigar, the kitchen
knife shining against a tight army of collards. 
We needed no superheroes when we had her, a mother
to rival every black mom on cable—no fragrant bouquet
could rival the smell of her greens and cornbread, the bouquet
of cotton swabs and peroxide she’d use to sanitize our playground errors.
She was a magician, more than just another mother—
she could turn an afro into a constellation of braids, adorn them
with a galaxy of beads. She could turn a sprawling batch of collards 
into a smooth and savory feast, a world exploding in her small kitchen.
Someday, mother, I will inherit that sweet bouquet  
of cocoa butter, Blue Magic, kitchen smoke and calm night air, 
the perfume of black motherhood. One day, I will learn how to cook them collards."
Photosynthesis,"When I was young, my father taught us
how dirt made way for food,
how to turn over soil so it would hold a seed,
an infant bud, how the dark could nurse it
until it broke its green arms out to touch the sun.
In every backyard we’ve ever had, he made a little garden plot
with room for heirloom tomatoes, corn, carrots, 
peppers: jalapeno, bell, and poblano—
okra, eggplant, lemons, collards, broccoli, pole beans,
watermelon, squash, trees filled with fruit and nuts,
brussels sprouts, herbs: basil, mint, parsley, rosemary—
onions, sweet potatoes, cucumber, cantaloupe, cabbage, 
oranges, swiss chard and peaches,
sunflowers tall and straightbacked as soldiers,
lantana, amaryllis, echinacea, 
pansies and roses and bushes bubbling with hydrangeas. 
Every plant with its purpose.
Flowers to bring worms and wasps. How their work matters here. 
This is the work we have always known,
pulling food and flowers from a pile of earth.
The difference, now: my father is not a slave,
not a sharecropper. This land is his and so is this garden,
so is this work. The difference is that he owns this labor.
The work of his own hands for his own belly, 
for his own children’s bellies. We eat because he works. 
This is the legacy of his grandmother, my great-granny.
Ollie Mae Harris and her untouchable flower garden.
Just like her hats, her flowerbeds sprouted something special,
plants and colors the neighbors could only dream of.
He was young when he learned that this beauty is built on work,
the cows and the factories in their stomachs, 
the fertilizer they spewed out—
the stink that brought such fragrance. What you call waste,
I call power. What you call work I make beautiful again.
In his garden, even problems become energy, beauty—
my father has ended many work days in the backyard, 
worries of the firehouse dropping like grain, my father wrist-deep
in soil. I am convinced the earth speaks back to him 
as he feeds it—it is a conversational labor, gardening.
The seeds tell him what they will be, the soil tells seeds how to grow,
my father speaks sun and water into the earth,
we hear him, each harvest, his heartbeat sweet, like fruit. "
Love Note: Surely,"with first line from Gwendolyn Brooks
Surely you stay my certain own, you stay
obtuse. Surely your kisses were little poisons 
gripping tight my lips, my arms, mapping their way
across my unsure body. Surely, this fission
is a gift—a gilded parcel laced like God, scent 
of Mother Mary’s milkbreath and her virgin promise,
that virginal mirror, me. Surely, I was sent—
and, incidentally, that other she, to put you on notice—
hearts aren’t toys for juggling, no, the blood
too sticky to really ever disappear—
surely you know that. Surely, your own beating brick withstood
the blows I tried to strike with my unrelenting care.
The morning opens, now, without your sun-blacked face—
the bluejays and morningbirds sing away your waste."
Summer Vacation in the Subjunctive,"If I were a woman. If I were a wanted woman. If I were a woman with soft fingers. If I were on a beach with a man—if he was a man, if a man can be a man before he acts like a man. If I were on a beach with a man and he held my hand. If I liked my hand being held, even if it was held at the wrong angle. If my wrist was wringing in pain but I kept it there. If my heart were held wrong, like my hand. If I kept it there. If I was kept. If I was kept in pain. If I were pain. If I were a woman—if I were a woman before I was a woman. If I were a woman who knew her body like a woman knows her body. If a woman knew. If I knew. If I were on a beach with that man—if, this time, that man dissolved into sand. If the sand became hot under my feet but my feet were gold. If a woman were made of sun. If I were made of sun. If I burned the world around me until it shone beautiful and brown. If this burning was called healing. If the healing made light."
I Find the Earring that Broke Loose from My Ear the Night a White Woman Told Me the World Would Save Her,"I remember:
that earring made me feel so free, so full of beauty—the kind that you might notice. Beauty that could make my shoulders glow. I remember her face, alight with a devious curiosity in the porchlight of the house party—that party in that city which slathered a film over its racism with clean streets and yard signs proclaiming inclusion. That city in that American state which legally excluded Black residents in 1844, which entered the union, big, proud, and white. Does it matter that this woman was not evil, did not send bombs to kill children in a far-off country, did not buy or sell a single slave? Picking up the earring, unwearable until I find another hook on which to hang it from my ear, I remember, again, the words and their cool sting. I’m a white woman, people protect us. Does it matter what I said to invite these words? Does it matter that I did not invite these words? Does it matter that she thought this was a joke, a sign that she was on the “right side,” a way to pass a moment under the porchlight? I’ve been thinking about intention lately, how I'm always asked to consider how good a person is, what they meant versus what they said. I think about the man who called me colored at a hotel in 2019. I think about the n-word out of a white person’s mouth. About erasure. I wonder about the road to hell, which, they say, is paved in these same intentions—good. George Zimmerman intended to protect his sidewalk from Trayvon’s body, invasively alive. George Washington intended to protect America from Britain’s oppression—nevermind those oppressed Black bodies. Yes, I am weaving a rope between George Zimmerman and George Washington. Yes, I am saying it. My country tis of thee, sweet land of white supremacy. When she said it, my face could barely twist into anything but fatigue. I am tired over and over again of being told I am not human enough to matter. The white poet rages against me on Facebook. Maybe he imagines my blood against his ivory tower. Maybe he imagines the many bricks my foremothers and fathers built—LucillePhyllisGwendolynPaulLawrenceLangstonSoniaMayaNikki—tumbling at the flick of his well-educated thumb.  Is even my degree a different color, relegated to the back of a bus, a book? The business of poetry so thick with privilege, so smothered in the rust of its old gates—how can you breathe among all that rot? On the news, the man they call president tells us to go back from where we came. I think of all the lost ones thrown over boats, the ones locked away in cages, the ones here, sitting as American as the day is long and still called wrong. The earring says I once was lost when I find it, tells me it can be repaired. It is an earring of the struggle. It wants that ear it once called home, it wants to touch my brown skin and reflect it in its orbiting gold. I look for my pliers, my jewelry kit. The work is always the thing that makes us whole again."

The Store Poem,"I’m past the point of no return
Then I remember—my promise
In making me a customer to my service
That came with non-Negotiable terms
Targeted as a Non-Walmart policy
That I won’t nor can’t return myself
When I left the shelf
I started life
These priceless times are tagged on me
to remind myself
that I have to retail
Re-tail
Re-tell myself not to discount me
I am the manager
On call and general
The answer to how can I help you
Is always found on the
row with the mirrors
What’s new in store
Has always been In store
The inventory has been
Barcoded and account for
My worth is my offer
And that’s my only offer

This Side Up,"A few things I’ve learned from Henry Brown.
First, he was a Virginia slave—
Henry Brown arrived in Philadelphia March 30, 1849 as
a free man
Second, he got a nick name—
Henry Box Brown shipped himself in a wooden crate
that was 3 feet long by 2 feet wide and displayed the
words “dry goods” and “this side up”
Third, this side up is the best example of foreshadowing
I’ve ever learned about
Fourth, when Box Brown rose out of his crate that he
had just spent 30 hours
inside of...
he called
that moment
a resurrection.
So I ask—
Let your truth seep
What is within you that should rise
If you feel froggy – you leap
When was the last time
You truly felt Phoenix—
Because I can see—
That you’re fire—you’re fly
(At the same dang time)
I wonder
What are the limitations of your hunger
The trench of your thirst
Not for water—not for food
But for your future
I have a query of questions
For your internal tribe
Five!
Marching has become partial payment
The stakes of Freedom take a Kobe investment
Sometimes we’re fork and knife ready with no
plates – no mats – no table
Six:
Our people find moments of perseverance
When we’re being gambled
In between
Distraction and Destiny
Destruction and Divinity
Seventh thing I’ve learned:
Perfection is overrated
And it’s not worth more than the
Complete path.
Eight:
Other than skin color
Henry Box Brown mirrors Dr. King
Sometimes you’re too busy thinking outside the
box when God is telling you
to go in
Dream packages are shipped with His stamp of
approval
So square up dreamers
We’re already inside the ring
And it’s up to us to
Be boxed in
Or be ready to Box
Because as you know
As foreshadow-boxing goes
It’s always This Side Up"
Yet Do I Marvel,"I doubt not God is good, well-meaning, kind,
And did He stoop to quibble could tell why
The little buried mole continues blind,
Why flesh that mirrors Him must some day die,
Make plain the reason tortured Tantalus
Is baited by the fickle fruit, declare
If merely brute caprice dooms Sisyphus
To struggle up a never-ending stair.
Inscrutable His ways are, and immune
To catechism by a mind too strewn
With petty cares to slightly understand
What awful brain compels His awful hand.
Yet do I marvel at this curious thing:
To make a poet black, and bid him sing!"
Hard Daddy,"I went to ma daddy,
Says Daddy I have got de blues.
Went to ma daddy,
Says Daddy I have got de blues.
Ma daddy says. Honey,
Can’t you bring no better news?
I cried on his shoulder but
He turned his back on me.
Cried on his shoulder but
He turned his back on me.
He said a woman’s cryin’s
Never gonna bother me.
I wish I had wings to
Fly like de eagle flies.
Wish I had wings to
Fly like de eagle flies.
I’d fly on ma man an’
I’d scratch out both his eyes."
Fantasy in Purple,"Beat the drums of tragedy for me.
Beat the drums of tragedy and death.
And let the choir sing a stormy song
To drown the rattle of my dying breath.
Beat the drums of tragedy for me,
And let the white violins whir thin and slow,
But blow one blaring trumpet note of sun
To go with me
                       to the darkness
                                                where I go."

A Song of Thanks,"For the sun that shone at the dawn of spring,
For the flowers which bloom and the birds that sing,
For the verdant robe of the gray old earth,
For her coffers filled with their countless worth,
For the flocks which feed on a thousand hills,
For the rippling streams which turn the mills,
For the lowing herds in the lovely vale,
For the songs of gladness on the gale,—
From the Gulf and the Lakes to the Oceans’ banks,—
Lord God of Hosts, we give Thee thanks!
For the farmer reaping his whitened fields,
For the bounty which the rich soil yields,
For the cooling dews and refreshing rains,
For the sun which ripens the golden grains,
For the bearded wheat and the fattened swine,
For the stalléd ox and the fruitful vine,
For the tubers large and cotton white,
For the kid and the lambkin frisk and blithe,
For the swan which floats near the river-banks,—
Lord God of Hosts, we give Thee thanks!
For the pumpkin sweet and the yellow yam,
For the corn and beans and the sugared ham,
For the plum and the peach and the apple red,
For the dear old press where the wine is tread,
For the cock which crows at the breaking dawn,
And the proud old “turk” at the farmer’s barn,
For the fish which swim in the babbling brooks,
For the game which hide in the shady nooks,—
From the Gulf and the Lakes to the Oceans’ banks —
Lord God of Hosts, we give Thee thanks!
For the sturdy oaks and the stately pines,
For the lead and the coal from the deep, dark mines,
For the silver ores of a thousand fold,
For the diamond bright and the yellow gold,
For the river boat and the flying train,
For the fleecy sail of the rolling main,
For the velvet sponge and the glossy pearl,
For the flag of peace which we now unfurl—
From the Gulf and the Lakes to the Oceans’ banks—
Lord God of Hosts, we give Thee thanks!
For the lowly cot and the mansion fair,
For the peace and plenty together share,
For the Hand which guides us from above,
For Thy tender mercies, abiding love,
For the blessed home with its children gay,
For returnings of Thanksgiving Day,
For the bearing toils and the sharing cares,
We lift up our hearts in our songs and our prayers—
From the Gulf and the Lakes to the Oceans’ banks—
Lord God of Hosts, we give Thee thanks!"
Strong Men,"They dragged you from homeland,
They chained you in coffles,
They huddled you spoon-fashion in filthy hatches,
They sold you to give a few gentlemen ease.
They broke you in like oxen,
They scourged you,
They branded you,
They made your women breeders,
They swelled your numbers with bastards. . . .
They taught you the religion they disgraced.
You sang:
            Keep a inchin’ along
            Lak a po’ inch worm. . . .
You sang:

                The strong men git stronger.
They point with pride to the roads you built for them,
They ride in comfort over the rails you laid for them.
They put hammers in your hands
And said—Drive so much before sundown.
You sang:
             Ain’t no hammah
             In dis lan’,
             Strikes lak mine, bebby,
             Strikes lak mine.
They cooped you in their kitchens,
They penned you in their factories,
They gave you the jobs that they were too good for,
They tried to guarantee happiness to themselves
By shunting dirt and misery to you.
You sang:
             Me an’ muh baby gonna shine, shine
             Me an’ muh baby gonna shine.
                     The strong men keep a-comin’ on
                     The strong men git stronger . . .
They bought off some of your leaders
You stumbled, as blind men will . . .
They coaxed you, unwontedly soft voiced . . .
You followed a way.
Then laughed as usual.
They heard the laugh and wondered;
Uncomfortable;
Unadmitting a deeper terror. . . .
                    The strong men keep a-comin’ on
                    Gittin’ stronger. . . .
What, from the slums
Where they have hemmed you,
What, from the tiny huts
They could not keep from you—
What reaches them
Making them ill at ease, fearful?
Today they shout prohibition at you
“Thou shalt not this”
“Thou shalt not that”
“Reserved for whites only”
You laugh.
One thing they cannot prohibit—
                     The strong men . . . coming on
                     The strong men gittin’ stronger.
                     Strong men . . .
                     Stronger . . ."
Effie,"She who was easy for any chance lover,
Whose frequent laugh rang flaccid and shrill;
She, finding death at last, the dazed fret over,
Lies here so oddly stern for once, and still.
Put her away, and put away with her
What she has now of harshness and strength,
She who was clay for any clumsy sculptor
Becomes inflexible; fixed of form at length.
She who would veer with any passing wind
Like a rusty vane with rickety ways,
She is aloof now, and seems—oh, so determined;
And that is the Paradise crowning her days."
A Black Man Talks of Reaping,"I have sown beside all waters in my day.
I planted deep within my heart the fear
That wind or fowl would take the grain away.
I planted safe against this stark, lean year.
I scattered seed enough to plant the land
In rows from Canada to Mexico.
But for my reaping only what the hand
Can hold at once is all that I can show.
Yet what I sowed and what the orchard yields
My brother’s sons are gathering stalk and root,
Small wonder then my children glean in fields
They have not sown, and feed on bitter fruit."
Blight,"I have seen a lovely thing
Stark before a whip of weather:
The tree that was so wistful after spring
Beating barren twigs together.
The birds that came there one by one.
The sensuous leaves that used to sway
And whisper there at night, all are gone,
Each has vanished in its way.

And this whip is on my heart;
There is no sound that it allows,
No little song that I may start
But I hear the beating of dead boughs."
Nocturne at Bethesda,"I thought I saw an angel flying low,
I thought I saw the flicker of a wing
Above the mulberry trees; but not again.
Bethesda sleeps. This ancient pool that healed
A host of bearded Jews does not awake.
This pool that once the angels troubled does not move.
No angel stirs it now, no Saviour comes
With healing in His hands to raise the sick
And bid the lame man leap upon the ground.
The golden days are gone. Why do we wait
So long upon the marble steps, blood
Falling from our open wounds? and why
Do our black faces search the empty sky?
Is there something we have forgotten? some precious thing
We have lost, wandering in strange lands?
There was a day, I remember now,
I beat my breast and cried, “Wash me, God,
Wash me with a wave of wind upon
The barley; O quiet One, draw near, draw near!
Walk upon the hills with lovely feet
And in the waterfall stand and speak.
“Dip white hands in the lily pool and mourn
Upon the harps still hanging in the trees
Near Babylon along the river’s edge,
But oh, remember me, I pray, before
The summer goes and rose leaves lose their red.”
The old terror takes my heart, the fear
Of quiet waters and of faint twilights.
There will be better days when I am gone
And healing pools where I cannot be healed.
Fragrant stars will gleam forever and ever
Above the place where I lie desolate.
Yet I hope, still I long to live.
And if there can be returning after death
I shall come back. But it will not be here;
If you want me you must search for me
Beneath the palms of Africa. Or if
I am not there then you may call to me
Across the shining dunes, perhaps I shall
Be following a desert caravan.
I may pass through centuries of death
With quiet eyes, but I’ll remember still
A jungle tree with burning scarlet birds.
There is something I have forgotten, some precious thing.
I shall be seeking ornaments of ivory,
I shall be dying for a jungle fruit.
                        You do not hear, Bethesda.
O still green water in a stagnant pool!
Love abandoned you and me alike.
There was a day you held a rich full moon
Upon your heart and listened to the words
Of men now dead and saw the angels fly.
There is a simple story on your face;
Years have wrinkled you. I know, Bethesda!
You are sad. It is the same with me."
God Give to Men,"God give the yellow man
An easy breeze at blossom time.
Grant his eager, slanting eyes to cover
Every land and dream
Of afterwhile.
Give blue-eyed men their swivel chairs
To whirl in tall buildings.
Allow them many ships at sea,
And on land, soldiers
And policemen.
For black man, God,
No need to bother more
But only fill afresh his meed
Of laughter,
His cup of tears.
God suffer little men
The taste of soul’s desire."
Poem,"Little brown boy,
Slim, dark, big-eyed,
Crooning love songs to your banjo
Down at the Lafayette—
Gee, boy, I love the way you hold your head,
High sort of and a bit to one side,
Like a prince, a jazz prince. And I love
Your eyes flashing, and your hands,
And your patent-leathered feet,
And your shoulders jerking the jig-wa.
And I love your teeth flashing,
And the way your hair shines in the spotlight
Like it was the real stuff.
Gee, brown boy, I loves you all over.
I’m glad I’m a jig. I’m glad I can
Understand your dancin’ and your
Singin’, and feel all the happiness
And joy and don’t-care in you.
Gee, boy, when you sing, I can close my ears
And hear tomtoms just as plain.
Listen to me, will you, what do I know
About tomtoms? But I like the word, sort of,
Don’t you? It belongs to us.
Gee, boy, I love the way you hold your head,
And the way you sing and dance,
And everything.
Say, I think you’re wonderful. You’re
All right with me,
You are."
The Road,"Ah, little road, all whirry in the breeze,
A leaping clay hill lost among the trees,
The bleeding note of rapture streaming thrush
Caught in a drowsy bush
And stretched out in a single singing line of dusky song.
Ah, little road, brown as my race is brown,
Your trodden beauty like our trodden pride,
Dust of the dust, they must not bruise you down.
Rise to one brimming golden, spilling cry!"
A Decade,"When you came, you were like red wine and honey,
And the taste of you burnt my mouth with its sweetness.
Now you are like morning bread,
Smooth and pleasant.
I hardly taste you at all for I know your savour,
But I am completely nourished."
Sonnet to a Negro in Harlem,"You are disdainful and magnificent—
Your perfect body and your pompous gait,
Your dark eyes flashing solemnly with hate,
Small wonder that you are incompetent
To imitate those whom you so despise—
Your shoulders towering high above the throng,
Your head thrown back in rich, barbaric song,
Palm trees and mangoes stretched before your eyes.
Let others toil and sweat for labor’s sake
And wring from grasping hands their meed of gold.
Why urge ahead your supercilious feet?
Scorn will efface each footprint that you make.
I love your laughter arrogant and bold.
You are too splendid for this city street."
Remember Not,"Remember not the promises we made
In this same garden many moons ago.
You must forget them. I would have it so.
Old vows are like old flowers as they fade
And vaguely vanish in a feeble death.
There is no reason why your hands should clutch
At pretty yesterdays. There is not much
Of beauty in me now. And though my breath
Is quick, my body sentient, my heart
Attuned to romance as before, you must
Not, through mistaken chivalry, pretend
To love me still. There is no mortal art
Can overcome Time’s deep, corroding rust.
Let Love’s beginning expiate Love’s end."
Threnody,"Only quiet death
Brings relief
From the wearisome
Interchange
Of hope and grief.
O body
(Credulous heart
And dream-torn head),
What will wisdom be
Or folly—
When you lie dead?
Life-beaten body
Bruised and sore—
Neither hunger nor satiety
Are known beyond death’s door."
Conception,"Jesus’ mother never had no man.
God came to her one day an’ said,
“Mary, chile, kiss ma han’.”"
Troubled Jesus,"Ma Jesus
Was a troubled man,
Wid lots o’ sorrow
In His breast.
Oh, he was weary
When they laid Him
In the tomb to rest.
Po’, good Jesus."
Crucifixion,"They howled ’til Pilate
Sent dear Jesus out.
Then they cursed Him
An’ knocked Him all about.
O brothers, O sisters,
Think what those sinners done—
Crucified the Lord’s Son!
Think, think . . . Oh, think . . ."
Wake Cry,"He was a good man.
All men have to die.
O Death,
Did you ever
Fall on your knees
In tears an’ cry?
He was a good man,
Hear the widow moan.
O Death,
Do you weep—
Or is your heart
Made o’ stone?"
Burial of the Young Love,"Weep not,
You who love her.
Place your flowers
Above her
And go your way
Only I shall stay.
After you have gone
With grief in your hearts,
I will remove the flowers
You laid above her.
Yes, I who love her.
Do not weep,
Friends and lovers.
(Oh, the scent of flowers in the air!
Oh, the beauty of her body there!)
Gently now lay your flowers down.
When the last mourner has gone
And I have torn
Each flower;
When the last mourner has gone
And I have tossed
Broken stems and flower heads
To the winds . . . ah! . . .
I will gather withered leaves . . .
I will scatter withered leaves there.
Friends and lovers,
Do not weep.
Gently lay your flowers down . . .
Gently, now, lay your flowers down."
Finis,"Now that our love has drifted
To a quiet close,
Leaving the empty ache
That always follows when beauty goes;
Now that you and I,
Who stood tip-toe on earth
To touch our fingers to the sky,
Have turned away
To allow our little love to die—
Go, dear, seek again the magic touch.
But if you are wise,
As I shall be wise,
You will not again
Love over much."
from “The Rose”,"I heard myself in every cell the singer sang
The wind in the singer had to pass through her heart
When the queen ascended into view I was with her, hiding
In her darkness. When she fell from favor
I fell too. I governed
Myself with silence. I covered my wound
In my own naked body
I said no protest words when the stranger 
Entered me. I’ll forget his face, I told myself
I closed my eyes and I did not forget it
Though it was many a good thing in spite of this
I did manage to forget: healing
Potions, songs, and secret sounds
The rose with its mouth like a child’s, asleep
Minaret, thorn, spire, steeple
Wishful flavor, exhausted people
Two cups of blood, one grain of sand
Receding flesh with your tooth in its hand
If I knew the words I would bid the mother of us all be seated
As it is I pull out a chair for my own mother to sit in
I offer her a cigarette
I light it for her in my mouth"
Love Poem with Bighead,"the dignity I’ve actually earned could fit 
in a pigeon’s eye, holy and not merely so, 
jupiter holy, gravity-making holy 
jerking me around like a horse dragging
his cowboy through the mud, no ghoulish cruelty though,
no genius, just our cat leering out the window 
like a French marquise, sprinkling drugs into our 
drugs like it’s 2009, Jehovah, the aridness 
of prayer, the aridness of public hygiene, holy too 
that babies recognize logos at six months, generous 
to be given detectable villains, birdgrass 
growing up to the pink striped fruit you’ll leave 
for the squirrels, ya Ali, the part of you that weeps
at dead fish in the market, how to extract that, 
inject it straight into my hippocampus, mine 
and everyone’s, fix all the unsolvable problems
in countries that don’t exist on a map, origami 
god, boiled fox, how the new translation left out my 
crimes, and how much better I liked it that way, 
my carrion crown finally slackening a bit"
Invocation,"Let me be buried in the rain
In a deep, dripping wood,
Under the warm wet breast of Earth
Where once a gnarled tree stood.
And paint a picture on my tomb
With dirt and a piece of bough
Of a girl and a boy beneath a round, ripe moon
Eating of love with an eager spoon
And vowing an eager vow.
And do not keep my plot mowed smooth
And clean as a spinster’s bed,
But let the weed, the flower, the tree,
Riotous, rampant, wild and free,
Grow high above my head."
Emancipation,"Fling out your banners, your honors be bringing,
Raise to the ether your paeans of praise.
Strike every chord and let music be ringing!
Celebrate freely this day of all days.
Few are the years since that notable blessing,
Raised you from slaves to the powers of men.
Each year has seen you my brothers progressing,
Never to sink to that level again.
Perched on your shoulders sits Liberty smiling,
Perched where the eyes of the nations can see.
Keep from her pinions all contact defiling;
Show by your deeds what you’re destined to be.
Press boldly forward nor waver, nor falter.
Blood has been freely poured out in your cause,
Lives sacrificed upon Liberty’s altar.
Press to the front, it were craven to pause.
Look to the heights that are worth your attaining
Keep your feet firm in the path to the goal.
Toward noble deeds every effort be straining.
Worthy ambition is food for the soul!
Up! Men and brothers, be noble, be earnest!
Ripe is the time and success is assured;
Know that your fate was the hardest and sternest
When through those lash-ringing days you endured.
Never again shall the manacles gall you
Never again shall the whip stroke defame!
Nobles and Freemen, your destinies call you
Onward to honor, to glory and fame."
"It happened just like this for you, too, didn’t it?","You could not have been happier,
not a dancer, but did a jig in our courtyard
to the sweet streams of doo wop.

The innocent harmony of the Deltones,
and in 40 days you’d be staring at a ceiling
in an Emergency Room at Mt. Sinai Hospital.

This could be just like that …
Seeing double is worse than seeing single
It could be a precursor to a stroke

It could be anything, an interruption in service
of a perfectly working eye that gives up
that takes a powder when you least expect it.

That roars out of the station into a crash
against a wall, a motorcar, a vision that
decomposes, disintegrates, breaks down

into pixels, but this was not that.
This was seeing two, double vision, one eye
just as life was opening its third eye, letting

me see what I could do in this life without you
the fallow air around your grave that I never
visit, imagine, the whole thing a big mistake

as long as there is no marker, no one can find
you because you are not really there anymore.
I dressed you in the wrong jacket, not your

favorite shirt, but one a high school friend envied.
Why still after all this time, do I remember of all things,
I sent you away in an ill-fitting but new jacket

I knew I’d never give it away, I’d never wear it, I tossed
it into the coffin with your grandmother’s rosary beads,
your holy card to Vito Marcantonio, God only knows

what else I placed in the coffin, knowing even as
I neared that powdery skinned man in that box
that you had already left, that pain was gone."

Lime brief, and haze

For revolutionaries

Youth Insatiate,"If I have wished for skies unscarred by storm,
Shrunk from the grievous bitterness of things,
The days’ perplexities, the nights’ unrest,
The cruel, fruitless beating with clipped wings
Against the windows of the Infinite,
And, weary with the conflict’s puerile stress,
Cried out against it all, cried out for peace,
Even what peace the rotting dead possess,
May Life forgive me: I am stronger now,
The play bewilders, but I know my part;
And I have learned that Beauty is salt blood
Pain-wrung from the unconquerable heart.
Let there be laughter then, love’s wine and bread,
The many mouths of passion, their joys, their grief;
These are but soil and seed—for what grave growths?
I plant and wait, (and pray the time be brief!)
Lean wisdom this, to pause and taste and pause
Like a scared virgin who must stop for breath.
Take the cup simply, drain it to the lees;
Then, smiling, fling the empty cup to Death."
Disillusionment,"The agonies of disillusionment are the growing-pains of Truth
Now I am done with ineffectual dreams,
Kindly play-toys of the unsure years,
And unencumbered, proud and free and light,
With even pulses and a lifting heart,
I mount the future’s twisting stairs.
A week ago I thought that I must die,
Or hang forever, bitter as frost-killed fruit,
Scarred and broken from the Tree of Life —
Because I suddenly came into my sight
And men walked as trees; and dreams went mute.
’T is no small thing, to lose a dear, sure world,
To stumble, desolate, through hideous space,
Down unfamiliar and unfriendly roads
That bruise your feet. And then to suddenly feel
A great light newly shining in your face."
Ecstasy,"Stars, turn from your courses,
Stars, stars, I want you,
Spill into my hands.
I have found a new loneliness,
A new strong loneliness,
That no one understands.
I know a new joy, stars,
A joy of the still peak,
The wonder of airs knife-sharp;
Stars, I have learned to know them,
I have learned the tongue they speak.
Stars, I can understand them,
All the words they say,
All the subtle things.
They teach me exaltation,
A new intoxication
Fine drawn as the music of harp-strings.
Alone … alone … alone …
Stars, I can hear my skin breathe,
Hear my blood beat.
How can flesh be so light,
Feet walk and touch nothing,
Thought become so fleet?
Time is a rhymeless poem
Without any end Written in space,
Here at the world’s summit
Where life-giving winds
Sharply whip one’s face.
Life is the one reality,
Life intensely realized,
Life wildly felt;
Death is an ungrasped dream,
A vague monstrous fable,
A puzzle still unspelt.
Alone … alone … alone …
No other thing that breathes
In this keen place.
O my new joy,
Joy of singing summits,
Of endless, vibrant space!
Stars, stars, stoop down,
Stars, turn from your courses,
Spill into my hands!
Stars, you are my kindred:
I am strong with a new loneliness
That no one understands."
From the Top of the World,"Come to me at the top of the world,
O Mine, before the years spill
Our rare love into Time’s cup
And give our will to Time’s will.
My wide basin is full of starlight,
My moon is lighted with new fire,
I have lit every sun in the firmament
With the hurting flame of my desire.
The worms there in the valley
Die—to forget death!
But here at the top of the world
I laugh under my breath.
There is pain here, and tears,
Bitter, terrible tears;
But the joys have warm mouth, and madness
Dances downwards with the years.
Come to me at the top of the world,
O Mine. The valley is deep,
The valley is full of the dying,
And with those that sleep.
But here wonderful winds blow
And the pines sing one song.
Come to me at the top of the world,
Come soon. I have waited too long."
Love's Acolyte,"Many have loved you with lips and fingers
And lain with you till the moon went out;
Many have brought you lover’s gifts;
And some have left their dreams on your doorstep.
But I who am youth among your lovers
Come like an acolyte to worship,
My thirsting blood restrained by reverence,
My heart a wordless prayer.
The candles of desire are lighted,
I bow my head, afraid before you,
A mendicant who craves your bounty
Ashamed of what small gifts he brings."
The Poet,"We are given pain to balance every joy,
We tragic-eyed divinities in dust.
Many the hearts life bleeds with little wounds,
The souls bewildered between God and lust.
We know the way of pity and pity's pain;
We know the unlit, endless street called Doubt;
And few but walk a black way at the end,
The piteous, hope-lit candles dead, burned out.
Yet these are mortal wounds of mortal thorns:
What of the few who suffer deadlier scars?
They are worse wounded than any in the world
Who bruise their lifted heads against the stars."
As Usual,"You say you will not think of me:
You shut me out and count your beads,
The chaplet of your rules and doubts,
But lovers never think of creeds.
You’ll fill your mind with serious things:
You’ll think of God or Infinity,
Of a lover whose last charm is gone,
Of anything in the world but me.
Yet every thought will lead you back,
Infinity grow far and dim,
And God, with His sense of irony,
Will never let you think of Him."
A Happy Song,"Heaped sweets and a treasure
For a new sin to play with,
To pass a night and day with––
Heaped sweets for a pleasure.
Who and who will win them?
Who will carry virtue’s pall?
Of what use are sins at all
If someone does not sin them?
Who will take the treasure?
Run and run on light-winged feet;
Who will buy my sweetest sweet
With a new found pleasure?"
Declaration,"I am a seed in the dust,
A live root bedded in night,
And I am filled with a lust
For something the worms call light.
From what seed-pod I was blown
Matters little to me,
Why and by whom I was sown
Or what the reaping may be.
I only wait for my hour
When I shall be done with night,
When I shall thrill into flower
And drink till I die of light."
This Is Not Love,"This is not love: we cannot call it love.
Love would make me aware of infinite things,
Drive me down the spirit’s vast abyss
And through the narrow fastnesses of pain.
This is not love. Yet it holds loveliness
Beyond mere pleasure. Peace and passion both
Grow from the kiss with which I paint drab hours.
It is not love: love is for the gods
And our more godlike moments. Yet when stars
Withhold their splendor, why should we not light
Candles to warm with kindly mortal flames
The all-enfolding, cold, immortal night?"
Despair,"I can laugh now.
Have you not heard my laughter?
It leads the winds:
They come tumbling and bubbling after.
I have learned to laugh.
I have learned to laugh with my spirit
And with my soul.
Listen. Do you not hear it?
I shall quench the world.
I shall sear the stars with my laughter;
Shrivel the moon and the sun
And make new ones after.
For life’s skeleton
I shall make flesh from desires;
Then of my mounting laughter
Build it a temple with mocking spires.
I shall laugh to heaven.
I shall laugh below hell and above.
I shall laugh forever.
It was laughter God died of."
Experience,"Now you are gone I kiss your dented pillow
And wonder if it hungers like my breast
For the dear head we both have held in rest.
I said once: Love alone cannot assuage
My thirst, my hunger, love has no reply
For that wild questioning, for this fierce cry.
I said: there is no kiss can feed me now.
Perhaps love is life’s flower: I seek the root.
Yea, I have loved and love is dead sea fruit.
Yet, I lie here and kiss your dented pillow,
A trembling girl who loves you overmuch––
A harp in anguish for the player’s touch."
The Hole in My Curtain,"It is because of the hole in my curtain.
I have stared through the torn space
Into Life’s tortured face
As she leaned low and treadled her loom,
Watching, watching for inevitable doom.
And I have seen the haggard shadows flit
Over the tapestries she wove, bit by bit
Feverishly, her lips shrieking gay lies;
And always the tired song in her endless eyes.
I have watched the Form with his weary
            cynical face,
His pale smile, his definite, measured pace,
Gliding forward and gliding back like a
thing condemned
        from end to end.
And calmly slitting Life's woven cloths
And they have wondered that I should laugh!
Marvelled at the potent wines I quaff.
Marvelled that I should dance on their God's
            dried flesh,
Shape a lute from a bone of His; weave a mesh
Of mirthless melody; that I should find Sin fair,
Circle her body and sleep in her odorous hair.
They have marveled that I should mock the day,
Throw my veil over the sun and smile at Fate's
             old play;
Lead my soul down the ribald, flowered path.
They have marveled. . . they have wondered
that I should laugh.
                    in my curtain.
I have looked too long through the hole."
Episode,"I have robbed the garrulous streets,
Thieved a fair girl from their blight,
I have stolen her for a sacrifice
That I shall make to this mysteried night.
I have brought her, laughing,
To my quietly sinister garden.
For what will be done there
I ask no man’s pardon.
I brush the rouge from her cheeks,
Clean the black kohl from the rims
Of her eyes; loose her hair;
Uncover the glimmering, shy limbs.
I break wild roses, scatter them over her.
The thorns between us sing like love’s pain.
Her flesh, bitter and salt to my tongue,
I taste with endless kisses and taste again.
At dawn I leave her
Asleep in my wakening garden
(For what was done there
I ask no man’s pardon.)"
I Must Be Far,"I must be far from men and women
To love their ways.
I must be on a mountain
Breathing greatly like a tree
If my heart would yearn a little
For the peopled, placid valley.
I must be in a bare place
And lonely as a moon
To find the graceless ways of people
Worthful as a flower’s ways,
A flower that lives for loneliness
And dies when beauty dies.
I cannot find music
On the tongues of men and women
Unless I hear their voices
Like echoes, silence-softened.
Their many words mean little.
Their mouths are blatant sparrows.
I must be far from men and women,
As God is far away,
To keep my faith with Beauty,
My heart sweet towards them,
And love them with a god’s tranquility."
Roots,"O heavily weighing earth! O grim travail
In sunless silence with no hope of light!
O impotent wine! O bracken-food of pain!
I accept you all. I accept the timeless blight
Of crawling like a worm with unclean things,
Of being forever a yearning voiceless root
Bedded in this unwarmed oblivion
So that the great sun mellow my ultimate fruit."
Futility,"Under all beauty that I know,
All vital dreams,
Sharp loveliness,
Under the hair, the lips of laughter,
The dusk-dim eyes of pain,
Lurks the single thing I fear,
Hard-mouthed, implacable-eyed,
The monster,
The satyr-thing, futility.
I cannot look on loveliness
Or burn the flame of ecstasy,
Or even dream for very long,
Without the annihilating fear
That it will suddenly tear some veil
And bare its dreadful face.
When I am light with the exaltation
Mysteriously born of worship,
Filled like a cup with the wine of wonder
At some great cloudy bloom of color,
Or learning the infinite secrets of rapture
With bared heart held to love’s lips—
Light’s eyes are suddenly blinded,
Life gropes in empty twilight,
And the mocking mouth of the satyr-thing
Leers at me from a veil of dust.
Shuddering I crouch to earth,
Trembling lest it come more near,
Trembling lest it stretch a hand
And touch me! Choked by an agony
Of horror lest its deadly eyes
Should shrivel my flaming heart of dream.
Sometimes I think the universe,
Mind, passion, beauty, wisdom, light,
All fathomless life-wonders,
Serve only for its cloak.
It lurks like death in everything
That has a singing heart:
In all exultant voices,
In all desire’s burning eyes,
In youth’s true soul,
In love’s slim hands,
Sometimes I think it is life’s core,
This mocking-mouth’d implacable ghost.
Sometimes I think it is life’s core.
Sometimes I think it must be God."
Come And Lie With Me,"Come and lie with me and love me,
Bitterness.
Touch me with your hands a little,
Kiss me, as you lean above me,
With your cold sadistic kisses;
Wind your hair close, close around me,
Pain might dissipate this blankness.
Hurt me even, even wound me,
I have need of love that stings.
Come and lie with me and love me,
Bitterness.
So that I may laugh at things."
Oversoul,"My laughter rings in the highest mountains,
My mockery echoes vividly over the peaks,
My laughter and my mockery dance lightly together
Like derisive imps… But my soul never speaks.
My wisdom sits on a promontory
And remotely overwatches the world;
My pain stays forever in that cave
Where the ragged ends of life come unfurled.
My love cuts downward between mountains
Like a torrential, cataract, to the deeps,
For love, like life, is a down-going.
But my soul is like a thing that sleeps.
It knows the remorseless depths,
The thinnest ether of the farthest height;
There are no lights or darkness for its discovering
It has crawled on the earth and it knows the joy of flight
It is speechless because it knows all speeches,
Future and present and what has gone before.
It waits sphinxlike, and I myself
Cannot guess what it is waiting for."
Grain and Grapes,"This word came to me
From one whose wisdom shapes
The destiny of many:
Let your thought be fruitful:
Men like grain and grapes.
I’ll not be loved of men for my gifts
If men want grain and grapes alone:
My thoughts are gnarled, fantastic trees,
Grown up untended, barely pruned,
From ancient seed I have not sown.
Their snake-mouthed roots are in my heart.
I feel them hungrily intense
Drawing the seething love-sap out.
Prodigally I feed them all
My being’s vivid affluence.
But thus far they have only borne
Veined blue buds that bloom to be
Scarred flowers of inhuman pain,
And little opening leaves, like eyes
Full of a grave futility.
Strange flowers foretell strange fruit
And gods stay breathless while they grow
Men call and look for grain and grapes,
Their homely, humble earth-warm fruits;
But heaven is silent. The gods may know."
Two-An’-Six,"Merry voices chatterin’,
Nimble feet dem patterin’,
Big an’ little, faces gay,
Happy day dis market day.
Sateday, de marnin’ break,
Soon, soon market-people wake;
An’ de light shine from de moon
While dem boy, wid pantaloon

An’ de mule cant’ in de track
Wid him tail up in him back,
All de ketchin’ to defy,
No ca’ how dem boy might try.
In de early marnin’-tide,
When de cocks crow on de hill
An’ de stars are shinin’ still,
Mirrie by de fireside
Hots de coffee for de lads
Cornin’ ridin’ on de pads
T’rown across dem animul—

Which at last had come do’n cool.
On de bit dem hol’ dem full:
Racin’ ober pastur’ lan’,

Comin’ fe de steamin’ tea
Ober hilly track an’ lea.’
Hard-wuk’d donkey on de road
Trottin’ wid him ushal load,
Hamper pack’ wi’ yam an’ grain,
Sour-sop, and Gub’nor cane.
Cous’ Sun sits in hired dray,
Drivin’ ’long de market way;
Whole week grindin’ sugar cane
T’rough de boilin’ sun an’ rain,
Now, a’ter de toilin’ hard,
He goes seekin’ his reward,
While he’s thinkin’ in him min’
Of de dear ones lef’ behin’,
Of de loved though ailin’ wife,
Darlin’ treasure of his life,
An’ de picknies, six in all,
Whose ’nuff burdens ’pon him fall:
Seben lovin’ ones in need,
Seben hungry mouths fe feed;
On deir wants he thinks alone,
Neber dreamin’ of his own,
But gwin’ on wid joyful face
Till him re’ch de market-place.
Sugar bears no price today,
Though it is de mont’ o’ May,
When de time is hellish hot,
An’ de water cocoanut
An’ de cane bebridge is nice,
Mix’ up wid a lilly ice.
Big an’ little, great an’ small,
Afou yam is all de call;
Sugar tup an’ gill a quart,
Yet de people hab de heart
Wantin’ brater top o’ i’,
Want de sweatin’ higgler fe
Ram de pan an’ pile i’ up,
Yet sell i’ fe so-so tup.
Cousin Sun is lookin’ sad,
As de market is so bad;
’Pon him han’ him res’ him chin,
Quietly sit do’n thinkin’
Of de loved wife sick in bed.
An’ de children to be fed—
What de laborers would say
When dem know him couldn’ pay;
Also what about de mill
Whe’ him hire from old Bill;
So him think, an’ think on so,
Till him t’oughts no more could go.
Then he got up an’ began
Pickin’ up him sugar-pan:
In his ears rang t’rough de din
“Only two-an’-six a tin’.”
What a tale he’d got to tell,
How bad, bad de sugar sell!
Tekin’ out de lee amount,
Him set do’n an’ begin count
All de time him min’ deh doubt
How expenses would pay out;
Ah, it gnawed him like de ticks,
Sugar sell fe two-an’-six!
So he journeys on de way,
Feelin’ sad dis market day;
No e’en buy a little cake
To gi’e baby when she wake—
Passin’ ’long de candy-shop
’Douten eben mek a stop
To buy drops fe las’y son,
For de lilly cash nea’ done.
So him re’ch him own a groun’.
An’ de children scamper roun’,
Each one stretchin’ out him han’,
Lookin’ to de poor, sad man.
Oh, how much he felt de blow,
As he watched dem face fall low,
When dem wait an’ nuttin’ came,
An’ drew back deir han’s wid shame!
But de sick wife kissed his brow:
“Sun, don’t get down-hearted now;
Ef we only pay expense
We mus’ wuk we common-sense,
Cut an’ carve, an’ carve an’ cut,
Mek gill sarbe fe quattiewut;
We mus’ try mek two ends meet
Neber mind how hard be it.
We won’t mind de haul an’ pull,
While dem pickny belly full.”
An’ de shadow lef’ him face,
An’ him felt an inward peace,
As he blessed his better part
For her sweet an’ gentle heart:
“Dear one o’ my heart, my breat’,
Won’t I lub you to de deat’?
When my heart is weak an’ sad,
Who but you can mek it glad?”
So dey kissed an’ kissed again,
An’ deir t’oughts were not on pain,
But was ’way down in de sout’
Where dey’d wedded in deir yout’,
In de marnin’ of deir life
Free from all de grief an’ strife,
Happy in de marnin’ light,
Never thinkin’ of de night.
So dey k’lated eberyt’ing;
An’ de profit it could bring,
A’ter all de business fix’,
Was a princely two-an’-six."
Commemoration,"When first your glory shone upon my face
   My body kindled to a mighty flame,
And burnt you yielding in my hot embrace
   Until you swooned to love, breathing my name.
And wonder came and filled our night of sleep,
   Like a new comet crimsoning the sky;
And stillness like the stillness of the deep
   Suspended lay as an unuttered sigh.
I never again shall feel your warm heart flushed,
   Panting with passion, naked unto mine,
Until the throbbing world around is hushed
   To quiet worship at our scented shrine.
Nor will your glory seek my swarthy face,
   To kindle and to change my jaded frame
Into a miracle of godlike grace,
   Transfigured, bathed in your immortal flame."
“So Quietly”,"News item from the New York Times on the lynching of a Negro at Smithville, Ga., December 21, 1919: “The train was boarded so quietly . . . that members of the train crew did not know that the mob had seized the Negro until informed by the prisoner’s guard after the train had left the town . . . A coroner’s inquest held immediately returned the verdict that West came to his death at the hands of unidentified men.”
So quietly they stole upon their prey
And dragged him out to death, so without flaw
Their black design, that they to whom the law
Gave him in keeping, in the broad, bright day,
Were not aware when he was snatched away;
And when the people, with a shrinking awe,
The horror of that mangled body saw,
“By unknown hands!” was all that they could say.
So, too, my country, stealeth on apace
The soul-blight of a nation. Not with drums
Or trumpet blare is that corruption sown,
But quietly—now in the open face
Of day, now in the dark—and when it comes,
Stern truth will never write, “By hands unknown.”"
Epilogue,"Why are you laughing, Poet?
I much prefer your sighs.
I myself have just read one of your songs
And tears are biting my eyes.
And why should I not laugh?
I cleaned my heart of its dust,
Swept my spirit clear of its cobwebs,
Gathered them up and thrust
Them from me. And then
Men passing, found the whole,
Called them songs and sang them and exulted.
They thought they had found my soul."
A Thought,"There are more songs in the far corners
           of my soul
Than I shall ever be able to sing.
I shall go away long before they are
           all expressed
And they will wait for another life, for
           more suffering,
To give them birth; another life and many
           more tears
And love, to make them open their eyes to
           the light.
It will take many lives to express all
           the songs
I hear singing to themselves day and night."
Before Sleep,"There is an autumn sadness upon me,
A sadness of bared trees,
And mist and delicate death of flowers.
There is an autumn sadness upon me,
A falling of leaves in my soul.
There is an autumn sadness upon me,
A dreamfulness in my heart,
And a wistful sense of longing.
There is faint moaning music
Like cries of departing birds.
There are trembling hands on my eyelids,
A dim foreknowledge of tears
And dreams, patterning ultimate slumber.
There is an autumn sadness upon me,
A falling of leaves in my soul."
Loneliness,"This loneliness encaged in me
That has no curious heart for life,
No ribald blood, no treacherous flesh
Nor golden wickedness of song,
This loneliness that prays in me,
Is it not somewhat like a nun?
See the clasped hands, the secret eyes,
The lips pressed close for fear of love!
What if I make her drunk one day
With wine or some unholy need
Then leave the cell door open wide––
Think you she might be tempted out?"
Chance,"Strange that a single white iris
Given carelessly one slumbering spring midnight
Should be the first of love,
Yet life is written so.
If it had been a rose
I might have smiled and pinned it to my dress:
We should have said Good Night indifferently
And never met again.
But the white iris!
It looked so infinitely pure
In the thin green moonlight.
A thousand little purple things
That had trembled about me through
          the young years
Floated into a shape I seem always to have known
That I suddenly called Love!
The faint touch of your long fingers on mine
          wakened me.
I saw that your tumbled hair was bright
          with flame,
That your eyes were sapphire souls with
          hungry stars in them,
And your lips were too near not to be kissed.
Life crouches at the knees of Chance
And takes what falls to her."
To a Young Dancing Girl,"Golden-eyed girl, do you see what I see?
Do you see behind the veil that Life
           laughs through?
Golden-eyed girl, I would like to laugh
           with you.
But my veil is torn, and I see things pass
Like shadows in the depths of a crystal glass.
Golden-eyed girl, you are young as springtime,
Your great eyes are dreamful, your rare
           lips sweet.
Shadows matter little to youth with dancing feet
All of Life’s skeletons wear gay dresses
And youth is deceived by even Death’s caresses.
Golden-eyed girl, you have years to dance and
           wonder
Before your Life’s curtain will wear into holes
And let you see the hopelessness hidden in souls.
You have many moons of laughter, many
           years to go
Before you’ll learn how heavy dancing feet
           can grow."
Poppy Song,"Love in a garden of poppies
Playing at living life,
Love with smiles in her speech,
Love dancing at dawn
In a garden of flushed pink poppies.
Love, unsmiling now,
At noon in the garden of poppies,
With a laugh under her eyelids,
Fear deep in her eyes,
And tangled with her hair,
Sighs and a struggling joy.
Love, with a dim, strained face,
At night in the garden of poppies,
Her lips crushing the bloom
From the fairest flower there.
Love drunk with the wine
She has drawn from the poppy’s heart:
Love with death at her breasts.
Love at the end of night
Shaded by drooping poppies;
Love with scattered hair
And strange stains on her lips.
Love with death at her breasts."
Dawn,"Dawn opens like a great gold flower,
Petal by monstrous petal,
Quivering minute by minute,
Hour by hour.
Stretches great live leaves over hundreds
           of hills,
Scatters flakes of pollen dust into a
           few valleys,
Drops a loose petal down where a slender
           waterfall spills.
Morning opens like a gold flower,
Stirs and quivers singingly at the feet of the day;
Shoots transparent light into a moving mist
That wrists spirally
Like a butterfly at play.
In the heart of the mist, morning opens, a
           gold flower,
Superbly, like a dawning passion.
Can night be the consummation
Of this expectant white hour?"
Chant of Spring,"Like an unhappy woman Earth frees herself
          from the arms of Winter,
Surely Winter, her indifferent Lord,
Whose touch is death to her passionate body,
And, weeping, yields to Spring, the
          wooing maiden,
The slim girl who kisses her with
          awakening kisses,
Burning her lips and eyelids with flaming mouth
          loosed upon them,
Renewing her body with wildness
          of young caresses,
Holding her close while the reckless hours dance
          to death.
              ·        ·              ·        ·                ·        ·
                   ·                       ·                        ·
Wan passion flowers growing in hidden places,
Memories,
Kisses given by the slim maiden.
Wan passion flowers,
All that is left to Earth of her maddest lover."
The Face in the Rain,"O form! O face!
Elfin face in the crowd!
Form, face, white throat,
Pale throat wound with a scarf
Poppy red,
Blood-like, red,
Pale throat wound with a poppy scarf
Gleaming out of the crowd.
             Background of grey,
             A rain-wet street;
             Shuffling; shambling
             Beating feet,
             Past the corner where four ways meet.
O face, O throat!
Crimson and white
Splashed on grey:
I have thought of nothing else all day.
             Misted streets,
             A scarf-wound throat,
             Fay-like face
             That seemed to float
             Through the crowd
             Like a wisp of song:
             I have thought of them all day long."
Relinquishment,"Go her way, her quiet, quiet way,
Her way is best for one so wistful-tired.
My three-months’ lover, go with your
            world-sick heart,
Your love-bruised flesh. I am no sanctuary.
This hot mouth, these ardent, out-reaching arms,
This hollow between my breasts, these
            hungry limbs,
They are a cradle, a cradle of living flame;
No haven for you, saddening after peace.
I am not certain, no, nor soothing-safe.
Mine is the shifting, perilous way of life.
Pitiless, ever-changing, hazardous,
My love insatiate and mutable.
Go her way, her quiet, well-path’d way,
Sit by her hearth-fire; let her keep you safe.
Mine the unharbored heart, the uncharted
            passions;
Mine, at the end a more than common peace."
Mnasidika,"I shall not harm you at all nor ask you
        for anything,
You need have no fear;
I am only very tired and would like to
        rest awhile
With my head here
And play with the long strands of your
        loosed hair,
Or touch your skin,
Feel your cool breath on my eyes,
        watch it stir
Those rising hills where your breasts begin;
And listen to your voice whispering
        tender words
Until, perhaps, I fall asleep;
Or feel you kiss my forehead to comfort me
        a little
If I should weep.
That is all, just to lie so beside you
Till dawn's lamp is lit.
You need not fear me. I have given
        too much of love
Ever to ask for it."
World Cry,"There are gods in the market place. 
Did you know there were gods there? 
All, yes. Gods, gods,
There are gods everywhere.
I think the many like gods,
I think they like to pray and mourn. 
For a joy-song their prophets sing:
“A new God will soon be born!”
For a joy-song I would sing:
“Let every god be down-torn.”
But what is the world muttering?
Has she whispered it since life began? 
“Gods! I want none of your gods.
Look to yourself—Man.”"
Grey Skies,"I like grey skies,
At least they tell the truth;
Grey skies,
Reflective skies
That do not laugh at all
Nor weep vain tears.
Unpromising,
Unhoping,
Cold.
Grey skies,
No fear in them
Nor any joy,
No tragedy,
All grey.
I like grey skies,
Unweeping, smileless skies.
They do not lie."
The Friend Departs,"'Tis not alone that you have gone from me:
All the hungry, fragile roots of hope
Are blasted by a Thing I cannot name;
And I am desolate remembering
The rare kiss, the intimate silent climbing
From passion to a breathless comprehension.
Even my peace of heart, born of long pain,
Dies, drowned in a turbulence of passion.
Life today is like a glass reflecting
Nothing more than my own grieving eyes,
Or like a goblet that I sit and stare at,
Empty of all but stains of last night's wine."
Constancy,"You're jealous if I kiss this girl and that.
You think I should be constant to one mouth.
Little you know of my too quenchless drouth.
My sister, I keep faith with love, not lovers.
Life laid a flaming finger on my heart,
Gave me an electric golden thread,
Pointed to a pile of beads and said:
Link me one more perfect than the rest.
Love's the thread, my sister, you a bead,
An ivory one, you are so delicate.
These first burned ash-grey—far too passionate.
Farther on the colors mount and sing.
When the last bead's painted with the last design
And slipped upon the thread, I'll tie it so,
Then smiling quietly, I'll turn and go
While vain Life boasts her latest ornament."
When Love Becomes a Stranger,"When Love becomes a stranger
In the temple he has built
Of remembered nights and days,
When he sighs and turns away
From the altar in the temple
With unreturning feet,
When the candles flicker out
And the magical-sweet incense
Vanishes . . .
Do you think there is grief born
In any god's heart?"
Love Sleep,"Watch my Love in sleep:
Is she not beautiful
As a young flower at night
Weary and glad with dew?
Pale curved body
That I have kissed too much,
Warm with slumber's flush;
Breasts like mounded snow,
Too small for children's mouths;
Lips a red spring bud
My love will bring to bloom.
How restlessly she moves!
She, no more than a child,
Stirs like a woman troubled
With guilt of secret sins.
Twin furtive tears
Glide from the shadows,
Her eyes' shadowed blue.
Her dreaming must be sad.
What grief to watching love
That it is impotent,
For all its reckless strength,
When the sleep gates close."
Market Maze,"Faces, faces...
Restless faces and restless hands, 
Not the divine restlessness 
Of seeking, singing spirits.
Not the impatient restlessness 
Of a creature mad for wings.
But a feeble thing,
A futile thing:
The restlessness of the market place, 
The fever of buying and selling."
Life's Leaders,"Their clouded wine, their whited bread,
We cannot take and call it good;
Yet sorrier fare Life grudges us 
Who have no taste for common food.
We must go hungry long life through, 
Aching and hungry to the end;
Betrayed by pity into chains 
Reason tries vainly to transcend.
Are we not sadly prodigal?
We spend ourselves without restraint;
Yea, we let Beauty break our hearts 
And bleed for love until we faint.
Yet it is not the thorns, the shame,
Not the hurt body’s weak distress:
Our bitterest crucifixion lies 
In man’s abject unworthiness.
From Life’s rough cloth and flying threads,
From dust, from passion, dreams and pain, 
From the dear madness men call love,
From faith that lies beyond the brain,
We shape the only deathless soul 
That mortal man will ever know.
Behold his gratitude, these stones.
They say ‘t is by the heart we grow.
Still we build quietly and wait.
The heart may break; the heart is frail; 
But a stern, strange ecstasy 
Befriends us; and we dare not fail.
The Hand that points the solemn way 
May be a wanton hand at best;
The great Word echoing in our souls 
May be a bored God’s casual jest.
We cannot guess. We only know 
‘T is written by some awful Pen 
We must be torches sacrificed 
To light the way for lesser men."
The Islands of Africa,"     to Rimbaud
Two pages to a grape fable
dangles the swan of samite blood
shaping sand from thistle covered fog
Over sacred lakes of fever
(polished mouths of the vegetable frog
rolling to my iron venus)
I drop the chiseled pear
Standing in smoke filled valleys
(great domains of wingless flight
and the angel’s fleshy gun)
I stamp the houses of withering wax
Bells of siren-teeth (singing to our tomb
refusal’s last becoming)
await the approach of the incendiary children
lighting the moon-shaped beast
Every twisted river pulls down my torn-out hair
to ratless columns by the pyramid’s ghost
(watered basin of the temple stink)
and all the mud clocks in haste
draw their mermaid-feather swords
(wrapped by Dust) to nail them
into the tears of the sea-gull child
The winter web minute
flutters beneath the spider’s goblet
and the whores of all the fathers
bleed for my delight."
Hope,"You would win me, woo me, win me,
To be your lover, Hope!
You would lure me, charm me, lure me, 
With all your deathless youth!
You would have me worship, adore you, 
Build my life for you;
Mould my moments into hours 
Out of your careless smile!
How you pursue me, woo me, follow,
Like a light-headed girl.
All the world is your willing lover:
What do you want with me?
You are a wanton, lovely, perfect,
A dazzling thing like day,
Draped with silk things,
Tasselled, jewelled,
Hung about with veils;
Painted with sweet lies men have blended 
Of folly and dreams and fear.
You are a wanton, all men’s mistress: 
What do you want with me?
What are your gifts worth, light bestower?
All lips know your kiss.
What is your word worth, soft-tongued liar? 
You have deceived all men.
Why do you follow, woo me, follow,
Like a light-headed girl?
What can I give you? What can you give me? 
What do you want with me?
Painted wanton! Tasselled Houri!
Gay in your dress of shame!
You are all men’s willing mistress.
What do I want with you?"
Youth,"I must go down,
Down, down,
Below the crusts of things,
Under the shadows,
Into thought-haunted places 
Where few go;
Where the road is broken 
And travelled by monsters,
Truths with hard sphinx-faces.
I must go down 
Into the caves of life,
Into the darknesses,
Deep, deep,
Below the good of things,
Below the evil of things,
Where the calm roots of wisdom creep.
I must tunnel
Under the bloom of dreams,
Under the frame-work of fancies, 
Tunnel alone.
What if I shatter frail things,
Break delicate flowers of myth 
Timorous dreamers have sown?
I must go down
Below narrow roads men have made, 
Below bridging lies men have built, 
Into the caverns of truth.
I know pain is waiting there 
Eager to break me,
But I am strong.
I have faith in my youth.
Living is crusted with lies.
I want life naked,
Laughing and young.
Not fettered, not tamed,
But life unashamed,
With the cry of Desire on her tongue."
The Grey Thread,"My life is a grey thread,
A thin grey stretched out thread, 
And when I trace its course, I moan: 
How dull! How dead!
But I have gay beads.
A pale one to begin,
A blue one for my painted dreams, 
And one for sin,
Gold with coiled marks,
Like a snake’s skin.
For love an odd bead 
With a deep purple glow;
A green bead for a secret thing 
That few shall know;
And yellow for my thoughts 
That melt like snow.
A red bead for my strength,
And crimson for my hate;
Silver for the songs I sing 
When I am desolate;
And white for my laughter 
That mocks dull fate.
My life is a grey thread 
Stretching through Time’s day;
But I have slipped gay beads on it 
To hide the grey."
Celestial Estrangement,"We have been carried here against our will
Burnt stars
Oceanic gardens
where the clouds are soaked into my eyes
How much sand floats in the teacup of your dreams
The rivers you perceive are those of horses
they carry red water
the odor of imperishable sweat
putrescent human bellies stuffed with revolvers and nuns
At the top of the tower
where hounds part with a pool of water
where one comes only with a flaming lance
where there is no escaping the pain of a horse’s kick
where toy dolls are nailed to the beds
where lovers suck their bodies dry
as harp strings are plucked away
in this hermit world of old gunny sacks and broken heads
we encounter tons of wingless birds"
Lines from “The Vision of Lazarus”,"Another sate near him, whose harp of gold
Had sounded in the tents of Israel,
His robes were woven from the cloth of Tyre
And golden sandals bound his olive feet.
“I am that David, he whose psalms ye sing
When sounds the timbrel in the plains of Gad.
My garments, washed of every crimson stain,
I am a wearer of the laurel wreath,
My heart as free as when in Bethlehem
I caused the blades of grass to dance with glee;
My soul each eventide goes forth with God,
A humble servant to His mystic will;
And in the morning do I wander wide,
Along the cool of every haunt and vale.
There lies a still brook deep in Heaven’s land
Where milk-white sheep may stray and quench their thirst,
And there I nurse my memories of one
I wooed when in the house of lordly Saul.
A virgin like the rose when glides the wind
From out the Southland in the old year’s noon.”"
A poem for tea heads,"I sit in Lees.     At 11:40 PM with
Jimmy the pusher. He teaches me
Ju Ju.
           Hot on the table before us
shrimp foo yong, rice and mushroom
chow yuke.
         Up the street under the wheels
of a strange car is his stash—The ritual.
We make it.     And have made it.
For months now together after midnight.
Soon I know the fuzz will inter-
rupt will arrest Jimmy and
I shall be placed on probation.
                                               The poem
does not lie to us. We lie under its
law, alive in the glamour of this hour
able to enter into the sacred places
of his dark people, who carry secrets
glassed in their eyes and hide words
          under the roofs of their mouth. "
The New Day,"From a vision red with war I awoke and saw the Prince of
        Peace hovering over No Man’s Land.
Loud the whistles blew and the thunder of cannon was
        drowned by the happy shouting of the people.
From the Sinai that faces Armageddon I heard this chant
        from the throats of white-robed angels:
   Blow your trumpets, little children!
   From the East and from the West,
   From the cities in the valley,
   From God’s dwelling on the mountain,
   Blow your blast that Peace might know
   She is Queen of God’s great army.
   With the crying blood of millions
   We have written deep her name
   In the Book of all the Ages;
   With the lilies in the valley,
   With the roses by the Mersey,
   With the golden flower of Jersey
   We have crowned her smooth young temples.
   Where her footsteps cease to falter
   Golden grain will greet the morning,
   Where her chariot descends
   Shall be broken down the altars
   Of the gods of dark disturbance.
   Nevermore shall men know suffering,
   Nevermore shall women wailing
   Shake to grief the God of Heaven.
   From the East and from the West,
   From the cities in the valley,
   From God’s dwelling on the mountain,
   Little children, blow your trumpets!
From Ethiopia, groaning ’neath her heavy burdens, I heard
        the music of the old slave songs.
I heard the wail of warriors, dusk brown, who grimly
        fought the fight of others in the trenches of Mars.
I heard the plea of blood-stained men of dusk and the
        crimson in my veins leapt furiously.
  Forget not, O my brothers, how we fought
  In No Man’s Land that peace might come again!
  Forget not, O my brothers, how we gave
  Red blood to save the freedom of the world!
  We were not free, our tawny hands were tied;
  But Belgium’s plight and Serbia’s woes we shared
  Each rise of sun or setting of the moon.
  So when the bugle blast had called us forth
  We went not like the surly brute of yore
  But, as the Spartan, proud to give the world
  The freedom that we never knew nor shared.
  These chains, O brothers mine, have weighed us down
  As Samson in the temple of the gods;
  Unloosen them and let us breathe the air
  That makes the goldenrod the flower of Christ.
  For we have been with thee in No Man’s Land,
  Through lake of fire and down to Hell itself;
  And now we ask of thee our liberty,
  Our freedom in the land of Stars and Stripes.
I am glad that the Prince of Peace is hovering over No Man’s Land."

Not Complete Enough,"How my Mother’s embroidered apron unfolds in my life

As I put out my cigarette tonight in bed
    I thought of my mother,
      how she would lie
                                    in the dark
      her bed and as a boy I wd
                                              open
      the open and see the red spot in her hands.
        I thought of my mother tonight
                 when I put out my cigarette 
         in the dark bed,
           stomping it out
                                    and her in
             how I would open the door at night
             and see the red thing in her hands,
                 and now a man
                 I have the red thing
                   and it is the last thing
                 I do.  
                          The last thought that
                   the house is clean,
                    was her thought mine 
             tonight in her home,
                         red thought
             the two of us in the dark, 
                                           thoughts of the day,
                 the clock right, the window open,
                               how many lunches made,
                                                            my life so apart
      And yet in her hands.
          How I lie in her hand
               and her head turns
        its circle, over the day
                             in my head.
         Tonight after midnight
             my mother and the gesture
             I make with my last
             cigarette her gesture,
             how I wd help her upstairs
           when she got drunk on holidays
              in terror help her
              and always she’d ask for the
            last cigarette and fall asleep
            with it and I wd handle
                          the details,
            two pillows, window open, and the door
                          a crack so we could hear
                            her if she fell out
                                         of bed.
                    And she did and another cigarette
         with her gray hair knotted on the pillow

With Mr. J. R. Morton,"For our nerves
this drink, a beating
on our nerves
no shakedown our heads
but of our nerves
I wish I was a dancer
and cd. move
in feet/undo my body
swing it out it
bangs my bubbs and belly
slide my toes in pebbles so
my nerves
wd. be taken up one by
one stretched out
tight thin to threads
and I wd. be free
inside my legs. My head
not snapped by a King Porter stomp
or played like
Jelly Roll
bends.
Ah daddy I wanna be drunk many days.
On a stage in front of beautiful eyes
I wd. remove my rags,
my dress drop
to work the curtain,
to dance out softly
(over their heads) barefoot on wood
softly
toes like vaseline
knee dips as I strip out my—
I desire to be taken to the top of the Liberty Bell and blown
by winds from Sweden
softly and my toes would do it if I
were a dancer. "
You Are Not She,"You are not she I loved. You cannot be
           My wild, white dove, 
My tempest-driven dove that I gave house, 
           You cannot be my Love. 

She died. I used to hold her all night long; 
           Come awake
At dawn beside her. Try to ease with loving 
            A thirst too deep to slake. 

O, it was pain to keep her shut against me. 
           Honey and bitterness
To taste her with sharp kisses and hold her after
            In brief duress. 

You cold woman, you stranger with her ways, 
         Smiling cruelly, 
You tear my heart as never her wild wings’
                   beating 
                            Wounded me. "
Philosophy,"Since we must soon be fed
As honey and new bread
To every-hungry Death:
O, love me very sweet 
And kiss me very long
And let us use our breath 
For song. 
Nothing else endures
Overlong. "
Late Autumn Afternoon,"Grey, fingered with flickering threads
           of light; 
Silence broken by restless quavers
           of music. 
Greyness, music, 
A playing thought of slumber. 
And on my lips faintly disturbing fingers, 
And at my heart love’s hand like a 
           child’s hand
Stirring me half awake. "
Love Song,"My love, you destroy me, you rend, 
          You tear me apart. 
You are a wild swan I have caught
          And housed in my heart. 

My sister, my love, I am shattered, 
           Broken, dismayed. 
The live wings, the wild wings are beating, 
            They make me afraid.

Fold your wings, brood like a dove, 
         Be a dove I can cherish
More calmly, my dear, my tempestuous love, 
          Or I perish. "
Sudden Friendship,"Yesterday we walked apart, 
Separate and cold and mortal. 
Now the mystic kiss has joined us, 
Now we stand inside the portal

That permits of no returning,
And my heart is strangely burning. 

I know not what the word may be, 
Or what the charm, or what the token, 
That has filled us with this glory. 
But never let the charm be broken. 

Let it stay a mystery
For all time to be. 

Yesterday, with lighter joys,
We wantoned at the outer portal. 
Now, with love’s old alchemy, 
We have made ourselves immortal. "
The Artist,"Let us leave off loving, Madonna: 
You have kissed me grey
And still I have no peace. 
We thought we could make the night
A tapestry of passion. 
Dear Love! What a vain caprice. 
Where’s the immortal design
We thought we had splashed on the indigo cloth? 
And where is the cloth? 
Dawn is forever the cynic. 
He shows us love is the flame, 
Our flesh the eternal moth. 
Madonna. . . loose me and rise. 
We are brief as apple-blossom
And I am heart-weary with the thought of the end. 
Creation is all. 
The hours are thieves, Time a beggar, 
And we have little to spend. 
I ache for the brush in my hand. 
The thrall of the compliant pigment
Governs my blood. 
I will paint you, Madonna, 
The afterglow in your face; 
I would deify you if I could
With enchantments of color, 
Bind you with fetters of terrible beauty
Fast to my canvas forever, 
Give you the eternality God has denied you, 
Bind you to life with art’s sacred chains
That death cannot sever. 
Love has betrayed us enough with its treacherous wonder: 
Let us go now while we ache with the magic
Or what is the gain? 
Art is our one immortality, 
All we may win from the gods 
In exchange for our labor and pain. "
Fifty Years,"(1863–1913)
On the Fiftieth Anniversary of the Signing of the Emancipation Proclamation
O brothers mine, today we stand
    Where half a century sweeps our ken.
Since God, through Lincoln’s ready hand.
    Struck off our bonds and made us men.
Just fifty years—a winter’s day—
    As runs the history of a race;
Yet, as we look back o’er the way,
    How distant seems our starting place!
Look farther back! Three centuries!
    To where a naked, shivering score,
Snatched from their haunts across the seas,
    Stood, wild-eyed, on Virginia’s shore.
For never let the thought arise
    That we are here on sufferance bare;
Outcasts, asylumed ’neath these skies.
    And aliens without part or share.
This land is ours by right of birth,
    This land is ours by right of toil;
We helped to turn its virgin earth,
    Our sweat is in its fruitful soil.
Where once the tangled forest stood—
    Where flourished once rank weed and thorn—
Behold the path-traced, peaceful wood,
    The cotton white, the yellow corn.
To gain these fruits that have been earned,
    To hold these fields that have been won,
Our arms have strained, our backs have burned,
    Bent bare beneath a ruthless sun.
That Banner which is now the type
    Of victory on field and flood—
Remember, its first crimson stripe
    Was dyed by Attucks’ willing blood.
And never yet has come the cry—
    When that fair flag has been assailed—
For men to do, for men to die.
    That we have faltered or have failed.
We’ve helped to bear it, rent and torn,
    Through many a hot-breath’d battle breeze
Held in our hands, it has been borne
    And planted far across the seas.
And never yet—O haughty Land,
    Let us, at least, for this be praised—
Has one black, treason-guided hand
    Ever against that flag been raised.
Then should we speak but servile words,
    Or shall we hang our heads in shame?
Stand back of new-come foreign hordes,
    And fear our heritage to claim?
No! stand erect and without fear,
    And for our foes let this suffice—
We’ve bought a rightful sonship here,
    And we have more than paid the price.
And yet, my brothers, well I know
    The tethered feet, the pinioned wings,
The spirit bowed beneath the blow,
    The heart grown faint from wounds and stings;
The staggering force of brutish might,
    That strikes and leaves us stunned and dazed;
The long, vain waiting through the night
    To hear some voice for justice raised.
Full well I know the hour when hope
    Sinks dead, and round us everywhere
Hangs stifling darkness, and we grope
    With hands uplifted in despair.
Courage! Look out, beyond, and see
    The far horizon’s beckoning span!
Faith in your God-known destiny!
    We are a part of some great plan.
Because the tongues of Garrison
    And Phillips now are cold in death,
Think you their work can be undone?
    Or quenched the fires lit by their breath?
Think you that John Brown’s spirit stops?
    That Lovejoy was but idly slain?
Or do you think those precious drops
    From Lincoln’s heart were shed in vain?
That for which millions prayed and sighed,
    That for which tens of thousands fought,
For which so many freely died,
    God cannot let it come to naught."
Brothers,"See! There he stands; not brave, but with an air
Of sullen stupor. Mark him well! Is he
Not more like brute than man? Look in his eye!
No light is there; none, save the glint that shines
In the now glaring, and now shifting orbs
Of some wild animal caught in the hunter’s trap.
    How came this beast in human shape and form?
Speak, man!—We call you man because you wear
His shape—How are you thus? Are you not from
That docile, child-like, tender-hearted race
Which we have known three centuries? Not from
That more than faithful race which through three wars
Fed our dear wives and nursed our helpless babes
Without a single breach of trust? Speak out!
    I am, and am not.
            Then who, why are you?

    I am a thing not new, I am as old
As human nature. I am that which lurks,
Ready to spring whenever a bar is loosed;
The ancient trait which fights incessantly
Against restraint, balks at the upward climb;
The weight forever seeking to obey
The law of downward pull—and I am more:
The bitter fruit am I of planted seed;
The resultant, the inevitable end
Of evil forces and the powers of wrong.
    Lessons in degradation, taught and learned,
The memories of cruel sights and deeds,
The pent-up bitterness, the unspent hate
Filtered through fifteen generations have
Sprung up and found in me sporadic life.
In me the muttered curse of dying men,
On me the stain of conquered women, and
Consuming me the fearful fires of lust,
Lit long ago, by other hands than mine.
In me the down-crushed spirit, the hurled-back prayers
Of wretches now long dead—their dire bequests—
In me the echo of the stifled cry
Of children for their bartered mothers’ breasts.
    I claim no race, no race claims me; I am
No more than human dregs; degenerate;
The monstrous offspring of the monster, Sin;
I am—just what I am. . . . The race that fed
Your wives and nursed your babes would do the same
Today, but I—
                  Enough, the brute must die!
Quick! Chain him to that oak! It will resist
The fire much longer than this slender pine.
Now bring the fuel! Pile it ’round him! Wait!
Pile not so fast or high! or we shall lose
The agony and terror in his face.
And now the torch! Good fuel that! the flames
Already leap head-high. Ha! hear that shriek!
And there’s another! Wilder than the first.
Fetch water! Water! Pour a little on
The fire, lest it should burn too fast. Hold so!
Now let it slowly blaze again. See there!
He squirms! He groans! His eyes bulge wildly out,
Searching around in vain appeal for help!
Another shriek, the last! Watch how the flesh
Grows crisp and hangs till, turned to ash, it sifts
Down through the coils of chain that hold erect
The ghastly frame against the bark-scorched tree.
    Stop! to each man no more than one man’s share.
You take that bone, and you this tooth; the chain—
Let us divide its links; this skull, of course,
In fair division, to the leader comes.
    And now his fiendish crime has been avenged;
Let us back to our wives and children.—Say,
What did he mean by those last muttered words,
“Brothers in spirit, brothers in deed are we”?"
Stepping into the Sea,"You let me, your stepmother, 
Take your hand to walk  
into the surf, let 
slippery seaweed wrap  
around your ankles  
like emerald ribbons. 

We step on the edge  
of lacey waves that feel 
like butter on hot skin.  

You hold back, your mother’s 
fear of the sea, fear of me,  
sways you. She warns you  
Yemaya, the Santeria god, 
will swallow you into the sea 
here in Puerto Rico, la isla bonita,
land of your Borinquen bloodline. 

I tip the balance, study Santeria,
pin a benevolent picture  
of Yemaya on my bulletin board, 
so she will know who we are. 

Queen of the Ocean, Mother, 
Yemaya, savior of sailors,  
Spirit of moonlight, 
She will protect you, I swear, 
as she does sailors in stormy seas. 

Tall, lean in silver drapery,  
she shows up in New Orleans hoodoo, 
In Brazil, her wizened face, a walnut, 
In Venezuela, I find  
a child-size likeness of her,  
but am afraid to bring it home, 
its eyes too lifelike. 

Today, we are in Puerto Rico.
We weave our fingers together, 
dig our toes into the sea floor 
sandy and firm underfoot, 
enter the sea of your ancestors."
We,"         Like that day in February—crisp, sharp cloudless
           it’s like that today when winter refuses to fade.

       The sheets over and under you, creaseless like the sky.

     I bend over your hospital bed, release the railing between us
                        in silence we call mercy into the room."
O Black and Unknown Bards,"O black and unknown bards of long ago.
How came your lips to touch the sacred fire?
How, in your darkness, did you come to know
The power and beauty of the minstrel’s lyre?
Who first from midst his bonds lifted his eyes?
Who first from out the still watch, lone and long,
Feeling the ancient faith of prophets rise
Within his dark-kept soul, burst into song?
Heart of what slave poured out such melody
As “Steal away to Jesus”? On its strains
His spirit must have nightly floated free,
Though still about his hands he felt his chains.
Who heard great “Jordan roll”? Whose starward eye
Saw chariot “swing low”? And who was he
That breathed that comforting, melodic sigh,
“Nobody knows de trouble I see”?
What merely living clod, what captive thing,
Could up toward God through all its darkness grope,
And find within its deadened heart to sing
These songs of sorrow, love and faith, and hope?
How did it catch that subtle undertone,
That note in music heard not with the ears?
How sound the elusive reed so seldom blown,
Which stirs the soul or melts the heart to tears.
Not that great German master in his dream
Of harmonies that thundered amongst the stars
At the creation, ever heard a theme
Nobler than “Go down, Moses.” Mark its bars
How like a mighty trumpet-call they stir
The blood. Such are the notes that men have sung
Going to valorous deeds; such tones there were
That helped make history when Time was young.
There is a wide, wide wonder in it all,
That from degraded rest and servile toil
The fiery spirit of the seer should call
These simple children of the sun and soil.
O black slave singers, gone, forgot, unfamed,
You—you alone, of all the long, long line
Of those who’ve sung untaught, unknown, unnamed,
Have stretched out upward, seeking the divine.
You sang not deeds of heroes or of kings;
No chant of bloody war, no exulting pean
Of arms-won triumphs; but your humble strings
You touched in chord with music empyrean.
You sang far better than you knew; the songs
That for your listeners’ hungry hearts sufficed
Still live,—but more than this to you belongs:
You sang a race from wood and stone to Christ."
Transformation & Escape,"1
I reached heaven and it was syrupy.
It was oppressively sweet.
Croaking substances stuck to my knees.
Of all substances St. Michael was stickiest.
I grabbed him and pasted him on my head.   
I found God a gigantic fly paper.
I stayed out of his way.
I walked where everything smelled of burnt chocolate.   
Meanwhile St. Michael was busy with his sword   
hacking away at my hair.
I found Dante standing naked in a blob of honey.   
Bears were licking his thighs.
I snatched St. Michael’s sword
and quartered myself in a great circular adhesive.   
My torso fell upon an elastic equilibrium.
As though shot from a sling
my torso whizzed at God fly paper.
My legs sank into some unimaginable sog.
My head, though weighed with the weight of St. Michael,   
did not fall.
Fine strands of multi-colored gum
suspended it there.
My spirit stopped by my snared torso.
I pulled! I yanked! Rolled it left to right!
It bruised! It softened! It could not free!
The struggle of an Eternity!
An Eternity of pulls! of yanks!
Went back to my head,
St. Michael had sucked dry my brainpan!
Skull!
My skull!
Only skull in heaven!
Went to my legs.
St. Peter was polishing his sandals with my knees!   
I pounced upon him!
Pummeled his face in sugar in honey in marmalade!   
Under each arm I fled with my legs!
The police of heaven were in hot pursuit!
I hid within the sop of St. Francis.
Gasping in the confectionery of his gentility   
I wept, caressing my intimidated legs.
2
They caught me.
They took my legs away.
They sentenced me in the firmament of an ass.
The prison of an Eternity!
An Eternity of labor! of hee-haws!
Burdened with the soiled raiment of saints
I schemed escape.
Lugging ampullae its daily fill
I schemed escape.
I schemed climbing impossible mountains.
I schemed under the Virgin’s whip.
I schemed to the sound of celestial joy.
I schemed to the sound of earth,
the wail of infants,   
the groans of men,   
the thud of coffins.   
I schemed escape.
God was busy switching the spheres from hand to hand.   
The time had come.
I cracked my jaws.   
Broke my legs.
Sagged belly-flat on plow
on pitchfork
on scythe.
My spirit leaked from the wounds.
A whole spirit pooled.
I rose from the carcass of my torment.   
I stood in the brink of heaven.
And I swear that Great Territory did quake   
when I fell, free.
 "
My Love,"My love has hair
Like midnight,
But midnight fades to dawn.
My love has eyes
Like starlight,
But starlight fades in morn.
My love has a voice
Like dew-fall,
But dew-fall dies at a breath.
My love has love
Like life’s all,
But life’s all fades in death."
Mentally missturbed,
our general banality,"was sex and more of it. sex and talk of it. sex and sexuality and sexism. until some among us began to differentiate it. prefix and suffix it. label it a matter of preference, genetic reconnaissance at birth. and it was it and it was not it. until some among us began to psalm. and what about doing it. and when would we do it to each other again. and it was gratuitous. the blue and white lament of it. until it moved us into ecological proximity. what was near and how loud. the flesh budding, ripening. it had always been a matter of proximity. the what it is was close to us. lewd and it was common. consumptive and it was money. extractive and it was public.

it was a wave, it was infectious

sharp pointed arrows indicate the lack of an end

Bird in Hand,"Being asked to move into time 
To places wishes and daydreams 
Into rivets and seams
Being asked to move back into categorical understandings of regrets
In order to fight against disintegration 
Carrying a placeholder for liminal spectrums

Move me, unmove me
place me unto y’all’s metaphoric understanding 
of the dreams which have yet been realized
Wish unto me, unfurl around, open
Gasp gasp gasp 
Cry out, there are ways of understanding 
that leave indelible marks onto membrane surfaces

To not function

The throat struggles to open
The ears seek love remarks
The skin wrinkles

you have my best 
and my sword to cut through the meat of life.

Stanzas from The Fledging Bard and The Poetry Society,"Part 1
I’m out to find the new, the modern school,
Where Science trains the fledgling bard to fly,
Where critics teach the ignorant, the fool,
To write the stuff the editors would buy;
It matters not e’en though it be a lie,—
Just so it aims to smash tradition’s crown
And build up one instead decked with a new renown.
A thought is haunting me by night and day,
And in some safe archive I seek to lay it;
I have some startling thing I wish to say,
And they can put me wise just how to say it.
Without their aid, I, like the ass, must bray it,
Without due knowledge of its mood and tense,
And so ’tis sure to fail the bard to recompense.
Will some kind one direct me to that college
Where every budding genius now is headed,
The only source to gain poetic knowledge,
Where all the sacred truths lay deep imbedded,
Where nothing but the genuine goods are shredded,—
The factory where they shape new feet and meters
That make poetic symbols sound like carpet beaters.
• • • • • • •
I hope I’ll be an eligible student,
E’en though I am no poet in a sense,
But just a hot-head youth with ways imprudent,—
A rustic ranting rhymer like by chance
Who thinks that he can make the muses dance
By beating on some poet’s borrowed lyre,
To win some fool’s applause and please his own desire.
Perhaps they’ll never know or e’en suspect
That I am not a true, a genuine poet;
If in the poet’s colors I am decked
They may not ask me e’er to prove or show it.
I’ll play the wise old cock, nor try to crow it,
But be content to gaze with open mind;
I’ll never show the lead but eye things from behind.

There goes a wench, a poor live human scrag,
Half crushed beneath the freight of seventy years.
With pail and scrub-brush, soapine and a rag,
To polish marble halls and dirty stairs.
I believe most times she cleans them with her tears,
Ah me, that’s civilization at its height,
Democracy’s full moon, obscured in darkest night.

Our President is not a fighter,
    He is too proud to shoulder arms,
He is a scholar and a writer
    Who woos a wealthy widow’s charms.
• • • • • • •
The President,
A high-toned gent,
The darling son
Of Washington;
Has got the wit,
He makes a hit,
With campaign stuff
Of Yankee bluff.
• • • • • • •
He wields his English and his grammar,
    His textbook and his rhetorics;
His words rain blows like a trip-hammer
    And cut much ice in politics.
He’s getting wordier not wiser
    In trained and skilled diplomacy;
He holds the maniac-champ the Kaiser
    To strict accountability.
Come, Woody, quit your honeymooning;
    The Austrians have sunk a boat;
Cut out your wooing and your spooning.
    Get busy, write another note!

The house of God is nigh forever closed,
While that of Baal is always open wide,
A poor religious zeal is here exposed,
Which thus reflects a lack of Christian pride.

As in a trice from heaven to hell they leap;
The devil works overtime while ministers hug sleep

We hail thee, land of liberty.
Star of our hope and destiny
Where long we’ve been and long must be
In freedom’s fabled place.
We bless thee, land, in love’s sweet name
Whereto as slaves our fathers came,
Where still we struggle lashed and lame,
As exiles torn from Grace.
The Scotchman tunes his pipe and drum,
Old Ireland’s Harp is never dumb,
We make our rag-time banjo hum
To Uncle Sam’s swift pace.
We follow where his footsteps lead,
We copy him in word and deed,
E’en though his low and vicious creed
Our morals should debase.
With him we hail the stripes and stars,
The stripes that stand for color bars,
The stars that burn and leave their scars
On our black bleeding race.

Some think this Negro question is a joke,
Exploited by their leaders for mere gain;
They have no time to fool with colored folk,
Who seem to show more energy than brain,
Who’re always fighting, raising hell and cain
Among themselves; each wants a different leader,
They know no more their wants than donkeys know their breeder.
Some look to Booker Washington to lead them,
Some yell for Trotter, some for Kelly Miller,
Some want Du Bois with fat ideas to feed them,
Some want Jack Johnson, the big white hope killer.
Perhaps some want Carranza, some want Villa,
I guess they want social equality,
To marry and to mix in white society.
• • • • • • •
This is the white man’s country,
And he must bear the sway;
The Negro is an outcast,
Who happens here to stray;
He bears upon his forehead
The badge of negligence,
By chance he drifted hither,
So he must live by chance.
The people rejoice to hear the nations say,
“The whites alone must bear the sway.”
This is the native rampart
Of Nature’s chosen sons,
While ’tis the haunted prison
Of her despised ones.
This is the fruitful Eden
Where fortune bids us dwell,
This is the white man’s heaven,
But ’tis the Negro’s hell.
The people laugh while all the nations yell,
“The white man’s heaven is the black man’s hell.”

I have a problem all alone to solve,
A problem how to find the poetry club,
It makes my sky piece like a top revolve,
For fear that they might mark me for a snob.
They’ll call me poetry monger and then dub
Me rustic rhymer, anything they choose,
Aye, anything at all, but heaven’s immortal muse.
Great Byron, when he published his Childe book,
In which he sang of all his lovely dears,
Called forth hot condemnation and cold look,
From lesser mortals who were not his peers.
They chided him for telling his affairs,
Because they could not tell their own so well,
They plagued the poet lord and made his life a hell.
They called him lewd, vile drunkard, vicious wight,
And all because he dared to tell the truth,
Because he was no cursed hermaphrodite—
A full-fledged genius with the fire of youth.
They hounded him, they hammered him forsooth;
Because he blended human with divine,
They branded him “the bard of women and of wine.”
Of course I soak the booze once in a while,
But I don’t wake the town to sing and shout it;
I love the girls, they win me with a smile,
But no one knows, for I won’t write about it.
And so the fools may never think to doubt it,
When I declare I am a moral man,
As gifted, yet as good as God did ever plan."

"A Shropshire Lad, XXX","Others, I am not the first,
Have willed more mischief than they durst:
If in the breathless night I too
Shiver now, ’tis nothing new.
More than I, if truth were told,
Have stood and sweated hot and cold,
And through their reins in ice and fire
Fear contended with desire.
Agued once like me were they,
But I like them shall win my way
Lastly to the bed of mould
Where there’s neither heat nor cold.
But from my grave across my brow
Plays no wind of healing now,
And fire and ice within me fight
Beneath the suffocating night."
There Is a Black Fly in Your Chardonnay,"Outside, I have never been lonesome,
Always a fence, a plank, an eyebrow in the ocean,
A baby received in a house, anything tall is a tree.
The sky rearranges itself in the desert;
The sky rearranges itself in the water;
The sky rearranges itself while I am in the sky.
How lucky I thought I was to see the street lights turn on,
Clouds like rows of planting, mistakes we make and agree to continue,
A view of the river, my rock in the glade,
Bigger, relatively, and still, until,
I pull my lover open like a zipper,
I drag a trowel through them,
I lick the paint off my own stick,
I have a cold back and wet ankles.
Later, a slow moon laboring over the hillside;
Later, the fog reflects the moon;
Later, my blood is sucked and I itch.
Will we will we ever find home? 
The car calls us in the distance,
To walk the stairs, to take off my shoes, to stand 
Wringing hands, scratching grass blades on toenails. 
You are starting to see things we could never see before like:
You have been born,
Or how I waited a whole year for September,
A piece of fruit,
A source of fire,
An edge, an excuse on a small scrap of paper,
The woods in my mouth.
It is so hot today like yesterday and the day before."
sky hammer,"I took my sky hammer &
pounded out a few choice
clouds, cirrus and I don’t know, nimbus
as in a god on earth
moving in space as a great auroral mist
a god who beholds the sparrows 
washing in the dusty gravel
of frankford avenue
giving me cause to rant or
giving me means to roll
ride with me in the shadowy afterworld
beyond the spider of a doubt
along a sidewalk littered w/ leaves
don’t be plain, said the cloud, find
the ornament that please you best
or elsewise, sugared in stars
go on and rail in a useless manner
against the inevitable dawntime
people of the dawn
come up drumming 
and beat on a pillow even
if a drum is not available
happy fortune, fortune has come round for you again
in this pocket world of a minor horned god 
I balanced my lunch 
in the arms of my ancestors
thomcord grapes and weeping cherries
they were my arms
lackadasic in the sky-sky-sky
holding their sky hammer
as if it were the baby buddha
and I thought, if there was a world beyond...
I could become one of those assholes 
who gets their sugar from fruit
and regard the one who points out my faults 
as a revealer of treasures
and regard the one who points out my faults 
as a revealer of treasures"
Fagus sylvatica ‘Pendula’,"Lying hymn-barren on the dirt floor, loopy 
in the leaflight, I thought I thought well of myself.
I smoked a cigarette beneath the weeping beech 
we called King Tree, dreamt 
a grove grown for coffinwood.
Pain journeyed from my stomach riding an armored horse.
Vines grew around my neck.
The world was worse wherever I was."
Klangfarbenmelodie,"clock that measures the opposite of time
ancient pixel built from half a breath
the seed of a perfect moon
numbers don’t lie because they can’t tell the truth
the kindling space between a choice
& its airless shadow
a polite noumenon guides my dismay
with the grace of email for doves
originating in silence like all eternal things
joystruck demon of rain
the welas at the bus stop look like potatoes
in cellophane       the milk of their laughter
Anaisa’s mirror is her palm
a plangent yellow, bones of song
tracing lines of flight"

Of a Certain Friendship,"Odd how you entered my house quietly,
Quietly left again.
While you stayed you ate at my table,
Slept in my bed.
There was much sweetness,
Yet little was done, little said.
After you left there was pain,
Now there is no more pain.
But the door of a certain room in my house
Will be always shut.
Your fork, your plate, the glass you drank from,
The music you played,
Are in that room
With the pillow where last your head was laid.
And there is one place in my garden
Where it’s best that I set no foot."
Sweet Are The Dreams on The Breeze-Blown Strand,"Sestine Enchainée
When autumn cloudlets fleck the sky
    Straying southward like birds o’er the sea,
      When the flickering sunlight on the dunes
          Is pale, as seagrasses kissed by the spray,
           Seagrasses that knew the summer of yesterday–
             Sweet are the dreams on the breeze-blown strand!
Sweet are the dreams on the breeze-blown strand!
   When cloud skiffs skim athwart the sky
       And like a phantom of yesterday
          The light house shimmers out to sea
             Pale as the sand and the sea-worn spray
               And the straggling sunlight on the dunes.
Like straggling sunlight on the dunes,
  Like opal surges that wash the strand
    With briny fragrance, adoom with the spray,
        Like wander-birds that career the sky
          To flowerlit isles of some Southern sea-
            Such are the dreams of yesterday!
Alas, our dreams of yesterday,
   Frail as the fragrance of the dunes,
     Vain as dark jewels of the sea
        Cast up on some glimmering strand,
          They vanish like cloud sails on the sky,
             Pale as seagrasses frowsed by the spray.  
Pale as seagrasses kissed by the spray,
   Is all this life of yesterday,
    All our longings for clear blue skies
       For the low cool plash on autumn dunes,
          All our musings on tide-left strands
             While birds wing southward o’er the sea.
Like birds winging southward o’er the sea
   Scattered in air-like wasteful spray,
     Sea-fancies fading on lonesome strands
       Weary of storm drifts of yesterday,
           Thus our thoughts on the sea-scooped dunes
              When autumn cloudlets fleck the sky.
Oh, autumn-sea under a cloud-flecked sky
   As caressed are thy dunes with opal spray
      So shimmer in dreams on the breeze-blown strand
         Sweet long-lost summers of yesterday."
Love By The Sea #2,"The waves have lost their silvery note,
   White birds of dreams o’er the dim plain start,
       Through the mist is gliding a phantom bark––
          What made love open its eyes and part!
Where are the sweet names we whispered low,
    Were they carried away by the breeze?
        The vain words which from our lips did flow
           Are they buried forever in dismal seas?
             And the kisses that rained on your face
                Has nothing remained of their ardent glow?
                   The night holds nothing but a cold embrace,
                      The sun of our love sank low.
Only the note of the seabird rings
   Through the dim realm of night and mist,
      Not a breath of our past love clings
         To this sea of faded amethyst,
           Even the wind pauses in space
              And refuses to caress our lips;
                 Alas, our love was of fleeting pace
                    Like the visions of seafaring ships.
Like the flash of a meteor’s flight,––
  Know we whither its glow has flown;
      Its sped across heaven with radiant light
       And vanished in worlds unknown––
          So the sweet hours have passed away
            Like flowers that on the sand-dunes grow,
               Like waves that die in a wreath of spray
                  When bitter winds over the shoreland blow."
Dawn-Flowers,"to Maurice Maeterlinck
Weird phantoms rise in the dawn-winds blow,
   In the land of shadows the dawn-flowers grow;
      The night-worn moon yields her weary glow
         To the morn-rays that over the dream-waste flow.
Oh, to know what the dawn-wind murmurs
   In chapels of pines to the ashen moons;
What the forest-well whispers to dale and dell
   With her singular, reticent runes;
To know the plaint of each falling leaf
   As it whirls across the autumnal plain;
To know the dreams of the desolate shore
   As sails, like ghosts, pass o’er the dawnlit main!
                     To know, oh, to know
       Why all life’s strains have the same refrain
                              As of rain,
              Beating sadly against the window pane.
      We do not know and we can not know,
      And all that is left for us here below
      (Since ""songs and singers are out of date"")
      And the muses have met with a similar fate)
            Is to flee to the land of shadows and dreams,
                    Where the dawn-flowers grow
                     And the dawn-winds blow,
            As morn-rays over life’s dream-waste of flow
              To drown the moon in their ambient glow.
                       Envoy
Oh, gray dawn-poet of Flanders,
   Though in this life we ne’er may meet,
      I'll linger where thy dream-maids wander
         To strew these dawn-flowers at their feet."
Twilight Hours,"                                    I
The colors of the rainbow are fading in the silent
      and distant West, and the heartache of
      twilight trembles within my aching breast.
   For the light of my love has faded like sunbeams
         in the West, and the color of twilight will
         tremble forever in my breast.
                                   II
I think of thy kindness often, when lonesome I feel
      and cold, I have not forgotten our childhood,
      nor your loving words of old.
   And still my sweetest songs of life are floating
         in dreams to thee, like whisperings at eventide,
         across a clouded sea.
                                   III
We two are sitting in the bark, and listen to the
      wavelets’ play, the shore is melting in the
      dark, day’s echoes silently decay.
   Oh life, with all thy hopes so fair, wilt thou
         too float away, like visions rising in the
         air that greet the parting day!
                                   IV
She stands amidst the roses, and tears dart from her
      eyes that like the fragrant roses her soul
      must fade and die.
   He stares at the twilight ocean on the shore of a
         foreign land, a faded rose is trembling
         within his soft white hand.
                                   V
The rushes whisper softly, the sounds of silence wake,
      large flowers like sad remembrance float
      on the dark green lake.
   Were life but like the waters, so bright and calm
         and deep, and love like floating flowers
         that on the surface meet.
                                   VI
The naked trees of autumn grope shivering through
      twilight’s gloom, athwart the whispering branches
      its dying embers loom.
   I dream of life’s defoliation, as I watch with
         silent dread, leaf after leaf departing, like
         hopes long withered and dead.
                                  VII
In haunting hours of twilight dreams restless the
      turbulent sea, and heaves her white wanton
      bosom in endless mystery.
   Dream on, dream on, titanic queen, beloved sea, at
         thy wanton breast, I would find rest
         in endless mystery."
Love By The Sea #1,"Far away from the murmuring town,
   In the region of sand and sea,
     Love has surprised us on the down–
        Love has surprised you and me–
           In this realm where sea-kissed grasses sway,
            Where winds at nightfall sadly moan,
               Where sea-gulls sing there plaintive lay.
                   And waves croon in minor monotone.
No flower grows in this land of dreams,
   No human habitation far or near
     Illumines the scene with a reddish gleam,
        All around is desolate and drear;
           Nothing but weeds and greyish sand–
            Yet the sea seems to say in an undertone;
               Until dawn whitens this wind-blown strand,
                   The treasures of night are all thy own!
And like waves that softly shoreward creep,
   Love draws us nigh as the hours pass,
     Thy breath is like wind in the weft of the grass;
        I feel thy bosom ebb and tide––
           Its paleness resembles the moonlit sea––
               And as sea and heaven together glide
                   Let thy sweetness be lost in me.
Do not be startled at the seabird’s cry
   Nor at the wind’s relentless blast
     Too soon the kiss on our lips will die,
        Alas, the joys of Venus never last!  
           Like flowers that droop on the sunburnt sward
               Our love must needs wither and fade,
                  Like blossoms that ars carried seawards
                     By the wind from some sleepy glade.
One joys of Venus never last,
   Love is naught but some dreamland lore,
      And as the hours are ebbing fast
         Our dream like seaweed, will be left on the shore;
            Already the cup of the autumn moon
               Floods with her gold the distant West,
                 The bitterness of life will dawn too soon,
                    Forlorn lies the sea-gull’s last year’s nest.
                         Perchance, some other autumn eye,
                         May greet us on this barren wold,
                         Not arm in arm, alone and fain,
                         Desirous of the days of old."
Sic Vita,"Heart free, hand free,
    Blue above, brown under,
All the world to me
    Is a place of wonder.
Sun shine, moon shine,
    Stars, and winds a-blowing.
All into this heart of mine
    Flowing, flowing, flowing!
Mind free, step free,
    Days to follow after,
Joys of life sold to me
    For the price of laughter.
Girl’s love, man’s love,
    Love of work and duty,
Just a will of God’s to prove
    Beauty, beauty, beauty!"
Sandy Star,"I
Sculptured Worship
The zones of warmth around his heart,
    No alien airs had crossed;
But he awoke one morn to feel
    The magic numbness of autumnal frost.
His thoughts were a loose skein of threads,
    And tangled emotions, vague and dim;
And sacrificing what he loved
    He lost the dearest part of him.
In sculptured worship now he lives,
    His one desire a prisoned ache;
If he can never melt again
    His very heart will break.
II
Laughing It Out
He had a whim and laughed it out
    Upon the exit of a chance;
He floundered in a sea of doubt—
    If life was real—or just romance.
Sometimes upon his brow would come
    A little pucker of defiance;
He totalled in a word the sum
    Of all man made of facts and science.
And then a hearty laugh would break,
    A reassuring shrug of shoulder;
And we would from his fancy take
    A faith in death which made life bolder.
III
Exit
No, his exit by the gate
    Will not leave the wind ajar;
He will go when it is late
    With a misty star.
One will call, he cannot see;
    One will call, he will not hear;
He will take no company
    Nor a hope or fear.
We shall smile who loved him so—
    They who gave him hate will weep;
But for us the winds will blow
    Pulsing through his sleep.
IV
The Way
He could not tell the way he came,
    Because his chart was lost:
Yet all his way was paved with flame
    From the bourne he crossed.
He did not know the way to go,
    Because he had no map:
He followed where the winds blow,—
    And the April sap.
He never knew upon his brow
    The secret that he bore,—
And laughs away the mystery now
    The dark’s at his door.
V
Onus Probandi
No more from out the sunset,
    No more across the foam,
No more across the windy hills
    Will Sandy Star come home.
He went away to search it
    With a curse upon his tongue:
And in his hand the staff of life,
    Made music as it swung.
I wonder if he found it,
    And knows the mystery now—
Our Sandy Star who went away,
    With the secret on his brow."
Sandy Star and Willie Gee,"Sandy Star and Willie Gee,
Count ’em two, you make ’em three:
Pluck the man and boy apart
And you’ll see into my heart."

Trying Too Hard to Write a Poem Sitting on the Beach,"Planted among driftwood
I watch the tide go out
It pulls the sundown with it
& across this scene & against the wind
Man on a motorbike white crash-helmet
His young son rides the gas tank before him
Slows down for the creek mouth
& not too fast up the beach north
Flat dull whistle buoy heard again
and though the wind is right the bell buoy is inaudible
Fat seagull picks at a new hake skeleton
Choosily—not hungry walks away
Returns a moment later,
Room for a few more bites inside
Here comes a family of five
Man prodding with a stick whatever the children test
                          with their fingers
Mama is bundled up naturally cold & yellow plastic bucket
Complaining a little “. . . kind of a long way from the car . . .”
The children explore ahead the beach goes on forever & they
Will see it all this evening they aren’t tired
Motorbike man coming back slows down for them
               & for the creek mouth
Fog joined into fat clouds cover the sun
Move south stretching rivers & islands of blue
Fine moving sheets & shafts of light on the water horizon
I’m not making it, I’m cold, I go into the house."
Homage to Robert Creeley,"What I thought
       was a fly on the window was
A knot on the branch outside
Near it a real fly sat
Quiet in the sun
Wind rocked all the branches the fly
       sat still"
Parfum Des Fleurs,"Oh, frail and fragrant visions,
   Sweet nomads of the air,
      That rise like the mist on the meadows
         And cling to my darksome hair.
Are ye the souls of roses,
   Of memory’s vagrom lays,
      Sent to caress my senses—
         Faint murmurs of bygone days?"
A triolet,"’Tis the first day of Spring!
 The catkins are a-bloom,
 The bluebirds are a-wing,
’Tis the first day of Spring!
 Faint scents the breezes bring;
 Man’s thoughts new shape assume.
’Tis the first day of Spring,
 The catkins are a-bloom!"
Immaculate Conception,"A maiden flower stands lonesome on a vast and
          desolate plain, in trembling fear that
          her longings for life and love prove vain.
But the passing breeze takes pity, it embraces
          some flowering plant and carries its golden
          riches to the bride of the desolate land.
Windstirred she tosses her clustering hair to the
          dust of golden glow, and flower-starred with
          the waxing morn the desolate meadows grow."
Why I No Longer Love Thee?,"                   Why I no longer love thee?
          Ask why summer has fled,
Thy autumn is dead with its garnet glow,
          Why the sea is gray, and the sky is gray;
          Why bitter gales o’er the salt flats blow,
Where the sea-fowl sport in ghoulish play
And the pods of the beach-pea stand withered
On the long-curved rifts of dream-torn sand;
          Why the shore is scarred by time’s rough hand,
                 And ships that heel on wintry seas
                       Are wrecked on the ashen strand!"
The Feet of Judas,"Christ washed the feet of Judas!
The dark and evil passions of his soul,
His secret plot, and sordidness complete,
His hate, his purposing, Christ knew the whole.
And still in love he stooped and washed his feet.
Christ washed the feet of Judas!
Yet all his lurking sin was bare to him,
His bargain with the priest, and more than this,
In Olivet, beneath the moonlight dim,
Aforehand knew and felt his treacherous kiss.
Christ washed the feet of Judas!
And so ineffable his love ’twas meet,
That pity fill his great forgiving heart,
And tenderly to wash the traitor’s feet,
Who in his Lord had basely sold his part.
Christ washed the feet of Judas!
And thus a girded servant, self-abased,
Taught that no wrong this side the gate of heaven
Was ever too great to wholly be effaced,
And though unasked, in spirit be forgiven.
And so if we have ever felt the wrong
Of Trampled rights, of caste, it matters not,
What e’er the soul has felt or suffered long,
Oh, heart! this one thing should not be forgot:
Christ washed the feet of Judas."
A Litany Of Atlanta,"     Done at Atlanta, in the Day of Death, 1906.
O Silent God, Thou whose voice afar in mist and mystery
hath left our ears an-hungered in these fearful days—
    Hear us, good Lord!
Listen to us, Thy children: our faces dark with doubt
are made a mockery in Thy sanctuary.   With uplifted
hands we front Thy heaven, O God, crying:
    We beseech Thee to hear us, good Lord!
We are not better than our fellows, Lord, we are but
weak and human men.   When our devils do deviltry,
curse Thou the doer and the deed: curse them as we curse
them, do to them all and more than ever they have done
to innocence and weakness, to womanhood and home.
    Have mercy upon us, miserable sinners!
And yet whose is the deeper guilt?   Who made these
devils?   Who nursed them in crime and fed them on in-
justice?   Who ravished and debauched their mothers and
their grandmothers?   Who bought and sold their crime,
and waxed fat and rich on public iniquity?
    Thou knowest, good God!
Is this Thy justice, O Father, that guile be easier than
innocence, and the innocent crucified for the guilt of the
untouched guilty?
    Justice, O judge of men!
Wherefore do we pray?   Is not the God of the fathers
dead?   Have not seers seen in Heaven’s halls Thine
hearsed and lifeless form stark amidst the black and rolling
smoke of sin, where all along bow bitter forms of
endless dead?
    Awake, Thou that sleepest!
Thou art not dead, but flown afar, up hills of endless
light, thru blazing corridors of suns, where worlds do
swing of good and gentle men, of women strong and
free—far from the cozenage, black hypocrisy and chaste
prostitution of this shameful speck of dust!
    Turn again, O Lord, leave us not to perish in our sin!
From lust of body and lust of blood,
    Great God, deliver us!
From lust of power and lust of gold,
    Great God, deliver us!
From the leagued lying of despot and of brute,
    Great God, deliver us!
A city lay in travail, God our Lord, and from her
loins sprang twin Murder and Black Hate.   Red was
the midnight; clang, crack and cry of death and fury filled
the air and trembled underneath the stars when church
spires pointed silently to Thee.   And all this was to sate
the greed of greedy men who hide behind the veil of
vengeance!
    Bend us Thine ear, O Lord!
In the pale, still morning we looked upon the deed.
We stopped our ears and held our leaping hands, but they
—did they not wag their heads and leer and cry with
bloody jaws: Cease from Crime!   The word was mockery,
for thus they train a hundred crimes while we do
cure one.
    Turn again our captivity, O Lord!
Behold this maimed and broken thing; dear God, it was
an humble black man who toiled and sweat to save a bit
from the pittance paid him.   They told him: Work and Rise.
He worked.   Did this man sin?   Nay, but some
one told how some one said another did—one whom he
had never seen nor known.   Yet for that man’s crime this
man lieth maimed and murdered, his wife naked to
shame, his children, to poverty and evil.
    Hear us, O Heavenly Father!
Doth not this justice of hell stink in Thy nostrils,
O God?   How long shall the mounting flood of innocent
blood roar in Thine ears and pound in our hearts for
vengeance?   Pile the pale frenzy of blood-crazed brutes
who do such deeds high on Thine altar, Jehovah Jireh,
and burn it in hell forever and forever!
    Forgive us, good Lord; we know not what we say!
Bewildered we are, and passion-tost, mad with the mad-
ness of a mobbed and mocked and murdered people;
straining at the armposts of Thy Throne, we raise our
shackled hands and charge Thee, God, by the bones of
our stolen fathers, by the tears of our dead mothers, by
the very blood of Thy crucified Christ: What meaneth
this?   Tell us the Plan; give us the Sign!
    Keep not Thou silence, O God!
Sit no longer blind, Lord God, deaf to our prayer
and dumb to our dumb suffering.   Surely Thou too art
not white, O Lord, a pale, bloodless, heartless thing?
    Ah! Christ of all the Pities!
Forgive the thought!   Forgive these wild, blasphemous
words.   Thou art still the God of our black fathers, and
in Thy soul’s soul sit some soft darkenings of the evening, some shadowings of the velvet night.
But whisper—speak—call, great God, for Thy silence
is white terror to our hearts!   The way, O God, show
us the way and point us the path.
Whither?   North is greed and South is blood; within,
the coward, and without, the liar.   Whither?   To death?
    Amen!   Welcome dark sleep!
Whither?   To life?   But not this life, dear God, not
this.   Let the cup pass from us, tempt us not beyond
our strength, for there is that clamoring and clawing
within, to whose voice we would not listen, yet shudder
lest we must, and it is red, Ah! God!   It is a red and
awful shape.
    Selah!
In yonder East trembles a star.
    Vengeance is mine; I will repay, saith the Lord!
Thy will, O Lord, be done!
    Kyrie Eleison!
Lord, we have done these pleading, wavering words.
    We beseech Thee to hear us, good Lord!
We bow our heads and hearken soft to the sobbing of
women and little children.
    We beseech Thee to hear us, good Lord!
Our voices sink in silence and in night.
    Hear us, good Lord!
In night, O God of a godless land!
    Amen!
In silence, O Silent God.
    Selah!"
At the Lindens Shiver in Autumn Dreams,"The fields lie wrapt in autumn dreams, 
   Beneath the dim, blue vault of night, 
     The moon, like a bark on sluggish streams, 
         Spreads soft her sail of silver light. 

Beneath the blue, dim vault of night, 
  With the way-worn notes of joy and care, 
     Across the sea of the moon's pale light
       Dark flocks of birds flap the silent air. 

With the way-worn notes of joy and care
   Fantastic shapes with wings outspread,
     Dark flocks of birds flap the silent air, 
       Like a cloud of ominous dread. 

Fantastic shapes with wings outspread, 
   Droning some harsh and ghoulish tune,
     Like a cloud of ominous dread, 
       They darken the sail of the white full moon. 

They darken the sail of the soft white moon, 
    Like pageants of some Valpurgis night, 
     Droning some harsh and ghoulish tune, 
       Their rustling wings are shimmering bright. 

Their rustling wings are shimmering bright
   As in myriad swarms they are passing by, 
      Like pageants of some Valpurgis night, 
        Wheeling their flight to some summer sky. 

Wheeling their flight whence summer has flown, 
    Like dreams and hopes long gone by, 
      Like songs of love our youth has known, 
        In myriad swarms they sail the sky. 

Like clouds a-sail on glassy streams—
    Grey memories of autumn dreams;—
       Like visions of love forever flown, 
         You, serial voyagers, wing your flight
             To some enchanted realm our youth has known, 
                 Beneath the dim, blue vault of night. "
Seawall soliloquy number two: she built a seawall,"My cousin 
had a nightmare 
that we kept 
building seawalls 
higher and 
higher 
all around 
our island 
up to 
the sky 
until suddenly 
we were 
at the bottom 
of a wishing well
looking 
up 
at the world."
Voyages V,"Meticulous, past midnight in clear rime,   
Infrangible and lonely, smooth as though cast   
Together in one merciless white blade—
The bay estuaries fleck the hard sky limits.
—As if too brittle or too clear to touch!   
The cables of our sleep so swiftly filed,
Already hang, shred ends from remembered stars.   
One frozen trackless smile... What words   
Can strangle this deaf moonlight? For we
Are overtaken. Now no cry, no sword   
Can fasten or deflect this tidal wedge,
Slow tyranny of moonlight, moonlight loved   
And changed... “There’s
Nothing like this in the world,” you say,   
Knowing I cannot touch your hand and look   
Too, into that godless cleft of sky
Where nothing turns but dead sands flashing.
“—And never to quite understand!” No,
In all the argosy of your bright hair I dreamed   
Nothing so flagless as this piracy.
                                               But now
Draw in your head, alone and too tall here.   
Your eyes already in the slant of drifting foam;   
Your breath sealed by the ghosts I do not know:   
Draw in your head and sleep the long way home."

Weekends are for my new love. Twice we trailed the periphery of the zoo to lunch beside the wolves for free.
Once we followed a deer trail to an abandoned barn. We used the corners of the corrugated wall as steps to dangle inward at the square opening.
We hardly breathed at two owls above the meeting of wood beams. I only saw their silent backs as they fled—our presences forcing them into midday light.

Rest House,"I see something moving

It is convincing me
that I am hungry

I am hungry
I have not eaten since 
I saw my mother intact
She was angry

her face
stress and strenuousness
warmth and forgiveness

When I rode the subway afterwards
I looked closely   maybe longingly
at the people around me

Hinemoana,"for Elizabeth, Sinead, Michelle, & Hinemoana
          Hinemoana reads poetry in the first       
     light of the morning where ducks study the   
 revolutionary texts of their shadows stretching
through the water like arteries         
the lake is as deep as the Empire State building is tall
     as dark as the Big Apple is
                        bright      
                  Hinemoana drags men
              into the still water      
                her hands shake in the traditional way           
                     leaving each body to be weighed down by bullion
                    soon the eels        begin to feast    black wires bulging        
                           Hinemoana buys an air fryer        to enjoy her catch              
                       she was always confused by the phrase             
                  friend not food           
             when obviously          they’re foes?    
      before going out Hinemoana makes a face mask
   out of the ashes of coral            
bits of her start to come away                            
           morsels tugging free of

                        now fully liquid she is ready to leave
                              her house beneath the sea             gone fishing

"To the ""Flat Iron""","On roof and street, on park and pier, 
The springtide sun shines soft and white, 
Where the “Flat Iron,” gaunt, austere, 
Lifts its huge tiers in limpid light. 

   From the city’s stir and madd’ning roar
   Your monstrous shape scars in massive flight, 
    And ’mid the breezes the ocean bore
    Your windows flame in the sunset light. 

        Lonely and lithe, o’er the nocturnal city’s 
        Flickering flames, you proudly tower, 
        Like some ancient, giant monolith, 
        Girt with the stars and mists that lower. 

All else we see fade fast and disappear, 
Only your prow-like form looms gaunt, austere, 
As in a sea of fog, now veiled, now clear. 

      Iron structure of the time, 
         Rich, in showing no pretense, 
           Fair, in frugalness sublime, 
        emblem staunch of common sense, 
            Well may you smile over Gotham’s vast domain, 
              As dawn greets your pillars with roseate flame, 
               For future ages will proclaim 
                      Your beauty, boldly, 
                              Without shame. "
The Gift of India,"Is there aught you need that my hands withhold,
Rich gifts of raiment or grain or gold?
Lo! I have flung to the East and West
Priceless treasures torn from my breast,
And yielded the sons of my stricken womb
To the drum-beats of duty, the sabres of doom.
Gathered like pearls in their alien graves
Silent they sleep by the Persian waves,
Scattered like shells on Egyptian sands,
They lie with pale brows and brave, broken hands,
They are strewn like blossoms mown down by chance
On the blood-brown meadows of Flanders and France.
Can ye measure the grief of the tears I weep
Or compass the woe of the watch I keep?
Or the pride that thrills thro’ my heart’s despair
And the hope that comforts the anguish of prayer?
And the far sad glorious vision I see
Of the torn red banners of Victory?
When the terror and tumult of hate shall cease
And life be refashioned on anvils of peace,
And your love shall offer memorial thanks
To the comrades who fought in your dauntless ranks,
And you honour the deeds of the deathless ones
Remember the blood of thy martyred sons!"
Dusk Song,"The garden is very quiet to-night,
The dusk has gone with the Evening Star,
And out on the bay a lone ship light
Makes a silver pathway over the bar
Where the sea sings low.
I follow the light with an earnest eye,
Creeping along to the thick far-away,
Until it fell in the depths of the deep, dark sky
With the haunting dream of the dusk of day
And its lovely glow.
Long nights, long nights and the whisperings of new ones,
Flame the line of the pathway down to the sea
With the halo of new dreams and the hallow of old ones,
And they bring magic light to my love reverie
And a lover’s regret.
Tender sorrow for loss of a soft murmured word,
Tender measure of doubt in a faint, aching heart,
Tender listening for wind-songs in the tree heights heard
When you and I were of the dusks a part,
Are with me yet.
I pray for faith to the noble spirit of Space,
I sound the cosmic depths for the measure of glory
Which will bring to this earth the imperishable race
Of whom Beauty dreamed in the soul-toned story
The Prophets told.
Silence and love and deep wonder of stars
Dust-silver the heavens from west to east,
From south to north, and in a maze of bars
Invisible I wander far from the feast,
As night grows old.
Half blind is my vision I know to the truth,
My ears are half deaf to the voice of the tear
That touches the silences as Autumn’s ruth
Steals through the dusks of each returning year,
A goodly friend.
The Autumn, then Winter and wintertime’s grief!
But the weight of the snow is the glistening gift
Which loving brings to the rose and its leaf,
For the days of the roses glow in the drift
And never end.
The moon has come.   Wan and pallid is she.
The spell of half memories, the touch of half tears,
And the wounds of worn passions she brings to me
With all the tremor of the far-off years
And their mad wrong.
Yet the garden is very quiet to-night,
The dusk has long gone with the Evening Star,
And out on the bay the moon’s wan light
Lays a silver pathway beyond the bar,
Dear heart, pale and long."
The Pirate,"I
Andante con grazia e molto maestoso.
The morning dawns, and shakes the stars
    From the raven locks of the queen of night,
        Some ripple down into the sea,
            Some drown in the morning light.
The morning dawns, and strange white forms
    O’er the silent waters stray,
        As if they were searching for falling stars,
            Whose gold has dripped astray,
                             Slipped away
              From the rose of morn
               To the shoreless waste,
                That, dull and grey, with its misty bars,
                  Yields no reflection to the death of stars.
The morning dawns, and the starting breeze,
   Rends the curtain of silence and mist
       Whence, tinged with roseate morn,
   The pirate’s galleon drifts—
                    Away from the shore,
        Where the watchfires gleam
           And the sea-gulls scream,
               To her daily toil
                    In quest of spoil
                       To waylay some wanderer of the sea.
With plumage strange and wings outspread,
   Like some huge bird from earth long fled,
      The highwayman of the main
                           Veers his way
To some blood-red day,
    Out of the silent, gray and shoreless night,
        As the stars ripple down into the sea
            Or drown in the morning light.
                        II
            Allegro con passione
The sea is white with the noonday glare,
    Save a dark unrest and reddish flare
        That troubles the seashine in the West.
There the fight is on—
    With yards entangled and sails aflame,
        Enveloped in clouds that darken the sky,
            Two dark hulls, lashed fast together,
                Motionless on the noonday waters lie.
                              The fight is on—
Amidst the clank of weapons, and powder scent,
    The rattle of muskets, wild shuffle of feet,
        Like the hissing groans of some soul accursed,  
            With lightning flares and fanlike bursts,
                Pass shot and shell.
The mouth of the cannons grow a grinning stare,
    With blood are daubed masts and spars,
        And the sparks blown to the lurid air
            Fall on the sails like a rain of stars.
                              The fight is on—
Black death with his wings of flame
    Now dominates this scene,
        This scene of black and red.
            Like a snake of fire in dismal desire
                He coils up the rigging, chars every plank
                    And gnaws his way towards the powder tank,
                        While lurid streams of red
                             Gush from the wounded and dead
                                  To the passionless flood,
                                       Stained with fire and blood.
The hours pass, and the crews are thinned,
    Both demand quarter—but none will strike,
        And still they fight—and fight—and fight—
            Till the blackened masts crash on the burning decks,
                Strewn with bodies in formless stacks.
                    The shrieks of the wounded die away,
                        Silence takes the place of carnage and fray,
                            And as a change to all things must come—
                                Even death ceases his fire-song.
Riddled from bow to stern with leaks on the gain
The hulls sink deeper into the passionless main,
Still lashed together as in the hours of fight,
   Like wounded beasts in wild despair,
        They suddenly leap into the lurid air,
                     Then roll to the side
              And glide from the day’s waning light
                         Down to the dismal night
                            Of the passionless flood,
                              Stained with fire and blood.
The sun swings from the hovering murk,
    Dark crows, that follow the pirate’s wake,
        Flap over crushed timbers and shivered beams,
           Adrift on the blood-stained flood like dismal dreams.
                            III
            Adagio non lamentoso
Thirty times the cannons roar
    Over the black and barren shore
                   Of the pirate isle,
    Under whose rifts of shifting sand
        Lies buried the gold, the pirate’s hand
           Wrest from the sea wanderer of many a land.
On the black banner that never was furled
    Lies dead the pride of the pirate’s race
       The crew shifts over the quarter deck
            Once more to gaze at his stern sea face.
                Then the anchor is hoisted!—
                   Drenched in the twilight’s gold
                       The ship shakes out every sail
                          And sweeps before the gale
                              Towards the highway of the deep,
                                 To put its hero forever to sleep.
What mean now thy hords of gold
    A-dream in the depth of the wind blown sand?
        What remains of thy sea face fantastic and bold
            When you have reached that coral strand,
                          Where the mermaids dwell,
                 Who love their pirate sweethearts well?
                            A last farewell to the sun and air,
                             To the twilight flare
                               With its pennant unfold
                                  Of crimson and gold!
                                    As strapped to the plank
                                      On the gangway you stand,
                                         To make the bold leap
                                           To the emerald deep.
Harsh as the winds over your life have blown,
  Your fate will be in the lands unknown
           Of the moonstone twilights of the sea
    And as its currents toss thee from shore to shore
        Through coral halls on the moss-grown floor,
          Moss grown since the days of yore,
                               You still will be, 
                                 Fearless and free,

Finale sotte voce e legato.
On emerald waves o’er which the moonbeams flow,
   Lost like a song on the winds that blow,
     An enchanted castle, a phantom sail—
               In silent flight from the rolling orb
                 Pursuing the wanderers of the night—
                   Strays with the wayward breeze
                     To be lost on the murmuring seas,
Like a ghost that rose from some emerald tomb
To haunt the murmuring main
And tell the tale of the pirate’s doom,
The end of the seaking’s reign.
From reddened wave and blackened shore
  The galleon has vanished forever more
    In the moonstone twilights of the sea;
     And only the music the seaweed brings
       Tells of the dauntless deeds of the dead seakings."

Igbo Landing: Afro Atlantan Merfolk,"disambiguation: Merpeople, Afro Atlantic, Sea Zombies
Salt-water creatures unliving in strip towns
along the Atlantic floor between Africa and Americas.
As when warrior goddess of the hurricane slapped
storms against thick planted cargo ship masts, moored,
sunk both strange and familiar men and still more came
As when god of disease sent rats to bite the soft beige
of shipmate cheeks, urinate on their food rations, release
fleas into matted slicks of oily hair and still more came
As when god of war descended incarnate and slit throats
into revolt, sometimes with no survivors on either side,
and still more came
As when god of disease blew foul air on sweaty faces
in the cargo hold, waited off portside for that shipment
to stagger to the deck, inhale a first chest-full of fresh air,
be lowered to the sea, delivered into the arms of god
of crossroads, and rushed back to healers on the continent
(instead, they were tossed stiff, breathless into the deep)
and still more came as when the Huntsfolk, guards of the surface
and the Merfolk, guards of the deep, stood watch over each
wind-tossed, diseased, starving, and revolting ship,
called to each piece of cargo by name, welcomed the leap overboard
souls to the waters, the portal to the next life."
"Sarah Page,","Who schooled you in the Incendiary Arts?
Trained you to wield helplessness?
You, 17, full of hip-switch and giggle
adrenaline-high with the judgment
of a matchbook.
Who taught you
the Craft of Damsel? How to snatch breath
from the air?
He grabbed
your arm, not knowing it was made of fire

It Was Not Fate,"It was not fate which overtook me,
Rather a wayward, wilful wind
That blew hot for awhile
And then, as the even shadows came, blew cold.
What pity it is that a man grown old in life’s dreaming
Should stop, e’en for a moment, to look into a woman’s eyes.
And I forgot!
Forgot that one’s heart must be steeled against the east wind.
Life and death alike come out of the East:
Life as tender as young grass,
Death as dreadful as the sight of clotted blood.
I shall go back into the darkness,
Not to dream but to seek the light again.
I shall go by paths, mayhap,
On roads that wind around the foothills
Where the plains are bare and wild
And the passers-by come few and far between.
I want the night to be long, the moon blind.
The hills thick with moving memories,
And my heart beating a breathless requiem
For all the dead days I have lived.
When the Dawn comes—Dawn, deathless, dreaming—
I shall will that my soul must be cleansed of hate,
I shall pray for strength to hold children close to my heart,
I shall desire to build houses where the poor will know
       shelter, comfort, beauty.
And then may I look into a woman’s eyes
And find holiness, love and the peace which passeth understanding."

The Only Place in the U.S. with Zero COVID Deaths,
The Weavers Were the First to Know,"The invasion came like a whisper,
and the leaves changed shapes, 
and the niyok grew sick.
Coconut trees,
our culture’s tree of life,
dying slowly 
as invasive beetles 
eat their hearts 
like world powers 
devour islands.
Weavers hold culture in their 
palms,
weave tradition into their families,
tuck young palms 
into their fingers,
mold them into 
entities.
But now,
our culture’s tree of life 
has grown ill from 
foreign settlement.
Palms severed,
bent like a salute
the way Chamorros are cut like cards
and dealt in front lines of American wars.
The weavers were the first to know
that our niyok is 
sick,
in need of healing.
The same way our island is 
sick,
in need of healing.
I’ve taken up the craft,
so I can weave
traditions
into the palms of my children.
I can only hope that when 
I master it,
palms will remain
for them
to weave into our future."
By Your Hand,"for Deon
I peer at the ridges of your palm
rested along the crevice of mine,
while tracing your jagged vasculature
with a delicate press of my finger,
and I explore every uneven wrinkle,
every pronounced callus, every rounded
mole like it is the hilly, stone-ridden
backyard of my childhood home in Mongmong.
I know this place. I have been here
before. I read the swirls inscribed
into your firm dark skin, sound out
each node and connecting branch,
sew syllables into words that spell
out gima’: home.
I raise your hand transposed against
the evening sky, clear of clouds, and I
can find the constellations within you.
Did you know our forefathers did this at sea—
placed their arm to the heavens to translate
the stars? Master navigators of the open ocean,
yet you, my love, are more than a map; I dare
not fold nor decipher your complexity. You
are the beloved, longed-for destination at the end
of the journey, the place that our ancestors craved
return, the reason for the expedition—refuge,
promise, hope. You are home."
The Viole(n)t Cat,"I hear you
Outside my winter studio
Moaning in the alley below my bedroom window
Calling for god the machine of all magics
All spells written on our bodies
All the right incense of rank summer
The flowers breaking through the confusion
You speak for all of us
By that I mean me
You speak for me myself and I
This morning tomorrow’s and
My midnight always now, moan for me
I moan full bridge
Field of lavender
The bridge to Olosega
White sand road and men’s voices
Beneath the road flows the sea between two islands
Lavender stream
The spirits of the sea
My lovers"
"Imaginary Photo Album or, When We Die, Our Polaroids Speak to Our Living Descendants","To Keep
the memories nimble, place your fingers inside the mouth of her hair.
The history there is one motion, told and retold by millions of bodies 
over hundreds of years. Sister, mother, grandmother, aunt, cousin, 
lover, friend, partner, braid me. Keep the tales of what we cannot forget here.
  To Float
think of silted braided rivers. Now extricate the rivulets. Use your tongue.
Can you discern salt from iron or shell from shale? This is what it is like
to make a world with words. 
  To Re-grow
a tongue, pull it from beneath silt at the bottom of the sea. 
If it is knotted, frayed, tangled, you can take up my voice. Look for my
feathers in dust, find my matted feathers in the surf. There, make
a nest for me. Gather shells and driftwood. Dig a small bowl
in the sand. Let the patterns arrange themselves into a beautiful thing.
Ask me to come, and you will find me on the horizon, glittering.
  To Claim
you we claimed ourselves. We touched the surfaces of mirrors
with no reflections. Hic sunt leones. Here there are lions. Here are waves.
Imagine us a tide of lions crashing on sandy shores, returning for what is ours.
  To Unfold
into a receptacle for holding joy, entrust your tender heart to another.
Look. We are more than our scars. We hold the memory of trauma
in our roots. And still, here is a moment of pure joy. See how our chests
shake the air with a trust manifested from generations of resilience? 
Reach for each other. Embrace. Grow flowers with your lungs."
A Road for Loss,"translated from the Arabic by Fady Joudah
Like the rest of you,
I thought of escape.
But I have a fear of flying,
a phobia of congested bridges
and traffic accidents,
of learning a new language.
My plan’s for a simple getaway,
a small departure:
pack my children in a suitcase
and to a new place we go.
Directions confuse me:
there’s no forest in this city,
no desert either.
Do you know a road for loss
that doesn’t end
in a settlement?
I thought of befriending animals,
the adorable type, as substitutes
for my children’s electronic toys,
but I want a place for getting lost.
My children will grow,
their questions will multiply,
and I don’t tell lies,
but teachers distort my words.
I don’t hold grudges,
but neighbors are always nosy.
I don’t rebuke,
but enemies kill.
My children grow older,
and no one’s thought yet
to broadcast the final news hour,
shut down religious channels,
seal school roofs and walls,
end torture.
I don’t dare to speak.
Whatever I speak of happens.
I don’t want to speak.
I’d rather be lost."
Mothers Arrange Their Aches at Night,"Translated by Fady Joudah
Joint pain, high sugar,
rheumatic ailments,
a boy who missed school because of a cold:
mothers feel sadness for mysterious reasons,
like sadness over other mothers
who stand in public streets
holding photos of their sons’
well-groomed faces
with sideburns and mustaches,
waiting for the cameras to capture them
and their chapped hands.
Mothers who hold up the house beams,
open windows,
air out carpets on roofs,
expel moths from the hearts
of abandoned mattresses
in case a visitor arrives.
Mothers, who stipulate
no conditions for return,
arrange their aches at night
and wash their daughters’ hair with oil,
in bed they toss and turn.
And when they fall asleep
they snore
and give the house a name and a voice."
You Can’t,"Translated by Fady Joudah
They will fall in the end, 
those who say you can’t. 
It’ll be age or boredom that overtakes them, 
or lack of imagination. 
Sooner or later, all leaves fall to the ground. 
You can be the last leaf. 
You can convince the universe 
that you pose no threat 
to the tree’s life. "
Some Microbes,"Translated by Fady Joudah
Some microbes 
liberate themselves 
from the body they’ve settled in
by suicide.
They whisper in your ear
to smash your car into a wall
or blow up a pier.
Even madness, 
our singular claim to superiority,
is nothing more than a vitamin deficiency. 
All this and you still doubt
how pink
my nipples are
after I’ve told you they’re pink.
Microbes whisper Vitamin D
to me, whisper amino acids,
yellow plasma, and a man
that morphine takes away 
as oxygen grabs him by his arm.
I touch myself to live free
of arterial disease and gastric ailments.
I counter microbes
with supplements 
that give me headaches
and good standing in a middle class
that guards itself against a painful death.
I used to fear going hungry 
in the cold
of forgetting.
Now I fear microbes with voices."
The Ascent,"Into the air like dandelion seed
Or like the spiral of lark into the light
Or fountain into sun. All former sight
From hill or mountain was a mere hint of this.
We gain a new dimension. What had been
Our prison, where we crawled and clung like ants,
We spurn, and vision lying far beneath us.
O naked shape of earth! What green mammelles,
Arteries of gold and silver, turquoise flanks,
Plush jungles now are patterned! As we bank,
The earth tilts; we are level and aloof,
And it spins on and on among the stars.
We poise in air, hang motionless, and see
The planet turns with slow grace of a dancer."
Memorial Wreath,"(It is a little-known fact that 200,000 Negroes fought
for freedom in the Union Army during the Civil War.)
In this green month when resurrected flowers,
Like laughing children ignorant of death,
Brighten the couch of those who wake no more,
Love and remembrance blossom in our hearts
For you who bore the extreme sharp pang for us,
And bought our freedom with your lives.
                                                           And now,
Honoring your memory, with love we bring
These fiery roses, white-hot cotton flowers
And violets bluer than cool northern skies
You dreamed of stooped in burning prison fields
When liberty was only a faint north star,
Not a bright flower planted by your hands
Reaching up hardy nourished with your blood.
Fit gravefellows you are for Douglass, Brown,
Turner and Truth and Tubman . . . whose rapt eyes
Fashioned a new world in this wilderness.
American earth is richer for your bones:
Our hearts beat prouder for the blood we inherit."
Booker T. And W.E.B.,"“It seems to me,” said Booker T.,
“It shows a mighty lot of cheek
To study chemistry and Greek
When Mister Charlie needs a hand
To hoe the cotton on his land,
And when Miss Ann looks for a cook,
Why stick your nose inside a book?”
“I don’t agree,” said W. E. B.,
“If I should have the drive to seek
Knowledge of chemistry or Greek,
I’ll do it. Charles and Miss can look
Another place for hand or cook.
Some men rejoice in skill of hand,
And some in cultivating land,
But there are others who maintain
The right to cultivate the brain.”
“It seems to me,” said Booker T.,
“That all you folks have missed the boat
Who shout about the right to vote,
And spend vain days and sleepless nights
In uproar over civil rights.
Just keep your mouths shut, do not grouse,
But work, and save, and buy a house.”
“I don’t agree,” said W. E. B.,
“For what can property avail
If dignity and justice fail?
Unless you help to make the laws,
They’ll steal your house with trumped-up clause.
A rope’s as tight, a fire as hot,
No matter how much cash you’ve got.
Speak soft, and try your little plan,
But as for me, I’ll be a man.”
“It seems to me,” said Booker T.—

“I don’t agree,”
Said W. E. B."
An Indignation Dinner,"Dey was hard times jes fo’ Christmas round our neighborhood one year;
So we held a secret meetin’, whah de white folks couldn’t hear,
To ’scuss de situation, an’ to see what could be done
Towa’d a fust-class Christmas dinneh an’ a little Christmas fun.
Rufus Green, who called de meetin’, ris an’ said: “In dis here town,
An’ throughout de land, de white folks is a-tryin’ to keep us down.”
S’ ’e: “Dey bought us, sold us, beat us; now dey ’buse us ’ca’se we’s free;
But when dey tetch my stomach, dey’s done gone too fur foh me!
“Is I right?”   “You sho is, Rufus!” roared a dozen hungry throats.
“Ef you’d keep a mule a-wo’kin’, don’t you tamper wid his oats.
“Dat’s sense,” continued Rufus. “But dese white folks nowadays
Has done got so close and stingy you can’t live on what dey pays.
“Here ’tis Christmas-time, an’, folkses, I’s indignant ’nough to choke.
Whah’s our Christmas dinneh comin’ when we’s ’mos’ completely broke?
I can’t hahdly ’fo’d a toothpick an’ a glass o’ water. Mad?
Say, I’m desp’ret! Dey jes better treat me nice, dese white folks had!”
Well, dey ’bused de white folks scan’lous, till old Pappy Simmons ris,
Leanin’ on his cane to s’pote him, on account his rheumatis’,
An’ s’ ’e: “Chilun, whut’s dat wintry wind a-sighin’ th’ough de street
’Bout yo’ wasted summeh wages?   But, no matter, we mus’ eat.
“Now, I seed a beau’ful tuhkey on a certain gemmun’s fahm.
He’s a-growin’ fat an’ sassy, an’ a-struttin’ to a chahm.
Chickens, sheeps, hogs, sweet pertaters—all de craps is fine dis year;
All we needs is a committee foh to tote de goodies here.”
Well, we lit right in an’ voted dat it was a gran’ idee,
An’ de dinneh we had Christmas was worth trabblin’ miles to see;
An’ we eat a full an’ plenty, big an’ little, great an’ small,
Not beca’se we was dishonest, but indignant, sah. Dat’s all."
To Any Reader,"As from the house your mother sees
You playing round the garden trees,
So you may see, if you will look
Through the windows of this book,
Another child, far, far away,
And in another garden, play.
But do not think you can at all,
By knocking on the window, call
That child to hear you. He intent
Is all on his play-business bent.
He does not hear; he will not look,
Nor yet be lured out of this book.
For, long ago, the truth to say,
He has grown up and gone away,
And it is but a child of air
That lingers in the garden there."
Ahead and Around,"Ahead and Around
Met, quarreled, quilled the bird of peace,
Untidied a pleasant plane.
Ahead accused Around of complete deceit,
Around accused Ahead of being discontented.
Neither listened to each.
Either lined on,
Making round straight and straight round,
Permitting nothing in-between,
Licked space clean,
Fattened unhappily and flew
Along the geometrical faith of two-and-two,
Hated apart; and far and far
Each wanderer
Hoped toward a spiritually reconnoitered heaven.
“For,” cried sinuous Around,
“More and less than I, am I,
Nature of all things, all things the nature of me.”
Ahead echoed the cry.
Sped toward its own eternity
Of the sweet end before the bitter beyond, beyond.
And both were brave and both were strong,
And the ways of both were like and long,
And adventured freely in fettered song:
One that circled as it sang,
One that longitudinally rang.
The spite prospered. The spite stopped.
Both earned the same end differently,
Prided along two different paths,
Reached the same humility
Of an old-trodden start.
Birth is the beginning where all part.
Death is the beginning where they meet."
In The Matter Of Two Men,"One does such work as one will not,
    And well each knows the right;
Though the white storm howls, or the sun is hot,
    The black must serve the white.
And it’s, oh, for the white man’s softening flesh,
    While the black man’s muscles grow!
Well I know which grows the mightier,
    I know; full well I know.
The white man seeks the soft, fat place,
    And he moves and he works by rule.
Ingenious grows the humbler race
    In Oppression’s prodding school.
And it’s, oh, for a white man gone to seed,
    While the Negro struggles so!
And I know which race develops most,
    I know; yes, well I know.
The white man rides in a palace car,
    And the Negro rides “Jim Crow”
To damn the other with bolt and bar,
    One creepeth so low; so low!
And it’s, oh, for a master’s nose in the mire,
    While the humbled hearts o’erflow!
Well I know whose soul grows big at this,
    And whose grows small; I know!
The white man leases out his land,
    And the Negro tills the same.
One works; one loafs and takes command;
    But I know who wins the game!
And it’s, oh, for the white man’s shrinking soil.
    As the black’s rich acres grow!
Well I know how the signs point out at last,
    I know; ah, well I know!
The white man votes for his color’s sake.
    While the black, for his is barred;
(Though “ignorance” is the charge they make),
    But the black man studies hard.
And it’s, oh, for the white man’s sad neglect,
    For the power of his light let go!
So, I know which man must win at last,
    I know! Ah, Friend, I know!"
The Road To The Bow,"Ever and ever anon,
    After the black storm, the eternal, beauteous bow!
Brother, to rosy-painted mists that arch beyond,
    Blithely I go.
My brows men laureled and my lyre
    Twined with immortal ivy for one little rippling song;
My “House of Golden Leaves” they praised and “passionate fire”—
    But, Friend, the way is long!
Onward and onward, up! away!
    Though Fear flaunt all his banners in my face,
And my feet stumble, lo! the Orphean Day!
    Forward by God’s grace!
These signs are still before me: “Fear,”
    “Danger,” “Unprecedented,” and I hear black “No”
Still thundering, and “Churl.” Good Friend, I rest me here—
    Then to the glittering bow!
Loometh and cometh Hate in wrath,
    Mailed Wrong, swart Servitude and Shame with bitter rue,
Nathless a Negro poet’s feet must tread the path
    The winged god knew.
Thus, my true Brother, dream-led, I
    Forfend the anathema, following the span.
I hold my head as proudly high
    As any man."
Laughter in the Slums,"In crippled streets where happiness seems buried
under the sooty snow of northern winter,
sudden as bells at twilight,
bright as the moon, full as the sun, there blossoms
in southern throats rich flower of flush fields
hot with the furnace sun of Georgia Junes,
laughter that cold and blizzards could not kill."
Ballad of Birmingham,"         (On the bombing of a church in Birmingham, Alabama, 1963)
“Mother dear, may I go downtown
Instead of out to play,
And march the streets of Birmingham
In a Freedom March today?”
“No, baby, no, you may not go,
For the dogs are fierce and wild,
And clubs and hoses, guns and jails
Aren’t good for a little child.”
“But, mother, I won’t be alone.
Other children will go with me,
And march the streets of Birmingham
To make our country free.”
“No, baby, no, you may not go,
For I fear those guns will fire.
But you may go to church instead
And sing in the children’s choir.”
She has combed and brushed her night-dark hair,
And bathed rose petal sweet,
And drawn white gloves on her small brown hands,
And white shoes on her feet.
The mother smiled to know her child
Was in the sacred place,
But that smile was the last smile
To come upon her face.
For when she heard the explosion,
Her eyes grew wet and wild.
She raced through the streets of Birmingham
Calling for her child.
She clawed through bits of glass and brick,
Then lifted out a shoe.
“O, here’s the shoe my baby wore,
But, baby, where are you?”"
The Negro Singer,"O’er all my song the image of a face
    Lieth, like shadow on the wild sweet flowers.
    The dream, the ecstasy that prompts my powers;
    The golden lyre’s delights bring little grace
To bless the singer of a lowly race.
    Long hath this mocked me: aye in marvelous hours,
    When Hera’s gardens gleamed, or Cynthia’s bowers,
    Or Hope’s red pylons, in their far, hushed place!
But I shall dig me deeper to the gold;
    Fetch water, dripping, over desert miles.
    From clear Nyanzas and mysterious Niles
Of love; and sing, nor one kind act withhold.
    So shall men know me, and remember long,
    Nor my dark face dishonor any song."
Paul Laurence Dunbar,"He came, a youth, singing in the dawn
    Of a new freedom, glowing o’er his lyre.
    Refining, as with great Apollo’s fire,
    His people’s gift of song.   And thereupon,
This Negro singer, come to Helicon,
    Constrained the masters, listening to admire,
    And roused a race to wonder and aspire,
    Gazing which way their honest voice was gone,
With ebon face uplit of glory’s crest.
    Men marveled at the singer, strong and sweet,
    Who brought the cabin’s mirth, the tuneful night,
But faced the morning, beautiful with light,
    To die while shadows yet fell toward the west,
    And leave his laurels at his people’s feet.
Dunbar, no poet wears your laurels now;
    None rises, singing, from your race like you.
    Dark melodist, immortal, though the dew
    Fell early on the bays upon your brow,
And tinged with pathos every halcyon vow
    And brave endeavor.   Silence o’er you threw
    Flowerets of love.   Or, if an envious few
    Of your own people brought no garlands, how
Could malice smite him whom the gods had crowned?
    If, like the meadow-lark, your flight was low,
    Your flooded lyrics half the hilltops drowned;
A wide world heard you, and it loved you so,
    It stilled its heart to list the strains you sang.
    And o’er your happy songs its plaudits rang."
Compensation,"O, rich young lord, thou ridest by
With looks of high disdain;
It chafes me not thy title high,
Thy blood of oldest strain.
The lady riding at thy side
Is but in name thy promised bride.
       Ride on, young lord, ride on!
Her father wills and she obeys,
The custom of her class;
’Tis Land not Love the trothing sways—
For Land he sells his lass.
Her fair white hand, young lord, is thine,
Her soul, proud fool, her soul is mine,
       Ride on, young lord, ride on!
No title high my father bore;
The tenant of thy farm,
He left me what I value more:
Clean heart, clear brain, strong arm
And love for bird and beast and bee
And song of lark and hymn of sea,
       Ride on, young lord, ride on!
The boundless sky to me belongs,
The paltry acres thine;
The painted beauty sings thy songs,
The lavrock lilts me mine;
The hot-housed orchid blooms for thee,
The gorse and heather bloom for me,
       Ride on, young lord, ride on!"
Lebanus,"To B.C.R
   O my Love, how long wilt thou continue
      Fondly nursing every dreaming Hour!
   Our Lebanus, O my Love, is calling,
      Yea, and waiting in his ancient Tower.
In his ancient, cedar-shaded castle,
Night and day, Lebanus sits a-musing
Of the memories that bloom unnoticed
Every season at the feet of Sorrow;—
Musing of the radiant days of Tammuz
That went dancing with the bride of summer
Down the deep and pine-encircled Wadi;—
Musing of the time the Prophets kindled
Sacred fire in Man's empurpled temples,
Blazing all the highways of the world;—
Musing of the days embattled monarchs
Laid their shields and lances at his feet,
Bowed before his throne invincible.
O my Love, the sad and lonely Cedar,
Ever rocking in her arid splendor,
Ever in penurious shades embosomed,
Reaches out for water in the meadows
And for sunlight in deserted vineyards;—
Rears her hope above the snow eternal
Crowning her Time-hallowed desolation.
O my Love, the crumbling Temple's dreaming
Of the star that wanders from its orbit,
Of the rose that blooms and dies forsaken,
Of the leaves that fall from sheltering branches
Only to become the sport of chance winds
Or the bed of some unsightly creeper;—
Dreaming of the Lebanon lily, drooping
In the dells beneath forbidding ridges;—
Dreaming of the corymbs of the elder
That forgot the touch of loving hands,
For the zephyr of the South, which passes
O'er their bloom of tender welcome, only
Fans into a flame the smoldering embers
Of the anguish of departed lovers.
O my Love, the furzes are in full bloom
Waiting on the terrace of Lebanus
For the ardent and enamored seeker,—
Waiting, and the secret of their silence
Locked remains within their shells of amber
Till thou comest, till they hear thee whisper,
I am thine and thou art mine forever.
O my Love, how long wilt hither tarry,
      Making toys of Time's discarded hours?
Fair Lebanus, O my Love, is calling,
      Yea, and waiting in his House of Flowers.
And around it wings of song unnumbered,
Amber-tinted, beryline, vermilion,
Pour their riches in the land of mourning,
Strew their silver in the olive grove,
Weave their magic through the almond blossoms,
Shake the incense from the terebinths,
Spread in vain their gladness o'er the pines.
Yea, a sea of Siren witchery,
Like the sundown inundates the heaven,
Rolling o'er a sea of boughs emblossomed,
Multi-hued, aglow with burning rapture;—
Waves of song are on the scented breezes,
Rolling o'er the virgin snow of Sanneen,
O'er the trackless verdure of the lowland,
O'er the mottled mountains joined forever
In a wild embrace of stony silence;—
Rolling over Wadis fondly nursing
Cyclamens of unremembered seasons,
Oleanders of unfathered beauty,
Irises of mothered tenderness.
Yea, my Love, the robin in the olives
Thrills the very shadows of the branch;
In the pomegranate, thrush and skylark
Fills its crimson cups with flaming rapture;
In the fig tree and the laden vineyard,
Bulbuls chant the joy of harvest-time.
Yea, my Love, the birds of dawn are calling,
Whispering, chattering, warbling everywhere,
Dancing, flitting, waiting in the groves,
Lingering in the chinks of terraces,
Making early visits to their young.
Nay, they're busy making preparation
For thy coming, longing to behold thee,
Signing meanwhile to the morning star,
Which borrows from thine eyes its radiance,
From thy tresses, all its golden splendor.
   O my Love, how long wilt hither tarry,
      Wilt dally with the web of Time, how long?
   Lone Lebanus, O my Love, is calling,
      Yea, and waiting in his House of Song.
And over it our star is re-appearing!
The star of our own destiny is rising
O'er the mountains of embrace eternal,
O'er the cedars of the sacred faith,
O'er the ruins of the ancient temple,
Flooding them with light of tender pallor
Like the light that lingers in the eyes
Of parted lovers,—shaking from the bosom
Of night their shadows, dew-drenched, iris-scented,—
Garlanding the messengers of morning
For the coming of the well-loved stranger.
Yea, the Star of Love, the Light supernal,
Before which bowed the world in adoration,
Is re-appearing in the Orient heaven
For thy sake, for thee, O my Belovéd.
Yea, without thee, neither song nor flower
Nor star nor temple of antique Lebanus,
Has aught compelling of the Soul's devotion.
But with thee, the caves, the naked ridges,
The very rocks betoken the divine.
   O my Love, how long wilt hither tarry
      Weaving gossamer of day and night?
   Sad Lebanus, O my Love, is calling,
      Yea, and waiting in his House of Light."
The Wanderer,"I wander among the hills of alien lands
   Where Nature her prerogative resigns
To Man; where Comfort in her shack reclines
   And all the arts and sciences commands.
      But in my soul
      The eastern billows roll—
I hear the voices of my native strands.
My lingering eyes, a lonely hemlock fills
   With grace and splendor rising manifold;
Beneath her boughs the maples spread their gold
   And at her feet, the silver of rills.
      But in my heart
      A peasant void of art
Echoes the voices of my native hills.
On every height a studied art confines
   All human joy in social pulchritude;
The boxwood frowns where beckoning birches stood,
   And where the thrushes caroled Fashion dines.
      But through the spreading cheer
      The shepherd's reed I hear
Beneath my Lebanon terebinths and pines.
And though no voices here are heard of toil,
   Nor accents least of sorrow, nor the din
Of multitudes, nor even at the Inn
   The City is permitted aught to spoil,
      Yet in my breast,
       A shack at best,
Laments the mother of my native soil.
Even where the sumptuous solitudes deny
   A shelter to a bird or butterfly,
As in the humblest dwelling of the dale
   A gracious welcome's shown the passer-by;
       But evermore clear
       Allwhere I hear
The calling of my native hut and sky.
Land of my birth! a handful of thy sod
   Resuscitates the flower of my faith;
For whatsoever the seer of science sayth,
   Thou art the cradle and the tomb of God;
      And forever I behold
      A vision old
Of Beauty weeping where He once hath trod."
After Reading King Lear,"Is ’t strange that in the cycle of his woes,
   Which shakes his cloud-embosomed peak of years
   And shatters the very fountain of his tears,
He seeks the friendly path of winds and snows?
When Villainy forgiven more villainous grows,
   And Treason in his robes herself attires,
   And Love beneath Adultery’s sheet expires,
Is ’t strange that mating with the Storm he goes?
Father and King! in sooth, they know thee well—
   The Whirlwind and the Forest and the Night;
But we who in the obscure shelters dwell
   Know better of thy sorrow than thy might.
Father and King! thy heritage is vast;
Wherever children be, its seeds are cast."
The House of Night,"Her sable robes the gloaming trails
   From golden strand to purple height,
And softly, over the welds and dales,
   Into the vacant House of Night.
But lo, where first her footsteps mark
   The sunset's last extinguished pyre,—
Above the hills,—a saffron spark,
   A gleam of unconjectured fire.
Between the foliaged zone and sky,
   Where sentries of the forest stand,
It peeps and flits—a firefly;
   It soars and glows—a firebrand.
A sacred flame from hemlock shades,
   Rising like a mystic sign
Above the silence of the glades
   Into the solitudes divine.
A sign perchance from those who pass
   To those who follow in the gloom,
Dancing round a moulten mass
   Above the grudging gulfs of doom.
A new-born world, though years untold
   Have fed the forge that gave it breath,
Where life still casts of beaten gold
   Cressets for the shrine of Death.
A dying world, though like a gem
   Of sapphire hues in nacre bright,
Drop from the zone or diadem
   Of the immortal queen of night.
A world! From depths to heights as dark
   It leaps anon into the dance
And whirls away—’t is but a spark
   From the anvil of the God of Chance,
But Faith and Fancy often mar
   The mystery of things divine;
For that which is a rolling star
   Was fluttering neath a lonely pine.
And lo, another orb doth roll
   Above the groves where once it trod;
And still another seeks its goal
   In the infinities of God.
From where the eagle marks his flight,
   Across the void that earth-bound seems,
They twinkle forth, a circle of light,
   Around the Gloaming's couch of dreams.
And thus they first themselves disguise
   As glow worms in the gathering gloom,
And suddenly refulgent rise
   O'er the abysmal tracks of doom.
For aeons thus, from hill to sea,
   Athwart the grudging gulfs they glow;
And waning tell of the worlds that be
   And the ghosts of worlds of long ago.
For aeons thus, their torches high,
   The gods unseen—as when the light
Of day conceals the starry sky—
   Illuminate the House of Night."

A Poem for My Wife,"I’m in my room writing
speaking in myself
& I hear you
move down the hallway
to water your plants
I write truth on the page
I strike the word over & over
yet I worry you’ll pour too much water on the plants
& the water will overflow onto the books
ruining them
If I can’t speak out of myself
how can I tell you I don’t care about the plants?
how can I tell you I don’t care if the books get wet?
We’ve been together seven years
& only now do I begin
clearing my throat to speak to you."

the chandelier in the sky sparkles
until we four cross diagonally 
over rows 44, 43, 9, and 7
and are watched by a pagan

That lady quiet in a blue shrine
with beads, plastic flowers
and a battery-operated candle
a spider stitching her cheek
transmitting a lullaby plainsong

When the Frost is on the Punkin,"When the frost is on the punkin and the fodder’s in the shock,
And you hear the kyouck and gobble of the struttin’ turkey-cock,
And the clackin’ of the guineys, and the cluckin’ of the hens,
And the rooster’s hallylooyer as he tiptoes on the fence;
O, it’s then’s the times a feller is a-feelin’ at his best,
With the risin’ sun to greet him from a night of peaceful rest,
As he leaves the house, bareheaded, and goes out to feed the stock,
When the frost is on the punkin and the fodder’s in the shock.
They’s something kindo’ harty-like about the atmusfere
When the heat of summer’s over and the coolin’ fall is here—
Of course we miss the flowers, and the blossums on the trees,
And the mumble of the hummin’-birds and buzzin’ of the bees;
But the air’s so appetizin’; and the landscape through the haze
Of a crisp and sunny morning of the airly autumn days
Is a pictur’ that no painter has the colorin’ to mock—
When the frost is on the punkin and the fodder’s in the shock.
The husky, rusty russel of the tossels of the corn,
And the raspin’ of the tangled leaves, as golden as the morn;
The stubble in the furries—kindo’ lonesome-like, but still
A-preachin’ sermuns to us of the barns they growed to fill;
The strawstack in the medder, and the reaper in the shed;
The hosses in theyr stalls below—the clover over-head!—
O, it sets my hart a-clickin’ like the tickin’ of a clock,
When the frost is on the punkin and the fodder’s in the shock!
Then your apples all is gethered, and the ones a feller keeps
Is poured around the celler-floor in red and yeller heaps;
And your cider-makin’ ’s over, and your wimmern-folks is through
With their mince and apple-butter, and theyr souse and saussage, too!...
I don’t know how to tell it—but ef sich a thing could be
As the Angels wantin’ boardin’, and they’d call around on me—
I’d want to ’commodate ’em—all the whole-indurin’ flock—
When the frost is on the punkin and the fodder’s in the shock!"
O Freedom,"O Freedom, in thy cause I fought, 
   For twenty years I fought in vain; 
And in my mountain shelter naught
   But worthless trophies now remain. 
Yet in my heart I hear a cry, 
   Which never there makes a vain appeal:
I would once more beneath thy sky
   Brandish my sharp and shining steel. 

How much one stakes upon thy dream, 
   How much for but thy name we pay; 
How cheap the passing ages seem, 
   When years are given for thy day. 
How many still would fight and die
   In thine old cause and for thy weal! 
I would once more beneath thy sky
   Brandish my sharp and shining steel. 

The purest love I give away, 
   The bliss of it I set at naught; 
Again I'm on my wayward way 
   Seeking what I have often sought. 
My wounded hopes, my bleeding ties, 
   No peace inglorious e’er shall heal: 
I would once more beneath thy skies 
   Brandish my sharp and shining steel. 

O Freedom, though thy price be high, 
   Though one for thee his life must seal, 
I would once more beneath thy sky
  Brandish my sharp and shining steel. "
Wet-weather Talk,"It hain’t no use to grumble and complane;
It’s jest as cheap and easy to rejoice.—
When God sorts out the weather and sends rain,
W’y rain’s my choice.
Men ginerly, to all intents—
Although they’re apt to grumble some—
Puts most theyr trust in Providence,
And takes things as they come—
That is, the commonality
Of men that’s lived as long as me
Has watched the world enugh to learn
They’re not the boss of this concern.
With some, of course, it’s different—
I’ve saw young men that knowed it all,
And didn’t like the way things went
On this terrestchul ball;—
But all the same, the rain, some way,
Rained jest as hard on picnic day;
Er, when they railly wanted it,
It mayby wouldn’t rain a bit!
In this existunce, dry and wet
Will overtake the best of men—
Some little skift o’ clouds’ll shet
The sun off now and then.—
And mayby, whilse you’re wundern who
You’ve fool-like lent your umbrell’ to,
And want it—out’ll pop the sun,
And you’ll be glad you hain’t got none!
It aggervates the farmers, too—
They’s too much wet, er too much sun,
Er work, er waitin’ round to do
Before the plowin’ ’s done:
And mayby, like as not, the wheat,
Jest as it’s lookin’ hard to beat,
Will ketch the storm—and jest about
The time the corn’s a-jintin’ out.
These-here cy-clones a-foolin’ round—
And back’ard crops!—and wind and rain!—
And yit the corn that’s wallerd down
May elbow up again!—
They hain’t no sense, as I can see,
Fer mortuls, sech as us, to be
A-faultin’ Natchur’s wise intents,
And lockin’ horns with Providence!
It hain’t no use to grumble and complane;
It’s jest as cheap and easy to rejoice.—
When God sorts out the weather and sends rain,
W’y, rain’ my choice."

Wuz parchin’ corn fer The Raggedy Man!
Better say,
“Clear out o’ the way!
They’s time fer work, an’ time fer play!
Take the hint, an’ run, child, run!
Er we cain’t git no courtin’ done!”"
The Old Swimmin' Hole,"Oh! the old swimmin’-hole! whare the crick so still and deep
Looked like a baby-river that was laying half asleep,
And the gurgle of the worter round the drift jest below
Sounded like the laugh of something we onc’t ust to know
Before we could remember anything but the eyes
Of the angels lookin’ out as we left Paradise;
But the merry days of youth is beyond our controle,
And it’s hard to part ferever with the old swimmin’-hole.
Oh! the old swimmin’-hole! In the happy days of yore,
When I ust to lean above it on the old sickamore,
Oh! it showed me a face in its warm sunny tide
That gazed back at me so gay and glorified,
It made me love myself, as I leaped to caress
My shadder smilin’ up at me with sich tenderness.
But them days is past and gone, and old Time’s tuck his toll
From the old man come back to the old swimmin’-hole.
Oh! the old swimmin’-hole! In the long, lazy days
When the humdrum of school made so many run-a-ways,
How plesant was the jurney down the old dusty lane,
Whare the tracks of our bare feet was all printed so plane
You could tell by the dent of the heel and the sole
They was lots o’ fun on hands at the old swimmin’-hole.
But the lost joys is past! Let your tears in sorrow roll
Like the rain that ust to dapple up the old swimmin’ hole.
Thare the bullrushes growed, and the cattails so tall,
And the sunshine and shadder fell over it all;
And it mottled the worter with amber and gold
Tel the glad lilies rocked in the ripples that rolled;
And the snake-feeder’s four gauzy wings fluttered by
Like the ghost of a daisy dropped out of the sky,
Or a wownded apple-blossom in the breeze’s controle
As it cut acrost some orchard to’rds the old swimmin’-hole.
Oh! the old swimmin’-hole! When I last saw the place,
The scenes was all changed, like the change in my face;
The bridge of the railroad now crosses the spot
Whare the old divin’-log lays sunk and fergot.
And I stray down the banks whare the trees ust to be—
But never again will theyr shade shelter me!
And I wish in my sorrow I could strip to the soul,
And dive off in my grave like the old swimmin’-hole."
Granny,"Granny’s come to our house,
    And ho! my lawzy-daisy!
All the childern round the place
    Is ist a-runnin’ crazy!
Fetched a cake fer little Jake,
    And fetched a pie fer Nanny,
And fetched a pear fer all the pack
    That runs to kiss their Granny!
Lucy Ellen’s in her lap,
    And Wade and Silas Walker
Both’s a-ridin’ on her foot,
    And ’Pollos on the rocker;
And Marthy’s twins, from Aunt Marinn’s,
    And little Orphant Annie,
All’s a-eatin’ gingerbread
    And giggle-un at Granny!
Tells us all the fairy tales
    Ever thought er wundered—
And ’bundance o’ other stories—
    Bet she knows a hunderd!—
Bob’s the one fer “Whittington,”
    And “Golden Locks” fer Fanny!
Hear ’em laugh and clap their hands,
    Listenin’ at Granny!
“Jack the Giant-Killer” ’s good;
    And “Bean-Stalk” ’s another!—
So’s the one of “Cinderell’”
    And her old godmother;—
That-un’s best of all the rest—
    Bestest one of any,—
Where the mices scampers home
    Like we runs to Granny!
Granny’s come to our house,
    Ho! my lawzy-daisy!
All the childern round the place
    Is ist a-runnin’ crazy!
Fetched a cake fer little Jake,
    And fetched a pie fer Nanny,
And fetched a pear fer all the pack
    That runs to kiss their Granny!"
The Bumblebee,"You better not fool with a Bumblebee!—
Ef you don’t think they can sting—you’ll see!
They’re lazy to look at, an’ kind o’ go
Buzzin’ an’ bummin’ aroun’ so slow,
An’ ac’ so slouchy an’ all fagged out,
Danglin’ their legs as they drone about
The hollyhawks ’at they can’t climb in
’Ithout ist a-tumble-un out ag’in!
Wunst I watched one climb clean ’way
In a jimson-blossom, I did, one day,—
An’ I ist grabbed it — an’ nen let go—
An’ “Ooh-ooh! Honey! I told ye so!”
Says The Raggedy Man; an’ he ist run
An’ pullt out the stinger, an’ don’t laugh none,
An’ says: “They has be’n folks, I guess,
’At thought I wuz predjudust, more er less,—
Yit I still muntain ’at a Bumblebee
Wears out his welcome too quick fer me!”"
A Barefoot Boy,"A barefoot boy! I mark him at his play—
For May is here once more, and so is he,—
His dusty trousers, rolled half to the knee,
And his bare ankles grimy, too, as they:
Cross-hatchings of the nettle, in array
Of feverish stripes, hint vividly to me
Of woody pathways winding endlessly
Along the creek, where even yesterday
He plunged his shrinking body—gasped and shook—
Yet called the water “warm,” with never lack
Of joy. And so, half enviously I look
Upon this graceless barefoot and his track,—
His toe stubbed—ay, his big toe-nail knocked back
Like unto the clasp of an old pocketbook."
I Have Folded My Sorrows,"I have folded my sorrows into the mantle of summer night,
Assigning each brief storm its allotted space in time,
Quietly pursuing catastrophic histories buried in my eyes.
And yes, the world is not some unplayed Cosmic Game,
And the sun is still ninety-three million miles from me,
And in the imaginary forest, the shingled hippo becomes the gray unicorn.
No, my traffic is not with addled keepers of yesterday’s disasters,
Seekers of manifest disembowelment on shafts of yesterday’s pains.
Blues come dressed like introspective echoes of a journey.
And yes, I have searched the rooms of the moon on cold summer nights.
And yes, I have refought those unfinished encounters.
      Still, they remain unfinished.
And yes, I have at times wished myself something different.
The tragedies are sung nightly at the funerals of the poet;
The revisited soul is wrapped in the aura of familiarity. "
Hanem,"Hanem, we must have met before, 
   Perhaps a thousand years ago; 
I still remember when I tore 
   Your virgin veil of lunar snow. 
By Allah, I remember, too, 
   When, sousing in my mortal bain, 
You bit my lip and said, “Adieu,
   When shall we, Syrian, meet again?”
Hanem, thine eyes are brighter far
    Than when in mine they shone one day; 
I wager every moon and star
    The tax of lustre to them pay. 
And those who dared with them to jest, 
   Where are they now?—those lovers slain
Who whispered dying on your breast, 
   “O Hanem, shall we meet again?”
The victims of your eyes are here, 
   In pyramids they keep their clay; 
And even your sister Flames are near, 
   They fain would kiss my soul away. 
Full many a time from them you bore
   This mortal love, this mortal gain; 
Remember Nubia’s sable shore—
   When shall we, Hanem, meet again? 
Why quickly through the Cairo street?—
   Will you return?—Shall I remain? 
Fate might not ever the chance repeat; 
   When shall we, Hanem, meet again? "

Constantinople,"When Othman’s sword, as Paleologue’s, is broken
And Othman’s gods are smitten to the dust,
And naught remains, not even a rusty token
Of their hierarchal cruelty and lust;—
When church and mosque and synagogue shall be,
Despite the bigot’s cry, the zealot’s prayer,
Unbounded in their bounties all and free
In every heritage divine to share;—
When thou shalt rise, rejoicing in thy loss,
Upon the ruins of a state nefast
To reconcile the Crescent and the Cross
And wash thy hands of thine unholy past;—
When with the faith new-born of East and West,
Which spans the azure heights of man’s desire,
The spirit of thy people, long oppressed,
Is all a-glow with its undying fire;—
When thou thyself, Byzantium, shalt stand
In the minaret of Freedom and thy voice,
Rising above the muazzens in the land,
Bids all the seekers of the light rejoice;—
When in thy heart the flame of freedom sings,
And in thy hand the torch of freedom glows,
And in thy word the sword of freedom rings,
And in thy deed the seed of freedom grows,—
Then shall we call thee Mistress of the Morn,
Bride of the Straits, Queen of the Golden Horn."
The Fruits of Death,"Said the folded Leaves upon the Heath
   To the opening Leaves upon the Tree:
“Soon will the Warders of the Storm
   Bring us to our Mother-Sea,
Even as they opened yesternight
   Our prison doors of Destiny:
We envy not the Birds now nor the Dew;
To them we leave the Forest and to you.”
The infant Leaves thus made reply:
   “But we rejoice that we are here;
We stand in the cerulean Gate
   Of Life to crown the dying Year.
Him who emancipates we love,
   He who enchains is also dear:
You are the Flowers of the Storm, and we,
We are the Fruits of Death upon Life’s tree."
The Song of Siva,"’Tis Night; all the Sirens are silent,
   All the Vultures asleep;
And the horns of the Tempest are stirring
   Under the Deep;
’Tis Night; all the snow-burdened
   Mountains Dream of the Sea,
And down in the Wadi the River
   Is calling to me.
’Tis Night; all the Caves of the Spirit
   Shake with desire,
And the Orient Heaven’s essaying
   Its lances of fire;
They hear, in the stillness that covers
   The land and the sea,
The River, in the heart of the Wadi,
   Calling to me.
’Tis night, but a night of great joyance,
   A night of unrest;—
The night of the birth of the spirit
   Of the East and the West;
And the Caves and the Mountains are dancing
   On the Foam of the Sea,
For the River inundant is calling,
   Calling to me."
Reflections,"I walked along the countryside
At eventide,
And everywhere
The road was fair
With moons of water here and there,
Into whose heart the grasses spied.
And suddenly upon them shone
The light of the City’s eye,
Reflected from a bulb on high.
Which made them and their shadow one,
Nay, made each moon
A mirror seem
To serve the dream
Of tender blades in bending grace a-swoon.
I walked into the night,
And every abode
Beyond the dark, deserted road
Was a prattle of light.
And I thought of the Eye Unseen
Which sheds its charitable sheen,
Not on our goal,
But on the by-ways of the Soul."
The Cataclysm,"Even through the City of the Dead she passed,
Her sack of Horror’s harvest to refill;
And lo, into the untilled world she cast,
With a million hands, the black seeds of her will.
But in the bone-strewn waste I saw a snail
Crawling out of the socket of a skull,
Exultant still;—
Rising from the universal bane
To thank the rain.
And in the thorny flanks of the riven tomb,
Gorged yesteryear with the fruits of fear and doubt
The nations bear when their sinews run out,
I saw the crocus weave her tender bloom
Into the ivy’s tangled hair,
While struggling out of the gloom
To praise the air.
The Cataclysm, passing to her goal.
Turned inside out the pockets of the world,
Not sparing even the altar of the soul,
Which at the cradle of the soul she hurled.
But when at last she fell
Across the sill of hell,
I saw her incalculable toll,
A butterfly
Winging out of the riddled emblem of God
Toward the sky;—
Rising with the faith re-won
To serenade the sun."
The End and the Beginning,"The deed is done, O Kings: the blood is shed:
   The sword is broken:—broken, too, the Cross.
But she, the mother eternal of the dead,
   Though sorrow-laden, smiles at the loss.
You go down grimed with the blood and smoke of wars;
   Your armies scattered and your banners furled;
She comes down covered with the dust of stars,
   And gives her life again to build the world."
The Towers and the Night,"Over the White Way’s flood of light,
Over its sea of fiery flowers,
Arose the voice of the ancient Night
And the youthful Towers:
“O Night of nations passed,” the Towers said,
“One day stood high your monuments, but now
Your highest pyramid must lift its head
To see the lights that crown our City’s brow.”
“But man,” replied the Night, “shall crown the stars
With flowers of thought divine,
And write his name upon a monument
Greater than yours and mine.”"
Dorothy Dances,"This is no child that dances. This is flame.
Here fire at last has found its natural frame.
What else is that which burns and flies
From those enkindled eyes...
What is that inner blaze
Which plays
About that lighted face?...
This thing is fire set free—
Fire possesses her, or rather she
Controls its mastery.
With every gesture, every rhythmic stride,
Beat after beat,
It follows, purring at her side,
Or licks the shadows of her flashing feet.
Around her everywhere
It coils its thread of yellow hair.
Through every vein its bright blood creeps,
And its red hands
Caress her as she stands
Or lift her boldly when she leaps.
Then, as the surge
Of radiance grows stronger
These two are two no longer
And they merge
Into a disembodied ecstasy;
Free
To express some half-forgotten hunger,
Some half-forbidden urge.
What mystery
Has been at work until it blent
One child and that fierce element?
Give it no name.
It is enough that flesh has danced with flame."
huki the gate,"for Kauaʻi paniolo Uncle David Hepa and Uncle Keoki Ka‘eo
huki the gate—
work the lock with your fingers,
pull the smooth wire loop 
over the top of the ʻōhia log post,
grasp the top rail with your right hand,
press your left booted heel
into the warm flank of your mount
the tap of a spur might encourage him
as the gate swings in.
huki the gate—
swing his head around with a tug on the reins,
swing his hindquarters ʻround with a tap of your leg.
Ease back towards the gate, easy, easy;
a steady hand on the rein holds him close
while you drop the latch closed.
huki the gate—
every seasoned paniolo knows how
If you’re lucky it’s made of wood
old ‘ōhi‘a sawed into five foot lengths
or better still, thick railway ties secured 
to an old telephone pole by
strong, well-oiled hinges.
Or maybe galvanized pipe two inches in diameter
welded by uncle and sprayed Krylon black
huki the gate—
some days, it’s the gate from hell.
the barbed wire kine, with two rotted poles and no support.
You lift up the latch and it sags to the ground
like a rusted barbed accordion
just daring you to learn how to play it.
huki the gate—
careful not to drop it,
cuz you no like hea Uncle Frank scold,
“NEVAH GET OFF YAW FAWKIN HAWS! 
WAT? YOU LIKE MAKE?!”
grip it tight with your right hand,
steer your horse with your left,
hold it up, get a grip, maneuver it in place
tap chestnut flanks with your left leg, then right, then left,
guide your horse through with patience
and fortitude. 
huki the gate—
you’re only halfway pau,
sometimes your mount has a mind of his own.
huki the gate—
steady hands and temper are your best allies,
tugging and pulling gate and horse simultaneously
into proper position
huki the gate—
every seasoned paniolo knows
good fences make good neighbors
but getting through good gates
gets you where you want to go."
Waikīkī Returns,"            I do not have any memories of Waikīkī ever being like this
not even in my father’s stories was she so utterly alone.
            No sunburnt tourists, no convertibles on Kalākaua Ave.
not even a leathery beach boy to survey the shoreline.
            Waikiki remembers though
her long curved neck of white sand anchoring
            empty hotels offers herself up to lapping little waves
rushing forward then pulling back again and again.
            Silver flashes of halalū close to the shoreline
hundreds pulsing instinctively forming an arrow
            then bursting into a corona, doubling back with black
eyes and thin fins twisting like the lie
            of a skilled lover, dazzling. The old rock wall under
the newly paved walkway jutting out past the reef
            so clear I can see the outlines of my brother and I
timing the crash of waves, holding hands as we jump
            from the ledge over the white spray
the sucking boom as our bodies
            break the surface while unseen watery hands
push us back up. Perhaps those same hands tickling
            the belly of that honu, its green-gray shell ascending.
Covid has managed the unimaginable, has returned
            Waikīkī to herself. Is it wrong to be so grateful?
I share this early morning quiet with a lone fisherman casting
            near the transplanted kukui nut trees which have no business
being there. The thin nylon line invisible against
            the slowly brightening sky and I never want anyone to return.
The drumming shoreline, gleam of the gold crucifix against
            the fisherman’s chest, salty air on my cheek—
all of it strengthening our way back into the light."
She Went Out Singing,"She went out singing, and the poppies still
  Crowd round her door awaiting her return; 
She went out dancing, and the doleful rill
   Lingers beneath her walls her news to learn. 

Their love is but a seed of what she has sown;
Their grief is but a shadow of my own. 

O Tomb, O Tomb! did Zahra’s beauty fade, 
  Or dost thou still preserve it in thy gloom? 
O, Tomb, thou art nor firmament nor glade, 
   Yet in thee shines the moon and lilies bloom. "
From the Arabic,"Why art thou so hushed and sad, 
  So thin and wan? 
Who robbed thee of thy flesh and song,—
  Was it Ramadhan? 
Nay, Ramadhan is not to blame, 
   For I have ceased to fast and pray; 
But to my vacant Dwelling came 
   An unknown Guest—he came to stay. 
And in my heart he eats and drinks; 
   He drinks my blood, of wines the best, 
And eats my burning flesh,—ah, yes, 
   My love for Zahra is that Guest. "
The Lost Disciple,"O Master, I can not adventure with thee; 
  At the Door of the Dawn, in my lone wandering, 
I have broken my staff; for the true dawn is she 
  Who comes every day with her jar to the spring. 
Ay, Master, I tarried last night at the gate
   Of her garden, which kisses the Lake Galilee; 
She was gathering flowers and fruits for the Fete, 
   And with tulips and poppies she beckoned to me. 
In her lamp there was oil, in my hand there was fire; 
   In her house cried a voice, ‘O make haste with the flame!’
On my lips were the names of the daughters of Tyre, 
   On her breast were the lilies that whispered thy name. 
I have dared, O my Master, to envy thy feet, 
   And to yearn for the love of a Magdalen fair; 
I have dreamed that mine, too, in the heart of the street, 
   Were laved with her own hands and dried with her hair. 
O Master, my lips her devotion have stained, 
  For her soul’s precious ointments were offered late; 
I have lost in the fire of my lust what I gained 
   In my longing and love for her love and thy fate. "
The Pagan,"I walked into her Temple, as of yore
  My Tyrian sires, allured by cryptic signs; 
But sudden as I entered closed the door 
  Upon the hope that mortal love resigns
   Before her ancient, myrtle-bowered shrines. 
I sorrowed not; though every lamp I lit 
  Flamed up in speech articulate and said, 
Beware, O foolish Worshipper! ’t is writ:
   “Who craves a gift shall give his soul instead, 
    Who lights a lamp is curséd of the dead.”
I did not heed; I passed from shrine to shrine, 
   Filling the lamps with oil, the Fane with light; 
But when I approached, O One Eternal, thine, 
   I heard the terror of her tongue, and Night 
   Was creeping on her brow of malachite. 
I did not stop, although the votive oil
   I poured into thine urn to water turned; 
But when the Dawn her enchantments came to foil, 
    The secret of thy clemency I learned—
    Again the oil thine altar burned. 
The suddenly the Temple shook and swayed, 
   And all the shrines, except thine, disappeared; 
Even so her heart, by knowledge undismayed, 
   On Love’s one altar with thy hand upreared, 
   To Love’s one God is evermore endeared. "
Beans,"They’re not like peaches or squash.
Plumpness isn’t for them. They like
being lean, as if for the narrow
path. The beans themselves sit qui-
etly inside their green pods. In-
stinctively one picks with care, 
never tearing down the fine vine,
never noticing their crisp bod-
ies, or feeling their willingness for
the pot, for the fire.
I have thought sometimes that
something—I can’t name it—
watches as I walk the rows, accept-
ing the gift of their lives to assist
mine.
I know what you think: this is fool-
ishness. They’re only vegetables.
Even the blossoms with which they
begin are small and pale, hardly sig-
nificant Our hands, or minds, our
feet hold more intelligence. With
this I have no quarrel. 
But, what about virtue?"
Our Red Road,"This morning I didn’t even honi you when I came in.
I just walked right by your shallow breath,
your eyes shut in the living room, and that bed
stuffed with pulu. And all the blurred words
projecting onto the backs of your eyelids.
Ke alanui maʻawe ‘ula a Kanaloa…
I organize your prescription bottles like kiʻi
along the edges of the kitchen heiau
and try to remember how long it’s been
since you strung a sentence together
and draped it over my shoulders.
I grew up mountain view and I can always see
mauna kea and mauna loa same time
In the afternoon I thicken your drinking water,
obsessing on what you’ll want for the road, and pack
some paʻi ʻai a me ka iʻa. Bundled guesswork
disguised as intention once the oceans open up.
I keep a version of you in my pocket that asks,
Maybe this red road is not mine, but ours, Boy?
So make some food for you, too.
In the evening I sit you up and our eyes trace the octopus’s
footprints moonlit in the yard grass. You smile
and gulp the thick water, and I keep obsessing
about which muʻumuʻu you’ll want to wear in the waʻa."
pronunciation,"For now, we speak only in brooms:
         sweeping sand across the teeth 
of concrete slabs, we brush and repeat 
         each stone syllable of the clearing
where our great grandparents are buried. 
Some words for memory are always here, 
         sounded out by the ant feet 
hefting sand grit and glitter homes, fan-light
         over the blue tongues of plastic flowers— 
the weeds will try to cover all the other ways 
         of saying history. 
But our pronunciation begins with the clearing we make in our bodies first:
where the broom handle widens the oh’s 
         in the mouth of our hands, 
how we shake open the throat 
         to settle each pile of leaves before burning them.
Trust the body to open in our language
         with the rhythm of weight—
one hand pushing sand, 
         the other pulling syllables
in one last sway 
         as we close the gate of the malaʻe 
so the trees can better hiss-hush at the edge of the ancestor 
         speaking in all our names."
"Lei Kukui, Lei Kuahu","The impermanence of lei
On dark altars of stone
A dream of lei kukui
Placed on the kuahu
Coils of lush green leaves
Fragrant leaf stems neatly knotted
Plaited along a backspine
Joined one to the other
Bound by a fast symmetry
Calling forth 
The spectral presences
Of our gods 
We seek your permission,
That you will hear 
Our importunate prayers
Our songs through the far forests
And as with birds
Contemn their dark silences with light;
We seek your companionship,
On our right shoulders and left
Above us and below
The surround of your playful
And somber accompaniments
Your presences in our gardens
Your residencies on our altars;
We seek wakefulness,
That we long slumbering
Yet evanescent
Will become luminous
As leaves on brightened paths;
We seek your acceptance,
That the hidden canopies
Will reveal themselves
Each bright leaf 
Giving itself of its own accord;
We seek resonance,
From the tops of our heads
To the bottoms of our feet
From the center of our chests
To the leaf tips of our hands
We seek all of these things—
A purer correspondence 
With the radiance of leaves."

A Death Song,"Lay me down beneaf de willers in de grass,

Envy,"for Rita
he is going back to his atoll
where the women still go topless
and the men wear pwundosi
to spread the word of God
“no more sexting,” I say
“Ai adai, they don’t even have phones over there do they!?” my friend asks
“They do! and internet too!”
“Really?” 
“Yea, they just don’t wear panty or deodorant,” I say.
We laugh our annoying island laughs. 
Lucky them."
Do/Do Not,"I sniff the blooming tiger lily,
two tongues sprung open
from one mouth.
I poison the river unintentionally.
I walk on the designated paths.
I splice the mountain, its body and mouth gaping.
I collect rainwater in a wheelbarrow.
I line the whale’s belly with gifts until
they rupture its stomach.
I water the strawberries.
Again I fill my gas tank with dead things,
generations spun together until shiny.
I feed the ducks fresh lettuce.
I maneuver the dead squirrel
on the road, mark the moment
when creature becomes meat.
I accept that my love is a
poisonous flower, routinely fatal.
I calculate the force of
loving in each glittering death.
All day on this land, in the
deep forest, the electric greens and
still-wet mud writhe with life.
The pond gurgles and whispers.
Everyone here knows to shudder
when they see me coming.
The mangos arrive unbruised
at the grocery store.
The wolves should start running."
Bilingualism,"I saw my grandmother on a billboard
stretched out in a green dress like a snake
out on a walk alone in swamp maples.
Reclining, smoking a cigarette as though
an advertisement for bourbon in a casino,
watching me and never intending to speak.
Not a single wood chip of a word,
would not give up a single playing card of a leaf.
All I could think was, Who was she
to sell anything to, her poles rusty
in that expanse of reeds and skunk cabbage,
with a weasel animal that slipped off into shallows...?
Replaced in a few weeks by an ad for a local optometrist.
That was the one time I saw my grandmother.
Such was the first and last time I saw my grandmother."
Moving Day,"That painting with the stack of framed poems,
the one with the stairs that give you a fright
shown just a bit in the left corner,
stairs that lead up to the bell tower
and a panorama of a great religious city
with gold bells like giant overturned cups,
where the pots hang around
like copper-bottomed clouds
and there’s a pitch-black melon on a plate
on a table with two legs under a cracked window,
I bring the whole first stanza in and hang it up
in this bare example of a room,
the spider too. Details of the impasto soup
waft up in dotted lines, reaching
for the painting in which 1.) top poem
is covered with marks of looking
like pieces of packaging tape.
2.)  bottom poem is translated into
an ultraviolet language, Latin."
The Gallery,"A stack of framed poems
leans against a well-lit wall
at the back of a painting,
like a layer of clouds
beneath a skylight,
each of the five poems
in a heavy black frame of emphasis.
It’s moving day
into a Dutch kitchen,
into an Italian atelier, under a Mansard roof
brass ladles and copper-bottomed pots,
a cleaned rabbit, scullery basket of potatoes,
a clan of obese clouds.
First thing, I hang the poems in a row
over the pots and pans, over the bloom
of detail, where they act as emphasized clouds
while the melon mentioned in the last
rolls away from a still-life."

The Word,"A woman is walking a word that’s ½ a poodle
near this cursive gate where you’re standing & reading
“A woman is walking a word that’s ½ a poodle,”
that’s an –ism, that’s an act, state, process,
doctrine, theory or cult, past my name,
past the TOBACCO shop, the FRUIT shoppe
with bananas like hands on an American flag
& serrated watermelon; she passes the Happy Face
& many other pedestrians; past the little church
with the black and white tiled rhyme
then the carefully mown slogans that are golf courses:
Just Do It, Milk, It Does a Body Good,
the open air market where oranges and pears
are stacked as semi-colons &
past the sentence in block letters that endlessly cir-
culates as the air conditioning for buildings B thru D.
A woman is walking a word that’s ½ a poodle.
A felt green gentleman at a pencil-d in café table, chair, ob-
serves that the same woman passes with the same dog
every 5 seconds or it’s 3 blue and white W’s in a row
made of gel and foam, then 3 lower case b’s.
She’s out buying a bayonet of bread.
Above, in the yellow sky, a phrase drifts.
At the third word of this poem,
right in front of my house the stanza,
the dog writes a single letter “s,” an anus fruit,
a pasty cookie, on the sidewalk: PLEASE CURB YOUR DOGs
I am just a scribble. Between the woman and the dog
there’s a gap of 3 typed spaces in which she controls him
with the leash of spelling,
mis-. Madeleine knows there’s a snake of consciousness
hibernating under the ground, a cemetery for shapes,
blobs, blots, objects without names,
and so the gap widens & it’s here that the dog flees,
landscape in the distant corner of the gap
and a dragon."
Bird Saver,"ONE TUBE OF BIRD SONG joins the next
pipes fill the room with random action,
follow each other around, link arms
shadowy vectors and ducts of half made-
out sounds right behind, follow each other
under the ceiling fan in the rented room
over the mattress drifting above bed springs
as a dirty cloud, above the radiator that says,
quote cloud unquote.
                         On a room that wavers, darkens, will reset,
pipes that come in three colors—promenade,
hacking, and white listening—a listening-to-opera-while-
cooking-dinner-near-an-open-window-in-early-spring—
and the do-si-do is on the brite green lawn,
a wallpaper of blossoms in the window pane.
                                                   Unlike the view
into a room that is periodically bricked over,
the villa with an urn of pitch-black flowers on a vine,
or the origami of other birds the Baltimore oriole
folded over the cardinal over the cedar waxwing
let’s mate! let’s mate! there’s still room to think,
to move around under the pipes,
a wallpaper of blossoms in the window pane.
The fly carries around its action like a wire hat."
In the courtyard,"Some mauve words, some beaded trees:
this part of spring overwhelms me,
each planted tree a comparison
done in seed pearls, a version
onto which strips of lilac felt are pressed
then held in place for a few seconds
above a generalized base—
as though created by someone skilled with a glue gun
& the types of detail I’m no good at.
I can’t compete: what I’ve done
stands toward the back of the courtyard near the church wall,
a few fuzzy words from several years ago.
That one of the words has turned a shade of ochre
that's hard to come by—that I’ve been trying to put my hands
         on for years—
purely by chance (plus exposure to a few
back-to-back winters) is most discouraging."

Sonnet branches,"The forearm of spring rests on the window sill      
to the kitchen where I’m boiling opera for pasta.
This branch of spring is a real interloper,
a man’s arm covered in hard yellow blossoms,
No. 2 yellow, like a line of forsythia
in inter-winter-spring. Other sonnet branches
are scattered in the backyard, fourteen limbs
decked out in the darling buds of May.
The man’s branch intrudes through the open
window in early spring, so it’s a line in a poem.  
Those italicized and underlined branches
about timeless beauty, a love w/out physical detail,
maybe the pivot toward writing and the writer,
I’ll have to pick up after them after dinner,
I’ll organize w/ a ladybug red wheelbarrow,
kindling for prose or a Triskelion."
The Battle of Silicon Valley at Daybreak,"In a countryside green as a dollar bill,
with the much handled commercial vegetation
from around mall parking lots or in freeway divides,
in a landscape where the wireless has been shut off,
emoji are at war. Emoji are at war
in the mural outside the employee cafeteria
for reading The Things They Carried or Yellow Birds
or The Red Badge of Courage: instead of eating,
emoji are at war.
Outfitted in a list supplied by Wikipedia,
(breastplates, gauntlets, steel collars, mail shirts,
vambrace, pouldron, bassinet, barbute, aventail),
chain armor from a 3-d printer for a smaller budget,
emoji are at war: Blushing Emoji, Frustrated, Weeping,
Smiling Emoji near the village firewall,
& a thousand spears like toothpicks,
emoji are at war.
It’s like Where’s Waldo. It’s like Pac Man.
I spot with my little eye in the “watch-fires of a hundred
circling camps” two generals outside a recharging tent,
a tiny banner unfurling PRIVACY  *  NET NEUTRALITY 
* DEREGULATION. Sound of emoji blood
as the Smiling Emoji advance, swallowing everything,
going postal, kamikaze, road rage, suicide bomber
“hurling down to the House of Death so many sturdy souls,”
sound of emoji blood.
A sword pierces Blushing Emoji #956, Pram’s son,
below the groin, and “the dark came whirling down
across his eyes”; a hurled spear is shot through the temple of
Angry Emoji #23, only son of Matthew Thornton
of Boston, and “the dark came swirling thick across his eyes,”
sound of emoji blood. Sound of Emoji blood as Weeping
Emoji #3,418, daughter of the river god, a bullet
plunging into her lung, lodges in the “mortal spot,”
scream fumes.
Outside the village firewall, internet access was slowing
way, way down until the CEO who has her eye on Jim,
a Cubicle Emoji, petitions the Board of Directors
to rescue Jim from his jangling fate of war, seduces him,
gives birth to a daughter ½ Hollywood, ½ New Jersey mortal,
with a weak ankle…Emoji were at war.
                         The CAPS LOCK is on,
so this story ends at the door to the men’s restroom.
For we have seen,
I have seen, you have seen, they have seen how emoji blood sounds
like a ring tone of a 50 gun salute in a thousand wavy ploughed
lines, lines, lines, lines where truth is marching on."

The Flame Tree,"My neighbor has decided to poison the flame tree.
He is right, of course.
The tree is over 20 years old, huge, spreading,
and the termites have worn jagged roads clear to its top.
It’s clearly a danger
tilting toward our house—
some fickle wind
my neighbor says could blow it over. 
Every fañomnåkan, it sends out its bursts of orange blossoms;
it blooms and blooms and blooms relentlessly,
the flares it sends shooting out into space
more stunning than fireworks 
through the window
where my mother
riveted to a bed, doomed by her body to a colorless spot, 
gazes out, her head on a pillow—
might have seemed like forever to her who used to climb green mountain sides—
and watches that tree full of sparrows
chittering
chattering
flitting here and there
and the outlandish blazing petals
steadfastly singing against the blue sky.
My neighbor, true to his word,
injected a poisonous brew bought at Home Depot into the trunk of the tree,
the toxic river
traveling up up up following the termite trails to the heart 
of the fire.
He is right, of course.
The tree came back the following year,
its clusters unflinchingly parading their bursts of rebellious orange.
But the poison had done its work—
see, where there was a canopy of flames
there are now just a handful here and there,
one spray in particular desperately
reaching out 
like a fist full of beauty 
to the window
where she 
used to watch for its return."

The Song of Rain,"Allah is merciful, Allah is kind,
His heart, in the tears of the earth, is enshrined;
                   He chains the desire
                   Of whirlwind and fire:—
The Drought, the Simoon and their forces entire,
In the fast spreading shades of his pity, suspire;—
                   It rains, it rains.
Allah is gracious, Allah is sweet,
The desert is flowering under his feet;
                   E’en the fires he fanned,
                   And the mountains they spanned,
And the caverns that groan under burdens of sand
Are dazed with the bounties that flow from his hand;—
                   It rains, it rains!  
Allah’s all-seeing, Allah is wise,
The palm from the stone to praise him shall rise;
                   The deer in the dale,
                   The plant in the shale,
The bird in the nest, and the gull in the gale
Are joyously chanting, Hail, Allah, hail!
                   It rains, it rains!
Allah is mighty, Allah is great,
His hands all things resuscitate;
                   He burns the shroud,
                   He shakes the cloud,
And the dead of the earth with new life are endowed,—
The bones of the earth are joyous and proud;—
                   It rains, it rains!"
Water and Flowers,"Here are flowers, O my Beloved,
    Here are flowers;
Let us lay our hearts today
    Among the flowers;
Let us not be led astray
By the mirage far away;
    Here is verdure, and in verdure
        Love embowers.
Here are springs, O my beloved.
    Here are springs;
Let us rest and build a nest
    Near the springs;
Let us cease our weary quest
For the mountains of the blest;
    Here is water, and in water
        Blessing sings."
Prayer in the Desert,"O Lord of Bounties, melt thy heaven’s breath,
Which spreads its gold around the head of Death,—
Which, while it smiles, devours all living things,
Giving to Desolation wondrous wings:
Lest in the waste Arabia’s star should wane,
A little rain, Allah, a little rain.
Thou Bountiful, thy Sun is weaving fast
The shroud of Earth now in the sand-storm cast;
Earth can not weep,—the well of faith is run,—
Its rivers and its desert sands are one:
O thou Bestower, once more sustain
Thy sun-crowned Daughter with a little rain.
Quiet this rising phantom-haunted sea
Of sands; the Faithful from its fury free;
Enchain the monsters of the dire simoom,—
Let not the desert be thy children’s tomb.
Thou Merciful, assist us to attain
Our goal,––a little rain, a little rain!
Arabia’s thousand wounds to thee appeal,
And with our lips its gaping wounds we seal;
Prostrate upon the sands we lift our hearts,
Pierced in thy presence by thy flaming darts.
Thy children, Allah, in the throes of pain,
Pray for a little rain, a little rain!"
In the Palm Groves of Memphis,"The Khamsin* comes comes robed in the Lybian sands,
   Veiled in the haze of June,
Armed with Sahara’s serpent-wreathed brands,
   Shod with the sun and moon;
Swift winging in a cycloramic flame,—
Of Typhon born, unseeing and untame,—
She comes her reign of terror proclaim,
   While crowning day and night with all the blazonry of tropic noon.
She claps her iridescent wings, and lo!
   The rolling heat,
Tremulous, reverberant, a-glow,
   Sibilant, fleet,
Sweeps over the land with unabating ire,
Devouring Spring’s heritage entire,
Setting the very pyramids a-fire,
   Engulfing even the turtle’s shelter and the turtle-dove’s retreat.
Alas! where are the roses which the prime
    Of summer share
With the sesame, the myrtle and the thyme
    In meadows fair?
Where is the sacred lotus and the bloom
Of cumin and mimosa, whose perfume
Once filled the shrine of Isis and her tomb?
    Where is the pomegranate flower that shone in Cleopatra’s hair?
Where is the riant beauty of the land
    Of mystic runes
That decorates its shimmering robes of sand
    With emerald moons?
Where are the emerald shelters, desert-bound,
That with the prayer of caravans resound?
Where is the desert trail, the watering ground
    That murmurs low of lost oases amidst the fast dissolving dunes?
Where is the caravan that yesternight,
    To the merry sound
Of bells, set out of the city of delight
    To Nubia bound?
Where is the Nubian caravan that late
Passed heavy-laden through Denderah’s gate,
Speeding to reach the city for the fete,
    When gold and silver freely flow, when Allah’s bounties abound?
Where is the crested lark, the golden thrush
     Of the sacred grove,
Which made the sensitive acacia blush
     And bloom with love?
Where has the bearded bustard fallen? where
Is Ibis, once the pet of Hermes fair,
Nursing his purple wings and his despair?
     Where is the red flamingo hiding, where’s the house of the turtle-dove?
Across the welkin, like a shadow cast
     Upon a cloud, but one
Undaunted dips his black wings in the blast
     And rears anon
His form against the rushing winds; alone
The vulture hovers around the flame-draped throne
Of Death, and over the palms that rock and moan,
     Peering through the desolation, staring at the laughing sun.
And Khamsin, in her chariot of fire,
     Upon which clings
The moult of her unsatiable desire,
     Delirious sings,
And shakes the harvest from her tangled hair—
The sesame seeds, the grasses sere, the tare,
The golden tassels which the rushes wear,
     The purple feathers of the ibis and the swallow’s shrivelled wings.
She shakes her booty from her sapphire tresses
    In gleeful guile,
As she in passing savagely caresses
    The crouching Nile;
While everywhere, within her sight or call,
Along its banks or in its rushes tall,
All things are swooning in her leaden thrall,—
    Yea, prostrate is the salamander, prostrate is the crocodile.
And when at intervals her madness takes
    A sudden turn,
A lull ensues and over Egypt breaks
    The sacred urn
Of silence; while to quench her ancient thirst,
Which licked up every running stream and cursed
Every pool in cave or hollow nursed,
    She plunges deep into the Nile and wonders why his waters burn.
And wonders too when in the winnowed sands,
    Out of the gloom
Of labyrinthine avenues and lands
    Of mystic bloom,
Arise the scents of blossoms that have known
Ten thousand Khamsins, and were often blown
To dust ere Menes sat upon his throne—
    The blossoms of the teeming depths that float above the crest of doom.
Yea, and in the scattered dust of Ptah,
    The flawless gleam
That once shone in the fane of Amen-Ra
    Would fain redeem
From darkness of immemorial time,
Which swallowed Thebes and Memphis in their prime,
The symbol of a heritage sublime,
    And light again the sacred temple of the world’s eternal dream.
For though the earth itself should perish in
    A flaming pyre.
And the wasting sun should like a spider spin
    His cobwebs of fire,
Yet in the serdabs under Khamsin’s feet,
Around the blue of Osiris’s judgement seat,
Is this, which glyphs vermilion repeat:—
    The sun of thought, of faith, of God shall never expire, shall never expire.
Albeit, in a mocking gust she veers
            Into the gloom
That knows nor time nor sun, nor ever hears
    The voice of Doom:
And, rifling the bejewelled gods, she drops
    The veil of splendor from her howdah’s tops
And rocks in state from Karnak to Cheops
    To tramp the dust of Pharoah’s pride, to smite the phantom of his tomb.
But mocking Khamsin, when her mood is spent,
    Lulls the morn
In luscious breezes swooning with the scent
    Of love reborn;––
Carressing winds! the tree senescent grows
In you as young as fruitful, and the rose
Upon the bistre lips of Ramesis blows,
    Whispering of things immortal in the wandering seed and the reed forlorn.
She passes in phantasmagoric waves
    Over shifting dunes,
Through shattered orbs, beyond the barren caves
    Of mouldering moons,
While the antique youth the Sun, as young to-day
As when the cricket first essayed her lay,
Across the flood of Nilus makes his way,
    And with him weaves for Egypt wondrous summer garlands and galloons.
And lo, the Khamsin of the world, in flames
    Of crimson hue
And clouds of vitriolic dust, proclaims
    The era new;
But through the storm a spirit wings his flight
Across the phosphorescent gulfs of night,
And this, upon the rising sun, doth write:—
    God liveth, yea, God liveth still and man shall nothing rue.
 
*A dry wind from the Sahara that prevails in Egypt
about fifty days. Hence its name—Khamsin."
Andalusia,"I
Alcazar
There was a rhapsody in all her moods,
     A child-like grace, a passion unrestrained;
     Her throne, which bard and saki shared, was stained
With virgin wine as with the blood of feuds;
And in her lyric-woven interludes,
     Epitomizing destiny and time,
     Her spirit, hid in opalescent rhyme,
The shades of Melancholy still eludes.
Where’er she trod, the rose and bulbul meet;
    Where’er she revelled, gardens ever blow;
Where’er she danced, the henna of her feet
    Yet lends a lustre to the poppy’s glow;—
Arabia, dark-eyed, light-hearted, fair,
Is but a flower in Andalusia’s hair.
  II
Alhambra
 
Gods of the silence, still remembering
    The dying echoes of her lute, bemoan,
    In canticles of golden monotone,
Her Orient splendor too soon vanishing;
And while lions guard her courts, grey eagles wing
    Around her turqoise domes, and seedlings blown
    From distant lands to her hushed fountains cling,
Yea, and the sun himself sits in her throne.
Time, once her vassal, lingers near the streams
    That woo the shadows of her crumbling walls,
And, musing of Alhambra’s glory, dreams
    Of Elegance and Power in Myrtle Halls;—
Arabia, once counted of the strong,
Is but a sigh in Andalusia’s song.
  III
The Mosque
In the bewildering grove of colonnades,
    Once brilliant with a flood of saffron light,
    Poured from ten thousand lanterns day and night,
Her memory, like spikenard in the glades
Of distant lnd or Yemen, never fades;
    And her devotion, though the ages blight
    The mystic bloom of her divine delight,
Still casts on alien altars longing shades.
But through the mihrabs which the humble hand
    Of genius wrought, o’er marbles hollowed deep
By knees that only Piety could command,
    I see Oblivion coming forth to reap;—
Arabia, in Allah’s chaplet strung,
Is but a word on Andalusia’s tongue.
  IV
Al-Zahra
Not with the Orient glamor of her pleasures,
    Nor with fond rhapsodies of prayer or song
    Could she her sovereign reign a day prolong;
Not in the things of beauty that man measures
By the variable humor of his leisures,
    Or by the credibilities that change
    From faith to fantasy to rumor strange,
Was she the mistress of immortal treasures.
But when the holy shrine Europa sought,
    Herself of sin and witchcraft to assoil,
The sovereigns of Al-Zahra maxims wrought
    And Averroes burned his midnight oil;—
Arabia, the bearer of the light,
Still sparkles in the diadem of Night."

"God of the Distances, Hear Us","                                 I
God of the Distances, hear us—
Hear us and guide us today.
Thy footsteps, though never so near us,
Are lost in the dust of the fray.
Thy high priests, who have often spoken
The word that was heeded, are mute ;
Their torch is extinguished ; their token
Is distrust and discord and dispute.
God of the Distances, never
Was man, though still fettered, so free
To challenge his star and to sever
Himself from the past and from thee.
But we, though our spirit is broken,
We heed thee again and anon ; 
We trust thee, O God, though thy token
Be the desert, thy promise, the sun.
Forever the Distances call us—
The Distances veiled of the Dream ;
And we come, whatsoever befall us,
Our pledges and thine to redeem.
We come ; and though often we altered
Our course at the gates of dismay,
We never looked backward or faltered,
Never regretted our way.
God of the Distances, hear us—
Hear us and guide us today.
                                 II
From the cave of the first Dream we wandered
Through the forests of Fate and of Chance ;
And on many an illusion we squandered
The treasures of Faith and Romance.
We fared with the Fairies of noontide,
We roved with the Jinn of the night ;
Our high priests we left on the wayside,
Our prophets we lost on the height
Of rebellion recurrent. We passed
Many a temple and shrine,
Where the sherds of old creeds were recast
And traded as tokens divine.
We passed them, forever consoled
And cajoled by the Voice,—’T is the way
Of your goal ; your forebodings allay.”
But thousands of cycles we told,
Millions of leagues we unrolled,
Heedless of Time and his sway.
God of the visions of old,
Hear us and guide us today.
                               III
We sailed all the Seas of the Mind,
We rounded the Capes of the Soul,
We crossed all the Channels that roll
Over the dead of our kind.
And on many a beckoning strand,
Furrowed with silvery streams,
We lingered, but lo, in the land
Were the desolate gardens of dreams.—
Onward ! the sails of Desire,
Born of the Distances’ fire,
Tattered but ever unfurled,
To worlds undiscovered aspire—
To the life-giving worlds of our world.
Onward ! though no signs appear
Where once rose the phares of the Seer
And the Prophet. On, on ! to the goal,
Though veiled in the billows that roll
Over Orion.—The fear
Of the Distances never was liege
Of our hearts ; but the Mazes besiege
The bridges of Faith on our way.
God of our vision austere,
Hear us and guide us today.
                                 IV
Hear us the Captains of Sorrow,—
The tillers of the soil of defeat,—
The lights of the oft promised morrow,
Whose false dawns thy promise repeat.
Our name and our purpose are written
In blood on the tablets of Time ;
Our spirit, though frequently smitten
To the dust, has arisen, sublime
And triumphant, again and again ;
Our torch, though extinguished, was never
Relinquished ; our sword and our pen
Are brandished forever and ever.
Yea, the Ideal’s undying desire
And the wreaths of defeat it has won,
Their story, in letters of fire,
Is limned on the brow of the sun.
And not till a new world ’s begotten
Of the womb of our own, will the word
Of the soul of the earth be forgotten,
Or the cry of the earth be unheard.
’T is our word, ’t is our cry, ’t is our yearning,
Which shall mark even the ending of Time ;
For no cycle of darkness returning
Shall reach to the path we must climb,
Or efface from our sight the supernal
Beauty of Truth born of Dream.
God of the vision eternal,
We are thine, though in darkness we seem,
But hear us, O hear us today
And help us again to our way.
 "
from “Copy”,"translated from the Spanish by Robin Myers
To reassemble oneself. Proactivity, opportunism: an order. 
A tongue,  leaving.   A gesture, setting sail:   a singular place. 
You’re the one who  answers  the interrogations,  the one who 
stops,  identity in hand,  at every checkpoint.  Copiously.  You, 
not I, are the loser.  Copiously.  The bad traffic, suspect of the 
rage spilling out onto the world.  You’re the one drowning in 
your own shadow.  You live because another five hundred sol-
diers  were  tasked   with  your  disappearance.  To  reassemble 
oneself.  You, not I, are the one who responds:  my chest hides 
nothing but the dark honey of the one with neither place nor exit."
Satan,"Translated by George Dimitri Selim
Satan came to me in my dream
desirous to dispute with me.
With his frightful horns and flaming eyes
he got close to me.
“Go away!” I said, “Beat it, damn you!
Don’t disturb my thoughts.”  
“I came to entertain you,” he said,
“with my knowledge, skill, and experience.
Answer me! Who are you?”
“One of the sages of the earth,” I said,
“Or haven’t you heard of my fame?
I have filled the world with poetry
Won’t you softly murmur my poems in hell?”
He burst out laughing
at my talk in surprise and scorn.
“Is there hope for wisdom on earth,
or for goodness from its evil people?
If people were just
they would exalt my value in their hearts.
When God created them,
He knew that they would disobey Him forever.
He built them hell,
and chose me to punish them and take revenge.
It’s because of them that He threw me in the abyss,
and I lost my might, authority, and power.
Between them and my Lord I was the victim.
Woe unto them!
The fire of hell did not frighten them,
nor did they learn from my fall.
They persisted in their doom,
disturbing God’s peace and mine,
and my patience.
Since they erected hell among themselves
my home is vacant of devils.
They all reside in people’s souls,
striving for evil and harm.
Don’t you see them
making servants of fuel and wind,
flying in space like birds,
hurling fire at mankind,
heedless of harm and destruction?
Don’t you see them on earth
surging and agitated like lions and leopards?
Don’t you see them
making the whales captives,
causing death to rage,
and the interior of the seas to tremble?
How could Moses think
that the Lord created man
– from the very beginning – in His image?
I die of shame
when they say that they are my followers.”
In the intensity of my anger
I struck Satan for despising men.
But when I woke up
and my eyes wandered over the newspaper,
and saw life a torrent of fire
in a hell of horrors and dangers, I said:
“Contentious though they might be
Satan’s words are true.”"
The Two Brothers,"In the grotto the forest designed,
   Where the fire-fly first dreamed of the sun
And the cricket first chirped to the blind
    Zoophyte,—in the cave of the mind
    We were born and our cradle is one.
We are brothers : together we dwelt
    Unknown and unheard and unseen
For aeons ; together we felt
The urge of the forces that melt
    The rocks into willowy green.
For aeons together we drifted
    In the molten abysses of flame,
While the cycles our heritage sifted
From the vapor and ooze, and uplifted
    The image that now bears our name.
I am God : thou art Man : but the light
    That mothers the planets, the sea
Of star-dust that roofs every height
Of the Universe, the gulfs of the night,—
    They are surging in thee as in me.
 But out of the Chaos, to lead us,
    The Giants that borrow our eyes
And lend us their shoulders, must heed us;—
They yield us their purpose, they deed us
    Forever the worlds and the skies. "
A Sufi Song,"My heart ’s the field I sow for thee,
For thee to water and reap;
My heart ’s the house I ope for thee,
For thee to air and dust and sweep;
My heart ’s the rug I spread for thee,
For thee to dance or pray or sleep;
My heart ’s the pearls I thread for thee,
For thee to wear or break or keep;
My heart ’s a sack of magic things—
Magic carpets, caps and rings—
To bring thee treasures from afar
And from the Deep."
Renunciation,"At eventide the Pilgrim came
   And knocked at the Belovéd’s door.
“Whose there!” a voice within, “Thy name?”
   “ ’T is I,” he said.—“Then knock no more.
As well ask thou a lodging of the sea,—
There is no room herein for thee and me.”
The Pilgrim went again his way
   And dwelt with Love upon the shore 
Of self-oblivion; and one day
   He knocked again at the Belovéd’s door.
   “Whose there?”—“It is thyself,” he now replied,
And suddenly the door was opened wide."
The Road of Make-Believe,"                                  I
She sits upon a rock along the stream
     That heard the whisper of her first Desire,
Washing the faded garment of her Dream,
     Which she had often carried to the Dyer—
     The Dream of her self-centred lyric fire.
And in the flowing, scarlet wounds of Twilight,
     Expiring on Aurora’s drooping wings
Beneath the secret scimitar of Night,
     She dyes again her garment, while she sings
     Of new-born love, though to self-love she clings.
                                 II
He seeks the path of glory in the noon
     Of self-intoxication, dreaming still
Of power,—wondering why the sun and moon
     Are not yoked to the chariot of his will.
     His soul, a clinging vine, his mind, an ill,
He beats against the peaks of earth-bound dreams,
     Subsisting on the thistles of his heart,
But ever seeking, in the fitful gleams
     Of his own fire, self-admiration’s mart
     To mend his horn or whet his venomed dart.
                                 III
They walk together in the golden vast
     Of vision-haunted, soul-alluring sands,
Beholding the illusions of the past
     Among the ruins of deserted lands:—
     Together, although neither understands
The groping purpose of the other; and yet,
     While in their hearts the gods of conflict nod,
They gloze and smile, dissembling their regret:
     Love, on the Road of Make-Believe, they prod, 
     He going to the dogs and she, to God. "
Throbbings,"translated by George Dimitri Selim
Zaynab complained against me
to the judge of love.
“He has sly eyes,” she told him,
which roam around me
to devour my beauty.
Judge of love!
I am not safe anymore.
“I think his eyes are two bees
raiding the honey
which sweetens my lips.
I see them as two eagles
hovering in space,
descending to snatch me.
I think, and from my fear,
I think strange things.
God knows how much I suffer from my thoughts.
“He invaded me with his eyes
and, as if this weren’t enough,
he tried to lower my standing among people.
Hypocritically, he said
that I have stolen my beauty from the universe,
and that it was not created naturally in me.
That I have plundered the morning for a face,
the dusk for hair,
uniting both in me.
That from the gardens
I have stolen the flowers for cheeks
—my cheeks are rosy.
That I have covered my neck with pure snow,
and that my eyes are tinted with narcissus.
“When my voice enchanted him
he denied it, and said:
‘It’s a nightingale singing in the garden.’
With sword-like glances I struck him,
he said, and in his deep-red blood
I dyed my finger tips
and in his poems he chanted alluding to me.
So people said:
‘His meanings are necklaces of pearls.’
Lord of verdicts!
Administer your justice between us.
Enough of his straying in love.
I’ve had enough!”
When the time of complaint was over,
the judge asked me:
“What is your answer,
you who are so passionately in love?”
I said:
“I find…that I am a criminal.
My insanity may not be deferred.
She has dispossessed me
of mind and heart.”"
A Chant of Mystics,"                            I
From the Mist of Arcana we rise,
Through the Universe of Secrets we come,
And we enter the Tavern as Lovers,
Whose features are pale as the false dawn,
Whose statures are lean as the new moon.
Like unto a jar is the body,
And the soul in the jar
Is the silvery voice of the Fountain, 
Is the rose-scented breath of the Mountain,
         For your sake we have come
            In the shape of a jar from the Sea ; 
         For your sake we have come as Disgrace,
            But glory incarnate are we.
         For the sake of the world we dance
         O’er the flame, on the point of the lance.
            O, think us not mortal, for we
         Are the light on the foam of the sea. 
Of a truth, we are kin to the sun,
The infinite source of all splendors ;
We are one
With the world’s riddles and wonders.
But not of the world nor the sun is the breath
That lingers awhile in the regions of Death.
The dust on our sandals betrays us, we know—
We have travelled afar our devotion to show
To him who is waiting for us at the gate
Of the Garden of Union our longing to sate.
         We shall interpret the Truth, 
            We shall the Secret unveil ;
         For naked we come, like the dew,
            Like the zephyr, we come, and the gale :
         Naked, through thorn-bush and grass,
            We speak and we pass.
         Our garments were burned in the fire of the Mind,
         In the world where the Deaf still dispute with the 
                     Blind.
We are the Truth,
        And into the world
        From the Universe of Secrets we’re hurled.
We are the Truth,
        And into the skies
        From the Mists of Arcana we rise. 
                            II
In the light of the day, in the stars of the night we 
        behold
The face of the Master, the feet of the Pilgrim of old ; 
In the sigh of the wind and the voice of the thunder
        we hear
The plaint of the bard and the rhapsodic chant of the 
        seer.
       Without them, alas, we are dumb,
       Though not deaf to the flute and the drum.
         But the vision is true,
              Allahu, Allahu!
         They are garbed in blue,
              Allahu, Allahu!
         They are drenched with dew,
              Allahu, Allahu!
Hail, Sana’i the Moon of the Soul,
The Guide and the Road to the goal.
Hail, Attar the Vezier of Birds,
Who sing in his musk-scented words.
Hail, Arabi, the Tongue of the Truth,
The Eye of the Prophet, in sooth.
Hail, Rabi’a, the Heart of the Sphere,
Beloved of the bard and the seer ;
The Rosebud that rises to greet
The splendor beneath Allah’s feet. 
Hail, Gazzali, the Weaver of Light,
The maker of wings for the flight.
Hail, Hallaj, the Diver divine,
Whose pearls decorate every shrine, 
Whose blood was the pledge that his words,
I am Truth, shall fore’er be a sign.
To Jelal’ud-Din Rumi, all hail !
The Master who flung every veil
To the wind, who ne’er sober was seen,
Though ne’er to the tavern had been ; 
But ever—and often alone—
Was dancing before Allah’s throne.
Hail, Tabrizi, who nourished the Bard
With jasmine and myrtle and nard ;—
Who loafed and invited his soul
And would not write a word in his Scroll.
Hail, Fared, the love-stricken one,
The heart of the rhapsodic Sun ;
The soul of the Vineyard, the Press
That knew every vineyard’s caress :
The host of the Tavern divine—
The Saki, the Cup, and the Wine. 
        The vision is true,
           Allahu, Allahu!
        They are garbed in blue,
           Allahu, Allahu!
        They are drenched with dew,
           Allahu, Allahu!
        And casting the years from their folds and the
                  shame
        From their bosoms, they leap in the circle of flame ; 
        They leap, with a flash of their limbs, to the dance
        In the tender caress of the Beautiful’s glance.
For only in rapture the face of Belovéd is seen
Through the mask of the spheres and the veils of
        existence terrene ;
And only the slaves of Devotion and Love have the feet
That dare to approach the enravishing glow of the 
        Screen.
Yea, hither we come as the flame of his rapturous fire,
And to the music of rebec and flute, in the dance, we
        expire.
                            III
    Yea, Man is as near the Belovéd
    As far from the world he may be ;
    He is full of the beauty of Allah
    As he’s void of the Thou and the Me. 
    Life and the world we abandon 
    That the Life of the world we may see.
    O, come to the assembly of Lovers
    In the shade of the Tuba tree.
    O, come to the Banquet of Union
    And the taste of the ecstasy.
    O, come to the Tavern where nectar
    And wine are a-flow as the sea.
    For only the drunken are sober,
    And only the fettered are free.
Like the waves of the ocean we rise and we melt into 
         foam
That the Moon’s caravan might carry us back to our
         home. 
Likes the motes in the sun-beam we dance in the dawn’s
         disarray
That the sun might preserve us awhile from dust and
         decay ;
But the atoms of being, the motes in the Sun of his
         Love,
Are aflame with desire to be where no night is nor day.
Like a child in the cradle whose mother must rock it
         to sleep,
    We rock to and fro that the child of our heart might
         be still;
Like the lonely palm, when the whirlwinds over it 
         sweep,
    We sigh and we chafe in our chains, and we bow to
         his will. 
Like the bird in the cage who pecks at his sugar and
         sings,
So we, in the Cage of the world, to quiet our wings. 
But the vulgar will say that the dance of the palm ’s
         to the wind, 
And the bird to the sugar is singing—Alas! for the
         blind!
We come for their sake in the shape of a jar from the 
         Sea ;
We are filled with the water that heals ; and though
         sealed, we are free. 
        Nor Crescent Nor Cross we adore ;
        Nor Budha nor Christ we implore ;
        Nor Muslem nor Jew we abhor :
                We are free. 
        We are not of Iran or of Ind,
        We are not of Arabia or Sind :
                We are free. 
        We are not of the East or the West ;
        No boundaries exist in our breast :
                We are free. 
         We are not made of dust or of dew ;
         We are not of the earth or the blue :
                We are free.
        We are not wrought of fire or of foam ;
        Nor the sun nor the sea is our home ;
        Nor the angel our kin nor the gnome :
                We are free.
Yea, beyond all the moons and the suns and the stars,
         in a place
Where no shadow of horizon is, nor of darkness a 
         trace,
Where the Garden of God is a bloom on Love’s radiant
         strand,
There is our temple, our home, and our own native
         land. 
Yea, body and soul to the world and the sun do we 
         give,
And in the First Soul—the Soul of Belovéd—eternally
         live. 
                            IV
        Awake, O ye Pilgrims, awake !
          O Lovers, arise and prepare !
        The drum of departure we hear ;
          The Driver is come for the fare.
        The camels are ready ; their bells
          Are decking with silver the air.
        Awake, O ye Pilgrims, awake !
          O Lovers, arise and prepare!
        The nightingale sings on the branch
          To wake up the blossoms; the creek
        Whispers a word to the fern,
          Who follows, his favor to seek ;
        The tulip is begging to go
          With the zephyr who kisses her cheek ;
        The face of the Mist is a-glow,
          For Dawn mounts the Minaret to speak :
        Open the road is, and safe ;
          No gates and no sentries are there ;
        Awake, O ye Pilgrims, awake!
          O Lovers, arise and prepare!
        Each moment a spirit is sent
          With a message of mystery sealed ;
        Each moment a spirit goes forth
          That the mystery might be revealed.
        And whenever the Dawn opes his eyes,
          A blind one on the wayfare is healed ;
        Whenever a Lover appears,
          The Night drops her star-studded shield ;
        Whenever a Lover is slain,
          Blooms a flower in the world’s barley field.
        And always the pangs of departure
          Are wrought into torches that flare.
        Awake, O ye Pilgrims, awake!
          O Lovers, arise and prepare.
Ere the saki was born, ere the vineyard existed,
    The cup, bright and brimful, enchanted our eyne ;
Ere the tavern was built, we revelled and trysted
    With the loved One and drank to his beauty divine.
We drink till we wander away from Self and Desire,—
We drink till in drunkenness we, on his bosom, expire. 
We have known long ago all the raptures of madness ;
    All the raptures of burning from childhood we know ;
In our soul is the soul of the Mother of gladness ;
    In our heart is the heart of the Father of woe.
Transported and smitten, we wander with ne’er a 
         complaint ;
Our story entrances the sinner, enraptures the saint. 
Transported and smitten and drunk, we are thought
         to be mad ;
   Self abandoned, unity-seeking, we’re the puzzle of 
         fools ;
For the madman’s madness is varied in art, and the 
         sad
   Piety-monger tickles his heart while he drools.
O, mind not the springs of our robe, they were loosed
         in the revel ;—
They snapped when we drank with the saint and
         danced with the devil. 
There is nothing that we would conceal in the seeking ;
    Our love is the sun and our passion its flame ;
To dance-hall or tavern, we come not a-sneaking ;
    For the right and the wrong of the world are the
         same. 
And if you are a seeker, the blood of Hypocrisy shed ;
Nor be trammeled by Shame — take a poniard and cut
         off her head. 
        For your sake we have come
            In the shape of a jar from the Sea ;
        For your sake we have come as Disgrace.
            But glory incarnate are we.
        O think us not mortal, for we
            Are the light on the foam of the sea. 
Still higher our rank, though we come
    With the flute and drum. 
In the veils of the world do we come
    With the flute and the drum.
As vigilant warders we come
    With the flute and the drum.
To call you to the Tavern we come
    With the flute and the drum.
                            V
Perchance in our sleep we become unaware
    Of the circumstance strange of our birth ;
Perchance a hair
     Divides the heaven and the earth. 
But whether two worlds or a hundred, the loved One
           is all ;
    Only one do we seek, only One do we know,
        Only One do we hear, do we see, do we call.
We come as the heroes and slaves of the Mighty, the
           Dear ;
We come as the mind and the soul of the violet Sphere. 
What place have your meat and your bread 
Where we were first born, and first fed
   Through our eye and our ear ?
And now, without eyes we can see,
Without tongues we can speak,
   Without ears we can hear.
And when the clouds and the storms of the Mind
   Darken and shut out the skies,
We kindle the torch of the Heart,
   Which we give to the mighty and wise. 
For the heart is the bird of a world made holy by song ;
’T is the love-lorn and love-guided bulbul the owls
         among. 
And when it wings all exultant its way over mountain
         and moor,
It dreads nor the depths nor the heights nor the
         transcending lure.
The heart is a treasure of gold in the dust-pit of things;
’T is the rebec of love and of love forever it sing ;
’T is the pearl in the sea and the phare on the shore
         of the Mind ;
’T is the ear of the deaf and the all-seeing eye of the 
         blind. 
The heart is the maker of dreams, the alembic of
         power ;
’T is the gate to all beauty, the key to the ivory tower ;
’T is the crown of the Budha, the Christ, ’t is the
         sword of the Prophet ;
’T the flame in the temple of faith, and of reason,
         the flower. 
The heart is the last star that leaves in the wake of
         the Night,
And the first star that ushers Aurora’s pageant of light ;
’T is the first and the last ray of hope, the salvation
         of man ;
’T is our guide and our standard—the leader of our
         caravan. 
         Hearken! the voice of our leader
             In the dawn’s stillness and glow ;
         Allahu, Allahu! We’re ready ! 
             Sight-seeing with us, who will go? 
         The hour of departure is come,
             The caravan ’s moving. Woh ho!
         We are bound for a country of wonder.
             Sight-seeing with us, who will go?
         Wherever we stop on the way
             Is a feast for the heart, and a show ;
         Everywhere, too, is a tavern,
             Sight-seeing with us, who will go?
         He who has led us thus far
             Will lead us still further, we know :
         He opens to us every gate, 
             Sight-seeing with us, who will go?
         He is the magnet and we
             Are but pieces of steel: woh ho !
         Earthward the Magnet is moving!—
             Sight-seeing with us, who will go?
         Sweet scents from the curl of his tresses
             Are a-float on the breezes that blow
         From the radiant peaks of the world :—
             Sight-seeing with us, who will go?
         As we fix our amorous gaze
             Upon him more amorous we grow :
         He moves in a soul-witching maze :—
             Sight-seeing with us, who will go?
Come ! but come empty of purse and empty of hand ;
    Who travel with us shall not hunger or thirst, nor
             shall need ;
For the stores of the Master are open in every land,
    And his Stewards, the Earth and the Sun, his wishes
             exceed. 
         He is our need,
         Our staff and our creed ;
         Of our hope and despair,
         He’s the Sun and the Seed. 
Come, but come empty of heart and empty of mind ;
    Who travel with us shall not carry a thought or a 
         care ; 
For they who all things abandon, everything find, 
    And they who are drawn to the loved One, escape
         every snare. 
         He is our care,
         Our goal and our snare ;
         Of our grief and our joy, 
         The bequeather and heir. 
                            VI
Grape-juice must ferment in the jar,
           Ere it turns into wine ;
So the heart, in the jar of Desire,
           To sparkle and shine.
Like the face of the mirror that ’s clear
           Of image and form,
So the heart must be free of e’en the shadows
           To reflect the divine.
O Brothers, our words are the petals
           Of the rose that eternally blooms
In the thornless rose-bush of the Soul
           Which his image assumes. 
O Brothers, our word is the truth,
           Our standard the guide ;
No Sufis are speaking, but he 
           In whom all things abide. 
Yes, his parrots are we, sugar-chewing
           And repeating his words evermore,
While the habitants rude of the world
           Camel-like thistles devour. 
             Sugar-chewing we come for your sake :
             Awake, O ye Pilgrims, awake!
             The cypress that once graced the grove,
             Is a-float on the river of Love. 
O Lovers, the Veil of the Secret he rends,
And like light drops of water, he gently descends. 
He walks on the face of the turbulent sea,
Driving before him the waves to their lee ;
Like a shepherd he calls, and his flock turned to foam,
Scurries and scampers, impatient for home.
A moment, alas !   When his face is revealed,
All the wounds of the world are miraculously healed.
A moment, alas !   When his light disappears,
The world is submerged in an ocean of tears.
             We are the light that is spun
             For the firefly and the sun ;
             We are the thread in the pearls
             Of the sea and the tear.
Make use of our pearls, and our foam, and our fire ;
    For your sake we have come as Disgrace from the 
         Sea ;—
For your sake we have come in the flesh of Desire,
    But glory and beauty incarnate are we. 
We are the flowers in his Garden, the lights in his Hall,
The sign on his Portal, but he, he is all,—he is all !
             The banquet, the host, and the guest,—
             The seeker, the sought, and the quest,—
                   All three,
                   Is he.
             The given, the taker, the giver,—
             Love, the beloved, the lover,—
                   All three,
                   Is he.
And we, to rejoin him, like torrents, escape through the 
         hills ;
No fetters, no walls can restrain us, no welfare, no ills.
             Hope is sighing,
             Faith is crying,
             Creeds are dying,—
                   Allah, Allah!
             A clap of thunder
             Rents asunder
             Man’s little Wonder,—
                   Allah, Allah!
             Idols tumble
             In a jumble
             Temples crumble,—
                   Allah, Allah!
             Flames are sweeping ;
             Priests are reaping ;
             Kings are weeping,—
                   Allah, Allah!
             Ashes cumber
             Flame and ember,
             Who remember—
                   Allah, Allah!
             Night is crawling,
             Stars are falling,
             Souls are calling—
                   Allah, Allah!
             Orbs are winging, 
             Fire-bringing,
             And of him singing,—
                   Allah, Allah!
             Clove and nard, in
             His first garden,
             Wait his pardon,—
                   Allah, Allah!
             Every flower
             In his bower
             Is Love’s dower,—
                   Allah, Allah!
             His compassion
             And his passion
             Are our fashion,—
                   Allah, Allah!
Whirl, whirl, whirl,
Till the world is the size of a pearl.
Dance, dance, dance,
Till the world’s like the point of a lance. 
Soar, soar, soar,
Till the world is no more. "
july 28,"will i remember moments like this, standing on grass, the sky yawning over me
swahili beating out of speakers, dancing with a crowd of strangers
wondering how love has done nothing more to my body other than deform
the left side of my chest
will i remember brooklyn, the shocking beauty of a lighted train
running above ground and against the sky, before night wraps around fulton
an old woman kissing the bus driver’s cheek
green tennis balls poured over the courts on malcolm x
a little Black girl i do not know shouting adios amigo as she crosses the street
the smell of a roti shop, silk sliding on my arms
yellow kitchens, guavas and parathas
a white box fan whirring in our last summer"
The Fugitive,"         I saw Thee following me,
         I heard Thee calling me,
         I even felt Thine arrows in my tears ;
         I know Thou art shadowing me,
         And wilt yet, forestalling me,
         Whip out the vanities of all my years.
I ran and still I run away from Thee
Through maze and mirage of mortality ;—
Over the hot sands and the frozen lakes,
Across the sable wilderness that breaks
In fragrant moors, I ran to hills of dreams,
Up to the secret borderland that gleams
Eternally, casting its shafts of light,
From every incommunicable height,
Upon the spinning feet of humankind. 
O, how I leaped from peak to peak to find
The path to the azure dance-hall of the world,
Whose dome is gemmed, whose portals are empearled
With hearts that melt and crystallize and shine,—
With frozen music, frozen beads of wine,—
And whose laughter echoes through spinning
        spheres,
Where we were taught to dance in former years. 
Yea, I, who lit Thine altar, as a boy, 
And nursed in incense fumes my vision of joy, 
And like a roebuck leaped across the rills,
And danced like sparks of sunlight o’er the hills,
To be, at early morn and eventide,
The first of acolytes that served with pride
Thy venerable priests, alas! one day,
Casting my shame and piety aside,
I snuffed the candles out and walked away
Into the dazzling night of dance and song,
Into the temple of the merry throng. 
And ever since, a fugitive from Thee,
Shod with Thy lightning, chuckling oft with glee,
Unburdened and unfettered and undaunted,
With naught, not e’en my shamelessness to hide,  
And only by beguiling Beauty haunted,
I trod the path of demiurgic pride.
Yea, I was proud, when in the dawn’s desire
I could command the fruit of every tree,
The bloom of every garden, and the fire
Of every passion, every ecstacy
Upon my way. O pride of brawn and dare!
I’d shake the lustre from the stars and steal
The sap from the vines of June, and I would share
My booty with the comrade that would seal
His thieving faith with paeons to the deed
That knows nor law, nor moral code, nor creed. 
                            II
I ran and still I run away from Thee,
Past pyramids and labyrinths of reason,
Through gleaming forests, where the upas tree
Feeds both saint and sinner for a season.
And I danced in its lethal shades ; I climbed
Up to the highest fruit-concealing bough
That bends beneath a mocking wing ; I rhymed
My joy and pride ; and o’er the very brow
Of Death I leaped into the howling void,
Where the acrobats of Mind, with balance-pole
Of Logic in their hands, are ever employed
In scanning the dark canyons of the Soul.
And I was proud when on the tight rope I
Essayed my feet and fixed my giddy brain
Upon the universe ; whereat the sky
Was but a mute infinity of vain
Belief ; and every mystery divine.
A sea-washed, iridescent hollow shell
Upon the sands of faith : yea, every sign
Upon the road led to an empty well. 
And I was proud—O pride of intellect!—
That the nothingness of things I could detect. 
                            III
I ran and still I run away from Thee, 
Mistaking Thy compassion for Thine ire ;—
A rebel I, fantastically free,
A green-eyed flame of crepitating fire
Whipped by the winds of Circumstance, and yet
By Thee pursued and by Thy love beset. 
And why?— I oft pretend to know not why 
This fond solicitude. For what am I 
But a bubble of vanity, a human thing
Puffed with the vision of a loneliness
In which a pimpled Ego tries to sing
Of Self, alas! and spread its ebon wing.
But I remember still Thy first caress,
Which, in my infant vision I could feel
Even as the flowers, which Thy love reveal,
Even as the ocean in the Moon’s embrace,
Even as the sunrise that reflects Thy face. 
And this remembering, I hailed the soul,
Flaunting the sacred symbol of the goal
That shrines Thine image ; yea, and I was proud
That, rising over Self Thyself to find,
With Thine own godliness I was endowed, 
And yet I am but partially resigned . . . . .
O, spiritual pride! which would disguise 
The hollow heart of Holier-than-thou
In accent borrowed from the meek and wise,
I, too, have prated with a placid brow,
Though I, still casting shadows in the mire,
Was but a scarecrow in the vineyard of desire.
           I saw Thee following me,
         I heard Thee calling me,
         I even felt Thine arrows in my tears ;
         I know Thou art shadowing me,
         And wilt yet, forestalling me,
         Whip out the vanities of all my years."
The Sufi,"Lulled in the purple darkness is my soul,
Behind the curtain, Allah, of my sight,
Where recreative waves of wonder roll
From sad seas of color over dead seas of light :—
I close my eyes and lo, the laden Night
Stops at the ivory gate to pay thy toll
               To my soul.
And with it Wealth in Destitution’s van,
And power in the chariot of Dole,
And Fame upon the skeleton she stole
From Death, Ambition, too, amidst her clan,
Spurring her jaded nag :—the Caravan 
Of Life is at the gate to pay thy toll
               To my soul. 
They pass : I open my eyes : and as I try
To con the cruel pages of the scroll
Which Censure left in fragments at their goal,
Then suddenly, illumining the sky,
A form of grace and beauty I descry.
’T is Love, O Allah, come to pay thy toll
               To my soul. 
But once, while lingering in the doleful shades,
Among the fallen, wine-stained colonnades
Of what was once thy temple, where still troll,
With languid step, the spirit of pagan maids,
I saw thee, Allah, coming though the glades
With food of love and from thy scrip I stole
           A jasmine for my hungry soul."
Nocturne,"Upon the silent sea-swept land
     The dreams of night fall soft and gray,
          The waves fade on the jeweled sand
               Like some lost hope of yesterday.
The dreams of night fall soft and gray
     Upon the summer-colored seas,
          Like some lost hope of yesterday,
               The sea-mew’s song is on the breeze.
Upon the summer-colored seas
     Sails gleam and glimmer ghostly white,
          The sea-mew’s song is on the breeze
               Lost in the monotone of night.
Sails gleam and glimmer ghostly white,
     They come and slowly drift away,
          Lost in the monotone of night,
               Like visions of a summer-day.
They shift and slowly drift away
     Like lovers’ lays that wax and wane,
          The visions of a summer-day
               Whose dreams we ne’er will dream again.
Like lovers’ lays wax and wane
     The star dawn shifts from sail to sail,
          Like dreams we ne’er will dream again;
               The sea-mews follow on their trail.
The star dawn shifts from sail to sail,
     As they drift to the dim unknown,
          The sea-mews follow on their trail
               In quest of some dreamland zone.
In quest of some far dreamland zone,
     Of some far silent sea-swept land,
          They are lost in the dim unknown,
               Where waves fade on jeweled sand
                    And dreams of night fall soft and gray,
                         Like some lost hope of yesterday."
For Mauna a Wākea,"May 2020
It’s been 300 days since I first laid in your arms
First felt the chill of your kiss on my skin 
You brought me to the thin line between life and death
Between frostbite and heat exhaustion 
You taught me balance
Patience
Compassion
And when you stretched your arms around us
You taught us safety
What it meant to create security with our own bodies
Voices 
So for you 
I am every child who imagined someday you’d be free
I am every prayer laid at your feet
These days 
I am hundreds of miles away 
But you still visit me in my dreams
We share ceremony with Niolopua
And in that realm 
You keep all my secrets
All my fears 
All I am too afraid or ashamed to say out loud
For my fellow kiaʻi
It’s been 300 days since we marked the boundaries
Lined our jurisdictions with the trembling tenor of our collective voice
Since we began to feed each other
In food
In spirit
In care
For you
I am everything that cannot be broken
I am your first pinky promise
I am the incoming swell
I am every bit of love you taught me to lay at her feet
I am songs between stories, between tears
I am the water we fought to protect
That we shared 
Together
In the bitter cold of night
When we worried
No one else was coming"
from “What kind of times are these?”,"2

Virus sets fire after fire blazing the eco of the monarch trees kissing the clouds

The root of eco means home home once knew and grew alongside of ancient 

Sequoias who mediated sun and rain and song. 

But the children disappear somewhere 

And the forests forever scorched 

Virus asks what matters 

The children nick-named the cage—

The Freezer 

Lay on freezing floors 

Try to sleep  

On 

Concrete

When

The 

Children 

Cannot            be.          
 
Human?

It is not over. Border Control pulled the children out of their parents’ arms.  
Children stolen for private prisons to boom.   Seven Indigenous children 
died inside the prisons.  ACLU reunited a few families.  It is not over.  
The parents are looking for them, year after year looking for them. 
Who counts the missing?  Reporters fail to find a paper-trail.    
No.  database.  to count the Disappeared in America.  
Yesterday’s news.  No longer newsworthy.  
But they have stories—real cliffhangers.  
The child no longer remembers her eyes. 
Not even grandmother’s or grandfather’s, 
or big sister’s or brother’s, or cousin’s.
Lungs of sorrow catch the mourning 
molecules fueling Virus.

The children laugh at us. The children hear what we will not. 
They ask me. Auntie, you can’t hear that? What about now? Now?  
Can you hear the fiesta near those old woods by the old meeting house? 
We can hear those ghosts singing and dancing for—Maria, 
the great great niece of Uncle Lucas. She is about to walk.  
Graduating with Honors from UC Hastings College of Law 
in the heart of the Tenderloin in Immigration Law.  
Her parents lived to see her walk.  
Listen to her words.  
Forty years ago her parents crossed the Rio Grande before sunrise 
but in those days—in those days on the side of mercy—the others knew
brought the people water, food, blankets and a change of clothes.
           
What if our children made it to their thirteenth birthday?   
Were they not born to dream? A lawyer or a judge or a chef, or a poet.  
The children could have dreamed to celebrate with Maria.  
To see her walk so the ancestors could live.
Maybe the children dreamed the old revolutionary road 
unblocking the path to that old meeting house 
in the woods. There once was a path 
to make it, to give back.  "
Love in a Time of Covid-19,"a variant of Pablo Neruda’s Sonnet XVII
I don’t love you as if you were penicillin, 
insulin, or chemotherapy drugs that treat cancer,
I love you as one loves the sickest patient:
terminally, between the diagnosis and the death. 
I love you as one loves new vaccines frozen 
within the lab, poised to stimulate our antibodies,
and thanks to your love, the immunity that protects 
me from disease will respond strongly in my cells.
I love you without knowing how or when this pandemic 
will end. I love you carefully, with double masking. 
I love you like this because we can’t quarantine 
forever in the shelter of social distancing, 
so close that your viral load is mine,
so close that your curve rises with my cough."
Remembering,"How you bowed
to the new moon
of every month
Morning brings
the smell of rain
and incense burning
Traveler’s palm
waves at 
the top of the hill
Each spring
we returned to the city
where you were born
What happened
to the pocket watch
from another century
And what became of
the penknife used
to sharpen the pencils
The trees you 
first planted
are all gone now
Reading by
the glowworm light
of a kerosene lamp
The north side of the house
stays cool while the south side
burns with the sun
Not content to love
the singing thrush you
call it by another name
The dogs are silent 
even though
the moon is full
Remembering
when we 
were one"
Message to My Sistah,"I just did
wat I talked about doing
wen we wuz visiting
on da smartphone.
  You told me
wat you wuz eating 
foa breakfast da adah day
and it kinnah inspired me.
  Da last time
I ate French Toast
wuz wen I wuz living
in Hawaiʻi years ago.
  So I wen actually
make some dis morning
and I topped 
da tasty slices off 
wit some kinamona
and some Ohio maple syrup.
  I’m eating right now
while I’m tinking 
about you
and looking at wun picture
of our parents 
on my living room tabletop.
  It’s just like
I’m in da yellow kitchen
up in Wahiawa Heights
at da old house.
  Da hoʻomanaʻo is ʻono.
Da French Toast
is pretty good too."
Badruddin,"Seek what you shall e’er possess,
O Badruddin,
Although it be a will-o’-the-wisp
Of the Unseen,
Which you may never behold
Until my suns and satellites are cold.
And in the seeking you shall find
The hidden jewels of the soul and mind ;
And every jewel shall reveal
Things divine
Even in a Sufi’s logic wheel,
Yea, even in the lowing kine.
The eyewash, O lone Badruddin, I bring
Is of the first dews of the first-born spring.
Apply it and behold!
Your dog-bitten sandals are transformed into gold ;
Your staff, sand-eaten and far-wandering,
Is bursting into foliage, blossoming.
Bearing fruits of wondrous lush and glow ;
And underneath the heavy-laden tree
A maid, whose face dispels all human woe,
Is cooking sesame for you and me.
  Cast off the garments of the world
And wear the sacred shades,
Whose color of contentment never fades,
And sit beside me with the golden fawn,
Whose name is Eternal Dawn.
  O thou Beloved, every word of thine
Is like a draught of purple wine ;
Every syllable
Is like the singing of the bulbul.
More potent are they than the magic lore
Which to the blind the sight restore,
As now to one, who through a pilgrim old,
Is but an infant in the cradle of love.
Yea, O thou incomparably Sweet,
Thy words are to mine eyes a heating kohl,
Musk to my nostrils, balm to my soul,
Strengthening ointments to my feet.
And what, in the stores and treasures of the world,
Is equal unto this?
Wealth and Beauty, Fame and Power,
They are but mirages in the boundless waste
That separates me from thee—for an hour.
  Once I tarried at a Well in an Oasis fair
But in the cup I lifted to my lips
I saw the image of thy wrath
And my despair :—
I dashed against a rock the common clay
And hastened away.
  Now, O thou Beloved, I come to thee :
With thy beauty drunk and dumb ;
Burdened with thy wealth, and lame ;
Ushered by thy liveried Fame ;
In thy glory garbed I come.
But I tremble at thy threshold lest the thorns in my feet
The story of my sacrifice repeat ;
I tremble at thy threshold lest the flowers of my heart
Betray the painted lips of conscious art ;
I tremble at thy threshold lest the eyes
That long have sought to behold but once thy face,
Deserve not even thy shadow to embrace."

"[The city breaks in houses to the sea, uneasy with waves,]","The city breaks in houses to the sea, uneasy with waves,
And the lonely sun clashes like brass cymbals.
In the streets truck-horses, muscles sliding under the steaming hides,
Pound the sparks flying about their hooves;
And fires, those gorgeous beasts, squirm in the furnaces,
Under the looms weaving us.
At evening by cellars cold with air of rivers at night,
We, whose lives are only a few words,
Watch the young moon leaning over the baby at her breast
And the stars small to our littleness.
The slender trees stand alone in the fields
Between the roofs of the far town
And the wood far away like a low hill.
In the vast open
The birds are faintly overheard."
Apostrophe,"Ocean, every so often, a kitchen tile or child’s toy 
rises from you, years after the hurricane’s passed. 
This time, the disaster was somewhere else. 
The disaster was always somewhere else, until it wasn’t. 
Punctuation of the morning after: comma between red sky
and sailors’ warning; white space where a storm cloud lowers. 
Where the bay breaks away, the sentence ends: a waning
crescent of peninsula, barely visible 
but for the broken buildings, the ambulance lights. 
Ocean, even now, even shaken, you hold the memory 
of words, of worlds that failed slowly, then all at once. A
flotilla of gulls falls onto you, mourners draped in slate."
Good Grief,"after the 2021 Texas Winter Storm
I’ll admit that I’ve never thought about frostbite.
Trauma of the blood, a thing to be avoided when heat goes out for an entire state.
I don’t know where to place this grief, this sweltering state freezing, politicians breezing over to a country that doesn’t have tissue choked out by its winter yet.
The sky can only do what it does.
The American government can only do what systems driven by green paper, violence & ache can do.
The trees bloom over dead bodies, missing.
The sound of hands rubbing, engines purring, hopes that gas lights or chafing or the rapture won’t come first may quiver in my blood forever.
I am Black but maybe I am doomed.
Memory flashes like a computer screen; I see the zoom link expand. Colleagues process whatever failure number of a thousand this was this year and I can only remember white.
Six inches deep, sunken into my boots all over.
The timeline of friends stranded, impending doom of electricity shutting off, water pressure slipping into nothing every hour, pipes bursting on top of all that white.
I haven’t recovered from seeing things that too-closely resemble holes in a graveyard.  
I haven’t forgotten the project is due in 2 weeks.
My therapist says take it easy as if capitalism is listening. As if the body will ever forget what it is given.
I am Black which is history, personified.
I used to listen to Pilot Jones fondly. With all this frostbite on my fingers, I’m not sure if I can type.
I cannot finish another sentence on unity.
What is unified about ERCOT letting us freeze? Knowing how to fix the problem & not doing it; how does that form a Kumbaya circle?
If I made art about every pain I’ve felt unjustly, I would be swimming in accolades for great American books.
I would take back every word I’ve written if it ended this.
America is the worst group project.
I’m writing a great American poem about suffering.
How much is going without food that isn’t canned for a week worth?
The absence of snow feels like betrayal. My memory mixes with American delusion. 
I can’t believe half the things that I’ve been through.
Ice cold, baby, I told you; I’m ice cold.
Who said it first, Frank Ocean or Christopher Columbus?
I’ve never been taught how to adequately mourn the nights spent bitching about a brisk wind; the night we almost got stranded trying to get to J before the cold swallowed them whole.
I want to give everything I’ve been handed a good cry. Red skin & chapped lips deserve it.  
Good grief, what has Texas done to me.
An article features a person walking past tents near I-35. 
I can’t cry about the body but I feel it.
A highway splits a nation from its promise to be one.
Everything feels blurry and the palm trees have died.
Everything transported here withers away eventually.
6 months later and I haven’t been able to shovel out my sadness.
A news report said that it’s safe to go back to work. & I listen, because what else can you do in 6 inches of white.
The snow melted and I still feel frostbitten.
There are no heroes in a freeze-frame changing nothing.
I pose begrudgingly. Say cheese & then write this.
I’m not a survivor; just still breathing.
I remember grief, love’s grand finale.
What else do we have if not the memory of life before this?
I cannot tell you how many lives I’ve lost to mourning, but I can tell you that the sky does what it does.
Let’s go for a walk & touch the trees that survived like us.
Let’s write a future more joyful & less inevitable in segments of leaves.
Anything we dream will be better than this."
I Suffer a Phobia Called Hope,"translated from the Arabic by Fady Joudah
Each time I hear that word
I recall the disappointments
that were committed in its name:
the children who don’t return,
the ailments that are never cured,
the memory that’s never senile,
all of them hope crushed
beneath its wings as I smash
this mosquito on my daughter’s head.

*
The grieving have only the unknown.
It’s their only staple and inheritance.
Pain has no logic. All things redeem
the grieving except your rational questions.
*
I wish that no one goes
and no one comes.
All going is a stroke of myth
and each return
a punctured lung."
The United States of Montessori,"for Oray
We sat Indian style, & sang our pledge
to Audubon, painted birds on every wall,
& heard mirage when our teachers said
mural. We stole soccer balls from French
exchange, spiked them on the walkway
& yelled touchdown. My friend, where
are you now? We tripped over tree roots
racing to the playground, walked the sea
of wood chips to the plastic ship’s eye
& wheel. We bartered Super Donuts for
extra cartons of chocolate milk, played
duck, duck, duck, duucck, duuuuccckkk
goose. We vamoosed around a sunken
circle of laughter. We were hedgehogs,
were road runners & sombrero mice.
We were bullets, the Flash & every Green
Lantern; the Black ones, the White ones,
the alien ones too."
Praise poem,"The dog through the window walks unashamed,
moving to consume the love nearest by.
Pushing their head infinitely to the stranger,
not fearing the talking sun. A flea walks up
to my cup and floats as if on ice
hovering above, on, above. I push it away,
and it flickers into the air. Just yesterday, I saw
a woman give a visitor a handful of fruit.
Going into her kitchen, there were persimmons
and tangerines on the counter, lemons tarrying on the floor,
nothing living in the rightful container.
Their hands were so heavy they had to push them together
to hold it all. The window dog is much like
the Tinder dogs is much like a screen playing fire.
I know the men are good because they are near
the dogs. I know the fire is good
because I’ve felt alone without.
The day I moved to LA I saved the plane ticket from home.
It’s sentimental to imagine another monochromatic lifetime.
Still, I have memory to place her foothold in meaning.
Moten says the settler is not someone who goes to someplace
that’s not their own the settler is someone who goes someplace
and tries to make it their own. If ownership, then reconstructive
surgery. The store I’m in, or this world, keeps asking
if I want my receipt. A prescient child’s hand
holding an acorn. I have no need for innocence.
It’s becoming less hard to imagine the dignity
of standing up and leaving a seat empty for someone new."
To Abu’l-Ala,"In thy melancholy’s pensive Fancy
    Wisdom rolled its beauteous stars and moons,
Just as in my riotings of pleasure
    Thy lone midnights roll into my noons.
Abu’l-Ala, in thy glorious darkness
    Didst thou not remember unborn me?
In thy journey to the farthest planets
    Didst thou not a burdened shadow see?
Ay, behind the portals of Saturnus
    Secretly the cup to thee I passed;
Long, long after this cup thou returnest
    Filled with gems of fancy and recast.
In thy Prison a thousand Yamen weapons
    Thou didst forge for the oppressed and weak:
In my attic a thousand Beauty roses
    I pluck for thee from a Yankee cheek."
In Memory of E. M. EL—K.,"When my parched lips upon thy princely brow,
    Placid as tropic mead, as glacier cold,
Imprinted a last farewell, where wert thou­—
    Where didst thy soul its loveliness unfold?
Can’t be that in some undiscovered sphere
    The Muses sing their souls to thine in bliss?
Can’t be that when I kiss thy forehead here
    A thousand angels echo there my kiss?
What is this mask, where is the soul, O where,
    And from these eyes, O God, where went the light?
My silence cries within me in despair,
    My reason’s sinking in this sea of Night.
Esau, I am beside thee now alone,
    I dare not weep, I dare not even breathe;
But through the stillness something hither blown
    Makes of thine amber locks a golden wreath.
Life flutters in thy hair as in mine eyes;
    Death can not choke the breeze that whispers there
A word of hope; beneath my breath will rise
    A hair with God eternity to share
The noon and eve of Life thou didst not see,
    But in its Dawn thou didst anticipate
What jealous Night would not permit to be,
    What pain and suffering never could abate.
Shall I strew on thee faded blossoms, Brother,
    Or fiery buds consumed by their own flame,
Or myrrh and myrtle from our Mountain-mother,
    Or golden rods that whispered oft thy name?
Or, at the shrine of Liberty and Love,
    Where thou didst worship ardently and die,
Shall I now join the gods come from above
    With thy sweet songs this shrine to beautify?
Ye sapling-pines of star-kissed Lebanon,
    Ye cedars laden with a wealth of years,
Send with the mist of dawn and the rising sun
    Your garlands, and your incense, and your tears."
Allah Wa Ana,"Though I’m God, thou art man, we are one,
    We are all and we shall ever be;
Though the light of my sky thou didst shun,
Thou shalt love me ere thy course is run,
    As forever I live loving thee.
Thou art mine, I am thine and the fire
    Of my breath all thy regions shall warm,
Ere the life in thy soil shall expire,
Ere the seeds of thy basest desire
    From their prison break out and take form.
Thou wilt doubt and deny me forsooth
    And rejoice in thy vanity’s power;
Thou wilt die on the breast of my truth,
In the end thou wilt laugh at thy youth,
    And its wine although old will be sour.
I was with thee when thou didst deny,
    As I am with thy mother at prayer;
I was with thee when thou didst defy
My hell and my earth and my sky,
    And I love non the less those that dare.
In the yogi’s pagoda I am;
    In the fire of the magi I was;
To the sons of Abraheem and Sham
And their foes and to thee I undam
    All the banks of my veins on the cross.
Through the spheres and the primitive throngs
    I came down and I struggled with thee;
Through the ages I sing in thy songs,
But I leave thee to rise on thy wrongs;––
    Thou shalt rise and thou shalt live in me."
Onward Keep,"Onward keep! Forget the self that cried:
     “This world’s a forest choked with ice and
           snow;
No spark of fire through it can ever ride,
    No human flame in it can ever glow.”
And keeping onward, now, I find
    The golden leaves of yesterday
All safely hidden from the wind
    Beneath the snow that melts away,
And on the shivering boughs
    New leaves and tender sprout;
They crown the winter’s brows,
    And laugh away his doubt.
And laugh away his doubt.
               And in the brook
                   The echoes of
               What I forsook––
                   What I did love.
               And the frost
                  ’Neath the breath
               Of me must
                    Welcome death;
               And the heat
                    Left behind
               Guides the feet
                    Of the blind.
               Onward keep;
               Laugh and weep;
                    Pain and joy
               Hide and peep.
                    Rise and fall––
               Fall and rise;
                    This is all––
               This is wise."
Near the Cascades,"            Hold back thy lips, I pray;
             Just let me rest this way;
            My soul is in the spray
Arising from the silvery cascades murmuring
            farewell to the day.
            Thy kisses ’neath a sigh
            Of mine extinguished lie;
            O friend, I choke, I die:
Pray, let me raise my head to see the parting
            Light, the vivid sky,
            If every kiss of thine
            Is safety kept with mine
            For one for whom I pine,
Wouldst thou, contented with the taking, call my
            love a love divine?
            Ay, and for every tear
            Thou sheddest when I’m near
            I shed a score to hear
Her echo my desire’s sigh, albeit she is not thy
            peer.
            If I were but a reed,
            Or but a fern or weed,
            This would not be my creed;
But prick thou these cold slips and all the roots
            of me in heaven will bleed.
            Thy burning breath is creeping
            All over me; ’t is leaping
            Into my bones and sweeping
Their ashes out, up and into mine eyes, alas!
            the awful reaping.
            No longer do I fear,
            Nor see, nor feel, nor hear;
            No longer am I near;
If thou wilt quench thy flame, kiss now the lips
            that were to thee so dear.
            As well kiss thou the grass
            On which I lay, alas!
            Like me, thou too wilt pass;
One kiss will turn thy lips to ashes and one tear,
            thine eyes to glass.
            Beneath this hemlock tree
            A clod I leave to thee;
            But over land and sea
My soul is rising, rising, rising, searching for the
            gods that be.
            But gods have lived, and lied,
            And loved, and fell, and died;
            And like me too they cried
For mercy at the snow white feet of Beauty’s
            daughter,
            Beauty’s bride.
            And when from Beauty’s spell
            Her soul is free, she’ll dwell
            In mine, the storm to quell;
In mine she’ll rise to realms of bliss, or swiftly
            whirl into the deepest hell."
Written After Reading King Lear,"Long is his course, O master of our woes,
And joys, and tears, our passions and desires,
In nature’s school—in hell-begotten fires;
Dread is the agony and fell the throes
Which with the Night and Storm he undergoes,
While Treason in his robes herself attires,
And Love beneath adultery’s sheet expires,
And mocked Sincerity sincerer grows.
To vie with wailing winds and weeping clouds
And valleys shrieking in the fangs of storms,
This Human Hurricane thou didst create;
But just as soon as Death this horror shrouds,
I hear the distant cry of fiery forms,
Ay, and the creaking of hell’s deepest gate."
"O, Give Me Strength to Take","Thy love’s as tender as the drooping rose that
          sadly says to earth:
“No more have I the strength to take what
          thou giv’st me;”
But unlike her, alas, thy love’s complaint of
          dearth:
“Thou hast no strength to give what I demand
          of thee.”
Thy love hath heard the many whispered prom-
          ises of every soul;
His birth methinks is nigh coeval with the
          birth of time:
He lives in death throughout the ages, and his
          goal
Is hidden in the faded flowers from every
          clime.
His soul is deeper than the sea and deepest cav-
          erns in its bed;
’T is higher than the highest sky above our
          own;
’T is purer than the morning dew a-dripping
          from the salvias red;
’T is mightier than the four winds, blowing
          from every zone.
This love hath offered me the keys of all his halls
          and towers,
And to my heart with clinging kisses he ap-
          pealed;
But, ah, forgive me God! must I the sweetest
          flowers
Refuse because they do not grow in Beauty’s
          field?"
Repentance,"When tears wash tears and soul upon soul leaps,
    When clasped in arms of anguish and of pain,
When love beneath the feet of passion creeps,
    Ah me, what do we gain?
When we our rosy bower to demons lease,
    When Life’s most tender strains by shrieks are slain,
When strife invades our quietude and peace,
    Ah me, what do we gain?
When we allow the herbs of hate to sprout,
    When weeds of jealousy the lily stain,
When pearls of faith are crushed by stones of doubt,
    Ah me, what do we gain?
When night creeps on us in the light of day,
    When we nepenthes of good cheer disdain,
When on the throne of courage sits dismay,
    Ah me, what do we gain?
When sweetness, goodness, kindness all have died,
    When naught but broken, bleeding hearts remain,
When rough- shod o’er our better self we ride,
    Ah me, what do we gain?"
It was All for Him,"I strolled upon the Brooklyn Bridge one day,           
              Beneath the storm;
None but a lad in rags upon the way
I saw;––there on a bench he lay
              Heedless of form.
He seemingly was reading what the Shower
   Was publishing upon the Bridge and down
          the Bay;
Yet he was writing, writing at this hour,–––
   Writing in a careless sort of way.
Upon a pad he scribbled and as fast the rain
   Retouched, effaced, corrected and revised.
Was he recording Nature’s solemn strain,
   Or sketching choristers therein disguised?
Whatever it be, I found myself quite by his side;
   My nod and smile he pocketed and wrote
         again;
“Read me your drizzling stuff,” I said, and he
         replied:
“I’ve written a check in payment for this
         shower of rain.”"
Midnight Mood,"There's one upon whose youthful breast I fain would die: 
     My soul upon her lingering lips through mine I'd pour
     In torrents that would reach and thrill Love's every shore—
In floods that drown the earth and rise to drown the sky. 
But how can I? Alas, the leaves must shield the flower, 
    And silent see her proferring to the butterfly
    Her cheeks, her honeyed lips, her soul,—O how can I?
In all the worlds, to change my being, is there no power? 
How oft I rise at night to probe the human laws, 
    My beating temples all my waking hours recording! 
    And nor solution, nor repose my task affording,—
How oft my carnal silence cries for the bliss that was! 
The bliss that generous nature gives, that man denies—
   A bliss that's chained in idle words and damned codes
   And creeds and customs creeping in their dark abodes—
The bliss that's lost within an endless maze of lies. 
Pray, tell me, must the North Wind blow and sweep by rule? 
    Must he the virgin ponds and springs and rills avoid? 
    See how the ocean, panting, rising, overjoyed, 
Holds out her arms to him,—why not the limpid pool? 
And thou, O human Ocean,—would that I could give 
   In equal measure, when beneath me thou art parting! 
   O, generous, fiery soul, in love though I am wanting, 
My flesh, within thy passion's hearth, will glow and live. 
Thou art the twilight; I'm the dawn; yet we shall meet 
   And flood the firmament with fire and rainbow beauty. 
   No unfed sun or moon shall rob us of our booty, 
And if the gods should frown,—is not the rebellion sweet? 
But ah, live Twilight! why cannot the Dawn be true? 
   Why can't I quaff from thy sad lips, as thou, from mine? 
   Why can't this heart, forgetting once, as well be thine? 
How can I my most holy passion tame, subdue? 
That youthful breast, imprisoned, I see through thine own; 
    Those Eastern eyes cannot be hidden by thy flame; 
    That form, as I am in thine arms—O, do not blame—
In mine I fancy,—let me die in shame alone! 
   "
The Sister of Death,"Ah, talk to me of something else, I pray;
I’m weary of the dreams that bring nor sleep,
Nor rest, nor love, nor something from the deep,
Where buried are the gods of yesterday;
Ah, talk to me of Death that takes away
My little sorrows, as they hide and peep,
My little joys, as they disport and leap,
My little vanities, my budless May.
The burden of my virtues and my sins,
The burden of authority that grins
at every effort, ah, the burden kills;
I know that Death a Sister hath, but where,
Where can I find thee, Love, when shall I share
The sweetness of the silence of the hills?"
A Bed of Flame,"I saw one day on the horizon grey,
      As with my load I wandered near the sea,
            A whiff of smoke embrace the sleeping sun;
            And just as their enchantment had begun,
      A lonely cloud that roved above the lea
Passed by their couch and hid them from the day.
I saw this and my soul, long silent, cried:
      “Would that I were the whiff of smoke
            Now sleeping with the sun!
In beds of flame, how often was I tried,—
      How often have I ’neath the stroke
            Of God or Satan shone!”"
"O, Sweet Sometime","O, sweet Sometime, the gardens bloom the while I wait;
Each moment melts a tear of joy before thy gate;
It is thy pleasure that I burn,—it is my fate,
O, sweet Sometime!
O, when the moment in this interval is born,
When through this sleeping splendor breaks the lingering morn,
And when thy sensual silence laughs my noise to scorn—
O, sweet Sometime!
Spare me the vacant moment yet,—O just awhile;
Expectancy, thy sweetest daughter, will beguile
My yearning hours; the shades reflected by her smile
Are now my haunts, O sweet Sometime.
The waiting while, O sweet Sometime, I can enjoy;
Thy heralding shadows every beating pang destroy,
And with their breath of musk and myrrh my soul they cloy,
O, sweet Sometime!
I tremble, I forget, I throb when once I hear
The dying interval announcing thou are near;
A touch, a groan, a kiss and thou wilt disappear,
With bitten lip, O, sweet Sometime!
And then the memory—O, how it will oppress!
Far sweeter is Expectancy—ah, let me press
The vigor from her limbs to mind; I’ll yet caress
The waiting while, O, sweet Sometime!"
The 'Flatiron' and the Ruins of Palmyra,"To the Ruins of Palmyra this the “Flatiron” addrest:
     “Did you ever in your glory
Dream of looking up to see my crest?”
To the “Flatiron” the Ruins thus replied across the sea:
      “We were like thee yesterday,
To-morrow thou wilt like us be.”"
In The Meadow,"The shadow of thy curls I see
      Upon thy lovely face;
And just a little wish is mine—
      The shadow to embrace.
On thy black and silken tresses,
      Ah, one longs to feast the sight;
But the shadows of their beauty,
      Hanging on thy cheeks of light,
From my lips, exact a tribute,
      Which I pay here in this meadow:
Blush not, my most winsome maiden;
      I have only kissed the shadow."
The First and Last,"O kiss me now; the end is near
The bright beginning; kiss me, dear.
I would not that thou shouldn’t one day
In bitter thought remembering say:
“When in the high tide of our bliss
Upon these lips I slew the kiss
That should have lived.”
                                            The kiss I fear—
The poison, ah, the lie, my dear.
Fear not; O kiss me whilst I can’t
Refuse; am I to-morrow thine?
Wilt thou be near me when I pant?

I shall not go; thou wilt not pine.
Sweet thoughts!—Alas, the first, the last!

Nay, nay! I cling to thee: the past
Is dying in the lap of night
In which our star is shining bright.
The fingers in the shadow, there!
What are they weaving? Look, a shroud!
Come, purse thy lips; do no despair;
Take hold my hand and speak aloud.
No, no! For whom that shroud, for whom?
Not for our love—not for our joy?
Then seal thou with thy lips my doom,
Ay, with a kiss this life destroy!"
A Better Woe,"Of all my desert days
Thou art the only one
Upon whose sandy face
A strip of pleasure’s foliage trembling grows;
Of all the winding ways,
Which with my rapture shone
But one can I retrace,
And there the barren breast of beauty glows.
Of all the dread desires,
That beat within me still,
One shakes the sacred fear
And hurls me into the arms of her below;
But oh, how life suspires—
How soon after the thrill
Of joy I shudder, I hear
My murmuring soul pine for a better woe."
Disarmed Desire,"O, how the light drifts from the hemlock grove,
How in the night disarmed Desires do rove!
A sister to the dumb hydrangea thou,
A mystery born of the Then and Now.
The color on thy clouded face—ah me!
Is’t from the embers that still burn in thee?
Has not the forge of suffering robbed thee of
The flame with which weak mortals feed their love?
Wilt thou, no longer fancying the light,
Conjure a virgin flame from the darkest night?
And feed it with the salvias of a soul,
That would, but yet—alas! she seeks the Whole.
The hand that broke the screen, the hearth that lied,—
Where are they? Come, the path of truth is wide.
The silvery cataracts of roaring rills
Meander in the shadows of the hills;
And their bass music,—does it not arise
From that descent that leads up to the skies?
O how disarmed Desire uprises, how—
Does not the darkness crown the Lightning’s brow?
Yet how I wish, yet how I shrink, when I
Behold thee—ah, she’s ever in mine eye!
If thy pink, blue and golden hues disclose
The secret, might not that undo the rose?
Thou sister to the dumb hydrangea, when
Will all thy sombre musings rise again?
O, how the light drifts from the hemlock grove,
How in the night disarmed Desires do rove!"
A Serenade,"                               I

The moon hath said her sad good-bye, 
    My sleeping queen; 
And all the stars are wondering why
    Thou art unseen. 
Behold! abashed, they take to flight, 
As through the casement breaks thy light. 
                Arise, my dawn, arise! 
                Arise, my queen serene! 

                               II

The field of heaven is all thine own, 
    my peerless star, 
Just as my heart is thine alone, 
     Be near or far. 
So let thy face adorn the night. 
And flood it with thy dazzling light. 
                 Arise, my queen, arise! 
                 Arise, to my guitar! 

                               III 

The vaults above all vacant seem, 
     My sweetest flower; 
And for thy scent, the cherubim
     Long at this hour. 
A moment from thy sweet dream part.
Though in that dream be wove my heart. 
                Arise, my queen, arise! 
                Let fall thy perfume shower. "
Resurrection,"The ghost of Winter stalks amidst the boughs
Of Spring and drags along his icy shroud;
The corn flowers and the wheat, with broken vows,
Are now beneath the storm untimely bowed.
O Winter, thou wert buried on the hills;
Thine epitaph was written with melted snow;
Thy skeleton is in the barren rills,
Where once thy silvery life-blood used to flow.
Why visits the glimpses of the sun
So soon, what message bring’st thou from the dead?
Why rudely interrupt the children’s fun
And havoc among the Guests of Summer spread?
Behold, the branches shiver, the blossoms fall;
The lilac in the leaves a shelter seeks;
Thy savage winds the Queen of May appal,—
They pale with summer’s dust her rosy cheeks.
Withhold the solemn music of thy gale
Until the golden notes of Spring are spun;
The opera in the trees is but begun,
O, drown it not with thy benighted wail.
For thee May’s winged madonnas will not sing,
Nor in thy presence will they now appear:
Begone, that their sweet voices may we hear—
Begone, the world to-day belongs to Spring."
Nectar and Blood,"                        I
If I should worship at thine ancient shrine,
Where thy good sons, incensed by love of war,
Now clamor, as their fathers did of yore—
If I should sacrifice what is not mine,
Nor any living god’s, nor even thine—
If for the sake of honor I must pour
This cup of life upon thy barren shore,
How will it fare then with my love divine?

No! let thy sons go forth to burn and slay:
Let them for love of thee and glory smear
And tear the love of all that’s pure and dear;
Let them this loveless love in rage display;
I can not join them; no, I can not cheer
As they beneath my window pass to-day.
                        II
What care I for the tears the maudlin crowd
Sheds o’er my bier—for praise of Church and State—
For glory that remains within the gate
Of worldly things—for men’s esteem avowed—
For freedom that is not with love endowed—
For fame that lingers oft and comes too late,
When these the sorrow of my love create
And haunt her with the shadow of my shroud?

How cowardly, self-centered have I grown—
How dead to true and noble feelings all?
Why not, when they the human soul enthrall—
Why not, when they the beast in man enthrone?
I cling to love, and with love I will fall,
Unwept, unsung, unhonored and unknown.
                        III
What will these kings and war-lords of the land
And all their ministers of murder fell
Do with their arms and fleets—all tools of hell—
If every son of man resolve to stand
A-wielding, king-like, in his home the wand,
Beside the ones he loves and honors well?
Can force this gentle host of peace compel,
When loving hearts their amber wings expand?

O love, though hounded, outlawed we may be—
Though Slander, dagger-drawn, be on our trail—
Though Hatred with her hydra tongues should rail
At us, and though left sinking in the sea
Of ostracism, ay, never will I quail,
But will now and forever cling to thee."
Adele,"Adele! a name that kindled in the breast
Of France’s first-born of the fairest Muse
A flame in which a thousand colors fuse
And shame the April rainbows of the West;
But I can only stand upon the crest
Of Song’s most sacred Mount and bring excuse
That I have begged, and since the gods refuse,
I steal, and with the theft I thee invest,
A Sun or Moon of Song for all my oceans
Of purest love, an ornament at best,—
A bunch of stars—a wreath for my emotions;
But if the gods with sisters dear are blest,
To me they all must come in joy or sorrow,
From me they all must steal, or beg, or borrow."

Fardi Wa Nafli,"This was written in the hospital where Mr. Rihani’s sister suffered for more than two years. She was taken sick not long before the day appointed for her wedding.
                                    I
“Here she is: O take her not away so soon!
    ⁠Spare her youth—the fatal cup from her withhold!
Let her groan within my arms in life’s forenoon;
    ⁠Let me still my soul within her eyes unfold.”
God of Love! my faith in thee is not yet gray:
    ⁠Grant that she may walk again,
    ⁠Free from suffering and pain—
Give her life to see the altar’s light one day.
                                    II
In the night, before the day that never came,
⁠    On the way with poppies and gardenias strewn,
With her music and her torch’s holy flame,
    ⁠She was struck and never since saw sun or moon.
God of Light! refuse her not another ray:
⁠    Her bridal garment joins with me
⁠    In beseeching, begging thee—
Give her life to see the altar’s light one day.
                                    III
All the sorrow earth contains I can support,
⁠    All the agony and pain I can endure;
Years of misery will seem surprising short,
    ⁠If to me thou leav’st her, though without a cure.
All my dreams before thy throne, O God, I slay;
    ⁠These my offerings let be,
    ⁠These my sacrifice to thee—
Give her life to see the altar’s light one day.

“Hurry here! O get the doctors—call the nurse—
    ⁠Call the priest—be quick—some more digitaline—
He is here, alas! before you all—a hearse.”
    ⁠Death has passed us by; take up the violin!
To Thy heart my music fain would find its way;
⁠    Every sound Thy grace would earn;
    ⁠Let it not as sad return—
Give her life to see the altar’s light one day.

Every wound and every sigh and groan and tear,
    ⁠Every drop of Saada’s melting flesh and hope
Now ascend, wrapt in this music, pale and blear—

What remains, what’s gone of her before Thee lay:
    ⁠Faith and Doubt are at Thy door—
    ⁠Mother, brother, pray, implore—
Give her life to see the altar’s light one day."
A Spring Dirge,"Sad, sad, sad—
    ⁠In vain thou comest, Spring;
Sad, sad, sad—
    ⁠⁠In vain thy birds all sing:
    ⁠    ⁠⁠Perfumeless is thy rose;
⁠    ⁠    ⁠Thy breeze, which softly blows,
    ⁠    ⁠⁠Disturbs my sea of woes,
⁠Ay, Death is on the wing.
Gone, gone, gone—
    ⁠⁠Go seek her, mocking Spring;
Gone, gone, gone—
    ⁠⁠Aside thy garlands fling;
    ⁠    ⁠⁠Destroy thy laughing bower;
    ⁠    ⁠⁠Call back an April shower
⁠    ⁠    ⁠To weep with me this hour:
He came, not reckoning.
Love, love, love—
    ⁠⁠What sendest thou with Spring?
Love, love, love—
⁠    ⁠What tidings these birds bring!
    ⁠    ⁠⁠They tell me they can hear
⁠    ⁠    ⁠Thee, in a higher sphere;
⁠    ⁠    ⁠But can that dry a tear,
Or give my wish a wing?"
My Bornoose,"Into this world they tell me I was sent
Wrapt in a bornoose, which was rudely rent
And flung away, by her who first didst touch
My steaming flesh; I never loved her much,
The surly, stolid, sordid, spectral hag:
For never would my star of fortune lag—
No dwarf of earth to oppose my will would dare—
If my sebaceous bornoose she did spare,
And if around my neck, the ajouz says,
It hung, locked in a charm, for twenty days.
But ever since the amulet was torn,
The curse of gods and jinn and men I’ve worn;
And to my flesh it stuck—a Nessus shirt—
Despite the oozing blood, and not spurt
Of power, alas! is left me to control
The stinging tongue of an avenging soul."
Preparation,"The little bird sits in the nest and sings
    A shy, soft song to the morning light;
And it flutters a little and prunes its wings.
    The song is halting and poor and brief,
    And the fluttering wings scarce stir a leaf;
But the note is a prelude to sweeter things,
    And the busy bill and the flutter slight
    Are proving the wings for a bolder flight!"
The Philistine,"The cricket to the corn-crake came one day,
Shivering, yet buzzing in his wanton way,
        And said: “I’m slain
By hunger, brother, turn thou not from me;
’Tis winter, and I only beg of thee
        A little grain.”

The corn-crake grinned and said in tone sublime:
“Where wert thou hidden in the harvest time,
        Thou dinning drone?
Why didst thou not come with us to the fields
To gather something for thy winter meals
        Of what had grown?”

“O, I was entertaining with my rhymes
The vineyards, and the fig trees, and the thymes
        The summer long.”
“No then,” replied the corn-crake, “not a seed
Have I for such as thou; go home and feed
        Upon thy Song.”"
Upon the Peak of Sanneen,"My soul and I, upon the peak
    Of Sanneen grim and grey,
Sat musing in the twilight of
    A sombre summer day.

“Great Saturn and the Moon are gone
    Together o’er the sea;
But will great Saturn e’er return
    Should he elope with thee?

Ah well, who knows? when thou art gone
    I, too, shall sink within the brine,—
I, too, shall sail above this peak
    And signal yonder groves of pine.

Behold the melancholy sky
    Of this forgotten land;
On this side are the valleys bleak.
    On this, the desert sand.”

“I hear the moaning of the wind,”
    My sad companion said;
“The snow is gathering in me
    And the night is overhead.

Long have we dwelt together, friend,
    In our sweet ennui;
But were I now to take my leave,
    Alas, what would I be?”

“O, think not of departing.
    Ah, too young I am to die;
I’ll find the magic wings; and there
    Still hangs a friendly sky.

Let us above these pines, and clouds,
    And scents awhile yet dwell;—
Where wouldst thou go, if thou wert now
    To sigh a last farewell?”

Thou seest the busy elements
    Dissolving one by one
The souls that are acquitted.
    For the all-absorbing sun.

Let’s sing the song of darkness then;
    Thy prison is the Whole;—
What canst thou do, where wilt thou go,
    What wilt thou be, my Soul?

Thou wouldst not be the air that weighs
    Upon the rising dust;
Thou wouldst not be the fog that chokes
    The air in savage lust.

Thou wouldst not be the clouds that block
    The smoke’s way to a star;
Nor linger in the guilty tears
    Of clouds before the bar.

Thou wouldst not be the rain that taunts
    The all-devouring sea,
Itself destroying many a nest
    In bush and rock and tree.

Thou wouldst not be the thunder’s tongue
    Spell-binding all the spheres;
Nor wouldst thou be the lightning blade
    That stabs and disappears.

Thou wouldst not be the dew that falls
    Alike on thorn and flower;
Nor even the morning zephyr
    That blows o’er den and bower.

Thou wouldst not be the virgin snow
    Set free from yonder clouds,
Only to melt beneath the feet
    Of surging human crowds.”

“No! none of these,” my Soul replied;
    “I’ll shiver ever thrall;
O let me rise, for I would be
    The sky above them all.”"
Hymn,"When storms arise
And dark'ning skies
    About me threat'ning lower,
To thee, O Lord, I raise mine eyes,
To thee my tortured spirit flies
    For solace in that hour.
The mighty arm
Will let no harm
    Come near me nor befall me;
Thy voice shall quiet my alarm,
When life's great battle waxeth warm—
    No foeman shall appall me.
Upon thy breast
Secure I rest,
    From sorrow and vexation;
No more by sinful cares oppressed,
But in thy presence ever blest,
    O God of my salvation."
Dissolution,"I languish in thy penetrating clasp, 
Just as a bird entangled on a bough 
    Shaken by the wind; 
Yet here would I be happy in the grasp
Of death; but in thy breast I'm hidden now, 
    And death is blind. 

I melt beneath thy storm of kisses, dear, 
Just as the gum upon the almond tree
Of melting when alone and far from thee: 
    Melts 'neath the rain; 
Yet would I melt to-night than live in fear 
    O, storm again! "
Unadorned,"Regardless of the cries of priests and sages
I strove to give my bleeding soul her wages; 
   And each embrace or memory of one 
Is worth to me the treasures of the ages, 
Is worth to me the treasures of the ages. 

Each shadow of a kiss or fond embrace
Down in the depth of solitude I trace; 
   And in the corners of my darkest den
The fallen gods of pleasure find a place. 
The fallen gods of pleasure find a place. 

And though knee-deep I find myself in hell, 
And though the flames around my cheeks should swell, 
   I shall not loose my grip on Allah's throne, 
I shall not fall alone, I know full well. 
I shall not fall alone, I know full well. "
Thy Smile,"Outside the gates of night, above the moon,
Where breatheth none but gods, where light alone 
Forever rules from his star-studded throne, 
Where Melancholy never reaches noon, 
And where the Pleiades their harps attune,—
There in the centre of the lightning zone, 
Upon the zephyr which the storm hath sown, 
Thou first wert formed with pleasure to commune.
And now in Pleasure's world, upon the face
Of bright and gay Bohemia's fairest child 
The zephyr dallies with the lightning flash; 
The smile divine, as well the subtle grace
Are deeply there impressed, by naught defiled—
There joy's received as well as paid in cash. "
Lilatu Laili,"At night on the radiant Rialto
   By the stars in their houses of glass,
I strolled with my soul in my pocket
   And prayed that my night might not pass; 
I have seen 'neath the high heels of Beauty
   My heart and my soul and my shame; 
That form! O, how often it lured me, 
   And how often I lost in the game! 
And how often I walked in the shadow 
   Of a Laila a mile and a mile! 
But the rapture and bliss of a vision
   Would end in a great gush of bile. 
To the hints that her garment would whisper 
    I have listened but I would not dare; 
I have seen every one of my fancies 
   Retreat in the dark of her hair. 
I have wished that each building around us 
   Was a cedar, a poplar, a pine; 
That the men and the women were statues, 
   And the rain that was falling was wine; 
That the lights were ethereal flowers; 
   That the cars were the nooks in the wood,—
""O, enough!"" she exclaimed as she kissed me, 
    ""This attic and couch are as good."" "
Let Thine Eyes Whisper,"      Grieve not, for I am near thee; 
      Sigh not, for I can hear thee;
Wash from thy heart all memory of past wrong; 
      Doubt not that doubts besmear thee; 
      Speak not, for I do fear thee; 
Let thine eyes whisper love's conciling song. "
Retribution,"How I did hold in deep contempt
   The slaves and queens of love! 
How I disguised my feelings when 
    I met a deer or a dove! 
How I did smile and sniff and rail 
    At lovers young and old; 
How I denied, in days gone by, 
    O love, thy charms untold! 
But now, alas! I find myself 
    In chains at Beauty's shrine: 
The chains whose power I have denied
   Are sapping, sapping mine. "

titá with a long finger and a wide hand
screams towards the roof, crucified by the air’s motor.
             they have the same faces and last names
             as your grandparents’ assassins, they look like your
                  parents’ bosses,
             they govern, they direct traffic, they lean against their
                  motorcycles.
the children start desperately crying.
their faces melt from the air conditioner’s cold
where a bird plants a nest.
they don’t know how to draw nothings in books.
they don’t know how to imagine themselves
by erasing pasts.
a great beach ball deflates in their hands.
a mangy dog licks their ears.
the outlets throw sparks, collective cough,
plagues of soaked shoes.
no one knows how to recognize assassins.

Ever to Be,"My far cry, though no one should echo,—
    Though no one to listen should stand,
I shall dare with my burden the darkness
    And I shall not retreat from this land;
Though I’m hurled ’neath the feet of the millions,
    Who struggle their places to keep,
The sea-nymphs still bathe with my fancy
    And the Dryads still sweeten my sleep.
Though I’m crushed, cast away and forgotten,—
    Though I’m buried in the dust of their cars,
I can see through their madness above me,—
    I can feel the quick pulse of the stars;
Though my head be the foot-stool of tyrants,
    Though my back be a step to their throne,
I still dwell with the kings of Orion
    And I walk with the sun-queen alone.
Though the fire of my youth should consume me,—
    Though my body a brimstone should be,
I can draw on the clouds for their water,
    And behold! I’ve of water a sea;
And though roofless, and friendless, and hopeless
    And loveless, and godless I stand,
The waves of my Life shall continue
    To murmur and laugh on the Strand ."
to approach,"treatment belongs to water.
it designates the sum of all relations one has with another.
you might say the life schemed between two is treatment.
to treat water is to cure it for consumption, but your
treatment speaks volumes about your desire to bear witness.
to treat you like water, i’d have to assume you as essential and
      daily.
i aspire to this when i fall in love, that you be my water.
since we are both from here, we are a bit
contaminated, which treatment must consider.
i treat you like an island looks at another and understands
      water is power.
i know i’m mixing things, but treatment is the mixture of all
      the things
we did to each other when we they took our land, cut down
      our forests
and distributed our crops.
it isn’t a metaphor when i say crop.
sometimes it’s a metaphor when i talk about us and water.
it’s easy to get confused with so much barnacle language
stuck to our wall.
confusion is a way of getting close.
i come close, fail, and fall in love.
treatment is the sum of all relations had
with each person i knew on this island.
each i loved, to a greater or lesser degree.
if they hurt me or took my shirt,
they are still part of the treaty we signed.
    la aproximación
el trato pertenece al agua.
designa la totalidad de relaciones que tienes con otro.
se podría decir que la vida que se trama entre dos es trato.
tratar el agua es curarla para el consumo, pero tu
trato habla volúmenes de tus ganas de presenciarnos.
al tratarte como agua, te asumiría como esencial y cotidiana.
a esto aspiro cuando me enamoro, a que seas mi agua.
como somos los dos de aquí, estamos un poco
contaminados y el trato debe tomarlo en cuenta.
te trato como una isla que mira a otra isla y entiende que el
      agua es poder.
sé que mezclo cosas, pero el trato es la mezcla de todas las cosas
que nos hicimos cuando nos quitaron la tierra, talaron nuestros
      bosques     
y repartieron los frutos.
no es metáfora cuando digo fruto.
a veces es metáfora cuando hablo del agua y de nosotros.
es fácil confundirse con tanto lenguaje de percebe
pegado a nuestro muro.
confundirse es una manera de acercarse.
me aproximo, fallo y me enamoro.
el trato es la suma de las relaciones que tuve
con cada persona que conocí en esta isla,
a quienes amé en menor y mayor grado.
si me hirieron o me quitaron la camisa,
igual son parte del trato que firmamos."
mausoleum of flowers,"split earth’s rotting wound. your body,
a mausoleum hanging over its lip—
like a made thing. plucking flowers
on our walks, you study them close,
stumbling over your brand-new feet.
they’ll die before we make it home,
i don’t say. you are a botanist
& know all about self-
preservation. know there is no grey
in death—& you are very much alive"
Blessing,"for my son, enwombed
May you harvest your language from the alphabet of butterflies, 
may their wings brushstroke your name on translucent scrolls, 
filter air for your breath, teach you flight the way I can’t.  
May you preserve the wisdom with which you arrive, 
the metaphors through which you’ll first parse the world,
the moon always a ripe banana, always within reach.  
May your fingers tease and probe all truths. 
It’s not the grain of sand, as we hold dear, but organisms 
wayward in their drift that, trapped, abrade the oyster’s flesh.  
Errant breather smothered into loveliness, 
the pearl has its own song. 
If you drag it ashore 
language loses meaning,
so bring your ear to the ocean floor.
There, neither fish nor son, eavesdrop. 
Neither fish nor son yet, 
call sister sister and lie awhile by the echo. 
While there, bless the echo and learn 
how to lie to me beautifully. "
"Dear Aleph,","You’re correct. Every nation hates
its children. This is a requirement of statehood.
This and empathy.
Empathy means
laying yourself down
in someone else’s chalklines
and snapping a photo. A Chrysler
with four bullet holes
in the rear passenger door
just drove by calmly, signaling
before it turned. Oh, Mrs. Evans,
you’re such a wonderful woman,
said, supposedly, Ethel Rosenberg
to the woman who walked her
to the chair.
It was empathy on Evans’s part.
Love on Ethel’s.
I am a wonderful woman
more often than I care to admit.
We are going to have
our first woman president."
One Hundred Love Sonnets: XVII (I don’t love you as if you were a rose),"I don’t love you as if you were a rose of salt, topaz,
or arrow of carnations that propagate fire:
I love you as one loves certain obscure things,
secretly, between the shadow and the soul.
I love you as the plant that doesn’t bloom but carries
the light of those flowers, hidden, within itself,
and thanks to your love the tight aroma that arose
from the earth lives dimly in my body.
I love you without knowing how, or when, or from where,
I love you directly without problems or pride:
I love you like this because I don’t know any other way
        to love,
except in this form in which I am not nor are you,
so close that your hand upon my chest is mine,
so close that your eyes close with my dreams.
Cien Sonetos de Amor: XVII (No te amo como si fueras rosa)
No te amo como si fueras rosa de sal, topacio
o flecha de claveles que propagan el fuego:
te amo como se aman ciertas cosas oscuras,
secretamente, entre la sombra y el alma.
Te amo como la planta que no florece y lleva
dentro de sí, escondida, la luz de aquellas flores,
y gracias a tu amor vive oscuro en mi cuerpo
el apretado aroma que ascendió de la tierra.
Te amo sin saber como, ni cuándo, ni de dónde,
Te amo directamente sin problemas ni orgullo:
así te amo porque no sé amar de otra manera,
sino así de este modo en que no soy ni eres,
tan cerca que tu mano sobre mi pecho es mía,
tan cerca que se cierran tus ojos con mi sueño.  "
Tankas for what Comes Together,"At the seashore, wind
almost lifts our spindrift bodies,
sand scrapes our skin.
Let that sleek seal beat back the waves—
thunder amasses in cloud.
I do not believe in the failure of caring
for each other. How
can I when the cascading waves
gather us all in the rise?"
Menopause,"For further reference: I go to love
like a fire engine to a three-alarm,                              flashing
and spinning, yelling across town. Nothing
to be afraid of: the ceiling falling,                                windows 
concave, doors bowed and stiff. My body 
parts fall to, like I was made                                        of the heat. 
Everyone watches, chest-clutching, pointing. 
Inhalation will surely be the cause of                         my death.
Urban myth says an aging vagina once
well-used will shrink from lack                                    of exercise.
I would think, instead, like the collar of a sweater,
stretched, gaping. Or a fish out                                   of water,
grasping for purchase. A soft pop every time
you check to see whether or not                                 it is dead.
I want a song to be written about me: black
pearls, sulfur, bronze-plated silver.                             It should 
have a verse about blood-soaked hands,
a chorus that is a shout of                                            AAAAAHHHHH!
[Sing it with me:                                                              AAAAAHHHHH!]
It won’t be a song where someone stares into 
lit windows from the end of a driveway                     on the last note."
For the Bird Singing before Dawn,"Some people presume to be hopeful
when there is no evidence for hope,
to be happy when there is no cause.
Let me say now, I’m with them.
In deep darkness on a cold twig
in a dangerous world, one first
little fluff lets out a peep, a warble,
a song—and in a little while, behold:
the first glimmer comes, then a glow
filters through the misty trees,
then the bold sun rises, then
everyone starts bustling about.
And that first crazy optimist, can we
forgive her for thinking, dawn by dawn,
“Hey, I made that happen!
And oh, life is so fine.”"
Remember the Puns & Brashbrandy,"for Jack Hirschman (1933-2021)
The words always came running out of your mouth
Tumbling, galloping
Pushing against one another as they took the final turn
The last hundred meters
Where form is lost 
& everyone becomes a futurist
Sacred words split into syllables & break apart
Yours never had wings affixed to them
Only the hammer & sickle 
Harnessed with gumshoe & printing press
Long gray hair alighting from your form
& that gait you had
As if you’d been riding motorcycles all night long
Bowlegged, rickety even 
Probably from kicking fascists in your sleep 
& the other death-headed sorts
You had the sparkle, loud & lavish laughter
Bellowing even
A clamor to stoke awake the fires inside
& push against the fulcrum of the dreadful state
In time, overtaken by the glow & tether of your arcanes
Where life mingled with apparitions 
It’s how you made memory & the present inseparable
Obsecrating all those pages turned 
Dog-eared & brittle after a stretch
To lay words before us, like crumbs
Four thousand pages later
Leaving a richer trail
I remember the raddled years
When you lived like a pauper
Grinning wide & showing off your crooked teeth
More beautiful than any others
The final words I whispered to you
That was wonderful 
Are still ringing in your ears
Though vibrating waves of compression
& rarefactions are dust now
Just in case, let me say it again
That was wonderful"
Vista,"What goes extinct while grazing on memory’s lawn in the sun? 
When you said, “I’d cut my tongue,” I grew a callus over your mouth.
Once, I tiptoed to catch a glimpse of you though I was not yours, 
but there was recognition through the window, my eyes knocking
on cleansed glass, as I closed further into sleep, into preludes,
away from you. Why am I speaking at all when what’s unsaid
between us is a rosette of moth wings, beating in the sky’s eardrum.  
I don’t flock to passions when I seek you; if all was taken, who would you be?  
Still, I know what I sensed as I watched you swim out from under the bridge
trying to sip the Pacific. If it wasn’t for the undercurrent, I’d have let
you go further, but the hour was a cool blue cluttered with your lips.  
There’s a story you know: it begins with your right hand over mine, 
as I practice my handwriting: I lay my alephs here, like ripe fruit, like a home away. "
[The sun is lord of life and colour],"The sun is lord of life and colour,
Blood of the rose and hyacinth,
Hair of the sea and forests,
Crown of the cornfields,
Body of the hills.
The moon is the harlot of Death,
Slaughterer of the sun,
Priestess and poisoner she goes
With all her silver flock of wandering souls,
Her chant of wailing waters,
The bed of shimmering dust from which she comes
Bound all around with bandages of mist….
The living are as blossoms and fruit on the tree,
The dead are as lilies and wind on the marshes;
The living are as cherries that bow to the morning
Beckoning to the loitering stranger,
The wind, to sing them his eerie ballads.
The dead are as frozen skeleton branches
Whereon the stillness perches like an owl….
The dead are as snow on the cherry orchard."
A Peasant's Song,"O, thou, who loved me once,
From thy Pagoda glance ;
Shoot down a poisoned lance :
        All’s well that comes from thee.
Look back, look down once more ;
Dear was to thee this shore ;
I see thee nevermore
        Beneath the olive tree.
Remains my station low,
Whilst thou dost greater grow ;
Ah, fate hath struck the blow
        That parted thee and me.
How can I bear my fate,
How can I loveless wait
In this most sorry state,
        When thou art far and free?
Far from the soul that swore
On love’s abysmal door
To cling forevermore
        To none on earth but thee ;
Free from the sacred plight
Which, to dispel the night,
Thou madest, when I quite
        Fell near thy bended knee.
Dost thou not still remember
Love’s May and Love’s December?
Both burned their sacred ember
        In our sweet company.
Dost hear the echoes fall
Within thy gilded hall?
Dost thou not ever recall
        The day thou wert like me?
When all thy gardens bloom,
Look out into the gloom ;
There does the flame consume
        Thy budless lilac tree.
There often thou didst play
A-mindless of the day
When soul to soul would say :
        “No more of thee and me.”
And when withers thy rose,
Throw to the wind that blows
This way a leaf ; who knows
        What therein I can see.
And till my course is run
I’ll count them one by one—
These leaves ; and may the sun
        Of joy ne’er set on thee."
Kennedy in Wexford,"There has always been a rumour that the local Bishop
Died the day before Kennedy came to Wexford
In June 1963. There was a feeling, rightly,
That the death would put a damper on the whole occasion.
People might mourn the Bishop or praise the President,
But they could hardly do both on the same day,
So the announcement of the death was postponed,
Until Kennedy had left. A good few must have known,
But they kept quiet on the matter. I have often wondered
If the very prospect of the visit did not, in fact, kill the Bishop.
Perhaps it affected his nervous system. Or froze his heart.
In any case, he lay there undead and unalive, virtual,
His episcopal soul in suspension, like Schrödinger’s cat,
Until Kennedy had waved at us all and departed.
Unlike Kennedy, the Bishop was a good-living, pious man.
He wrote a pamphlet on ‘The Christian Home’ and caused
No fuss until his untimely end. So, once the coast was clear,
You can be sure he went straight to heaven. Yet despite all this,
I believe that if people had been asked to choose between
A dead bishop and a live President, they would have opted for
The latter. I was only eight, but I too would have cheered
For Kennedy. I had been taken out of school and liked
Excitement. We stood on the quays and waited for his car
And went home with news of his suntan and his teeth."
Vinegar Hill,"The town reservoir on the hill
Was built in the forties.
If you lifted a round metal covering
And dropped a stone, you could
Hear it plonk into the depths.
There were small hollows in the rocks
That, no matter how dry the weather,
Were filled with rainwater.
These rock-pools must have been here
With different water in them
That summer when the rebels
Fled towards Needham’s Gap.
From the hill, as the croppies did,
You can view the town, narrow
Streets even narrower, and more
Trees and gardens than you imagined. 
It was burning then, of course,
But now, it is quiet. There is,
In the Market Square, a monument
To Father Murphy and the Croppy Boy.
We can see the hill from our house.
It is solid rock in the mornings
As the sun appears from just behind it.
It changes as the day does.
My mother is taking art classes
And, thinking it natural to make
The hill her focal point,
Is trying to paint it.
What colour is Vinegar Hill?
How does it rise above the town?
It is humped as much as round.
There is no point in invoking
History. The hill is above all that,
Intractable, unknowable, serene.
It is in shade, then in light,
And often caught between
When the blue becomes grey
And fades more, the green glistens,
And then not so much. The rock also
Glints in the afternoon light
That dwindles, making the glint disappear.
Then there is the small matter of clouds
That made tracks over the hill in a smoke
Of white as though instructed
By their superiors to break camp.
They change their shape, crouch down
Stay still, all camouflage, dreamy,
Lost, with no strategy to speak of,
Yet resigned to the inevitable:
When the wind comes for them, they will retreat.
Until this time, they are surrounded by sky
And can, as yet, envisage no way out."
The God Of My Goddess,"The old gods and their slaves I’ve deserted ;
    The new gods I’ve shunned at first sight ;
And my god is the god of the goddess
    That presides at my feast of delight.
But once, when the dark moment lingered,
    I questioned the god she adores ;
To his throne I implored her to lead me,
    And, behold! I’m the god she implores."
Independent Blossoms,"When the spring boughs were told
Soon the rose will unfold
    Herself in the bower
           Of which she is queen,
Their blossoms, beguiling
The sad leaves, said smiling :
    “No slaves to a flower
        Have we ever been.”
Our lords are the birds.
And they love not in words ;
    They sing when we smile
           And sob when we fall ;
Her lord is the liar—
The thief or the buyer—
    Who smells her the while
           She lives, and that’s all."
September,"The first September of the pandemic,
The sky’s a watercolour, white and grey,
And Pembroke Street is empty, and so is
Leeson Street. This is the time after time,
What the world will look like when the world
Is over, when people have been ushered into
Seats reserved for them in the luminous
Heavens.
                Moving towards the corner of
Upper Pembroke Street and Leeson Street,
An elderly man wears a mask; his walk is
Sprightly, his movements brisk. I catch
His watery eye for a watery moment. 
Without stopping, all matter-of-fact,
He says: ‘Someone told me you were dead.’"
The Fruits Of Death,"     I
Said golden leaves upon the ground 
    To new born leaves upon the tree : 
“Soon homeward autumn winds will blow 
    And carry us away to sea, 
Just as it shook the night before 
    The branches all and set us free ; 
No longer do we envy bird or dew, 
Nor do we want again to be like you.” 
    II
The sweet and tender leaves replied : 
    “Still we rejoice that we are here ; 
We rise from the eternal source 
    Of life to crown the dying year ; 
The wind that freed you we can see. 
    The sea you love we always hear. 
You are the booty of the storm and we,
We are the fruits of Death upon Life’s tree.”"
Three Golden Threads (After de Lisle.),"Like yonder swallow, I would soar away,—
    Above the sea, far from this buzzing mart ;
But how can I?      A cruel, little fay
    Has fettered with three golden threads my heart.
Her honeyed tongue the one ; her eyes the other ;
    The third her lips ; and that completes her art.
No fruits from other gardens can I gather,
    For she has tied with golden threads my heart.
O, how I would asunder rend my chain,
    And from the tears and pangs of love depart ;
Ah, no!  ’tis better that I die in pain
    Than break the golden threads of my poor heart."
Rest,"Long have I a word enshrined 
And worshipped with a piety blind! 
Long have I been seeking Rest 
In the East and in the West! 
Here and there and everywhere 
Have I seen her shadow fair ; 
But the shadow seems to fade 
Like the flowers of yonder glade. 
In my lone retreat I sought 
Her, but dreams against me fought. 
In my nights for her I pray, 
But with sleep she stays away. 
Foolish is thine effort, vain— 
Fruitless, hopeless is thy pain! 
With the march of Motion keep, 
In thy walk and in thy sleep 
Beyond thy finite power it lies 
To chain the coursers of the skies. 
Even nomads and cells minute 
Worlds of unrest constitute. 
Rest is no where to be found ; 
Each to all in suffering bound. 
And no power can deliver thee, 
Mortal, from activity. 
In thy life as in thy death, 
In thy heart as in thy breath, 
On the earth as in the skies 
Restless Motion never dies. 
Always raging, always spinning, 
Endless and without beginning. 
Death, like me, is seeking Rest, 
And all the seas are in her quest ; 
But ah, poor souls, she is beyond 
Our grasp ; we must go on and on. 
No, nor even the grave is free 
From the laws that shackle me ; 
New life from his worms takes wing,
And on his face fresh blossoms spring."
The Tomb And The Rose (After Victor Hugo.),"The Tomb said to the Rose : 
O Flower of Love, where goes 
Each tear which Dawn upon thy cheeks doth 
          shed? 
The Rose said to the Tomb : 
What makest in thy gloom 
Impenetrable of the countless dead? 
Said the Rose : O Tomb, of all these tears, 
In my recesses ere the sun appears, 
I make a perfume which the gods will prize. 
Said the Tomb : O plaintive Flower, 
Of every mortal I devour 
An angel do I make for Paradise."
To The Sonnet,"Though cribbed and gyved, thou canst within thy 
          walls 
Unfold a wondrous wealth of worlds unseen,
And flood the soul’s abyss with moon-light sheen,
As well as darken passions’ gilded halls ; 
Thy fourteen outlets are so many falls 
From which gush out the prisoned joy, or 
         spleen— 
The silvery cascades, or the billows green,
And either a sea of bliss or grief recalls. 
Thou goddess of the gems of Fancy’s deep, 
Though few thy facets, they reflect the whole 
Of inner-self in multi-shaded hues ; 
Thou art the couch of dreams that never sleep ; 
Thou art the phoenix of the poet’s soul,
As well the crystal palace of his muse."
Beneath The Salvias,"Beneath the salvias, where some angel slew 
The favors that were granted by his god, 
My heart is hidden ; let thy feet be shod 
With feathers plucked from my wings of crim- 
         son hue. 
When here again thou might’st be wandering 
         through ; 
Look not above; I’m breathing in the sod, 
A-mindless of the years, ’neath which I’m trod— 
Of Spring birds’ song, or shrieks of Winter’s 
         crew. 
Here let me sleep, my lady: wake me not ; 
Here let me gather, hidden from the moon 
And the sun, the strength to rise again and see ; 
No sweeter, dearer, more enchanting spot 
Is there for my sick heart ; O, not so soon— 
Awake me not—O, let me dream of thee."
Stolen Salvias,"O, bleeding blossoms, tell, were my heart there— 
               There in your bed, 
Would that sweet thief that stole you unaware 
               Have stolen it instead ? 
Come with me, scarlet salvias, to your home ; 
               We are not late ; 
Love in the moonlight there again will roam— 
               There let us wait. 
I still remember when one night she crowned 
               Me with the stars 
Plucked from your scarlet sky—she would 
          astound 
              The kings of Mars. 
She then would slay me—wash the face of night 
              With my bold blood— 
Ay, she would show that yours is not as bright 
              And not as good. 
O, scarlet salvias, why should I refuse 
              When I’m with you ? 
Why should I chill my lady, if she choose 
              To steal me too ?"
Jealousy,"The violets their soft, dark lashes part, 
    While robins serenade them far and near ; 
But the anemone, with ebon heart 
    And blood-shot eyes, pretends she does not 
          hear. 
The violets invite the nightingale 
    Whose carols fall in dew upon their bed ; 
But the hydrangea, as saffron pale, 
    Holds high above the wall her nodding head."
Saada,"Long hast thou suffered, sister of my heart, 
              Still thou art 
              Fair to see ; 
Thy pains thou entertainest with thy song, 
              But how long 
              Will this be? 
The seasons all have come and gone, my dear, 
              But thy cheer 
              Still abides. 
I ask which of thy moan or song is best 
              And thou sayst : 
              “God decides.” 
I feel the ebbing of the undertone 
              Of thy moan 
              In thy song ; 
How long will tears and irony compete 
              For thee, Sweet, 
              O, how long? 
When wilt thou, Baby dear, with nimble feet, 
              Run to greet 
              Me at the door? 
When wilt thou, Saada, walk again with me 
              Near the sea, 
              As before? 
O sister, how I wish to see thee run, 
              In the sun, 
              On the sands ! 
The singing breakers and the smiling beach 
              To thee reach 
              Out their hands. 
The light of day is longing for thy face 
              And the grace 
              Of thy form ; 
O how I wish to see thee, Noor-ul-Ain 
              Caught again 
              In the storm !"

A Nocturn,"Upon the face of darkness beams my soul— 
    Nearby, behind the curtains of my sight; 
And ’round it weary waves of wonder roll— 
    Sad seas of color o’er dead seas of light: 
    Here is no Space, no Time—nor day nor night— 
Here is the boundless, undiminished Whole— 
                 Here is my soul.
Here is no love that hides beneath its shoal 
    The sandix that can redden a sea of years; 
Here is no lust that lies to Beauty’s mole 
    And draws from eyes of flint a flood of tears; 
    Here is no disenchantment and no fears— 
No blasted hopes, no jaunty joy, no dole— 
                 Here is my soul. 
Now lost in clay and water; now the Whole 
    Is lost within me: sea and earth and sky 
I dismiss from my presence, as I roll 
    My lids and lo, the lord of night am I. 
    Into the airless wilderness I fly; 
Here is no vain desire, no galling goal— 
                Here is my soul. 
In Eternity, shod with the hoary noul 
    Of deathless Death—in dim and shimmering shades 
Of soilless vales that bosom and cajole 
    The crystal flowers dropping from cloud-cascades; 
    Here in the grove of myriad colonnades 
Of jet and pearl and amber I now stroll— 
                Here is my soul."

Her First Sorrow,"’T is but a score of hours when he didst swear
My sorrow and my joy to share.
    Despite the fates, fore’er ;
But now he’s gone to cash again his lie ;
    Others his shame with me will wear,
                  Why should I die?
Last night his lips my very feet didst burn ;
His kisses dropt, my love to earn,
    Whichever way he’d turn ;
But now he’s gone another soul to rob,
    Another heart to lure and spurn,
                   Why should I sob?
He did not kiss me when he said good-bye ;
I let him go, not asking why,
    Nor do I for him sigh ;
He’s gone another virgin breast to tear.
    He’s gone on other lips to die,
                    Why should I care?"
The Brass Bed,"I love thy color and thy symmetry ;
I love the art that wrought thy glittering arms.
Thy canopy, thy satin portieres too ;
I love the silks and feathers on thy breast—
The cushions and the pillows and the quilts :
I love thine every part.
Yet still more do I love to rest in thee—
To dream of art’s perfection in thy frame ;
Of paths as smooth, as shining as thy limbs ;
Of scenes as exquisite as thy coils ;
Of nooks as warm as thine hospitable bosom,
As cool and as refreshing as thy veinless naked arms,
I dream of all beneath thy soothing mantle.
But O, I love my dreams much more than thee,
And one sad soul much more than all my dreams.
If thou hadst but an eye to see,
To look upon the guest that lay upon thy floor
Beneath thy silken ceiling !
O, hadst thou but an ear to hear
The plaintive chirpings of this swallow-soul.
Couldst thou but feel her forehead
Moistened with the sweat of hope and pain.
For forty moons she lay within thine arms,
Rubbing her erstwhile rosy cheeks
Against the ulcers of Ayoub of yore.
Couldst thou but see, O Bed of Brass,
Couldst thou but hear, couldst thou but feel,—
Of what use all thy showy stuff—
Thy glittering brass, the filigree of art,
Thy floor of down and feather cushions all,
Thy snow-white mantles, satin tapestries?
Beauty and Pain!
Death will not come with thee, O Pain!
Life will not come with thee, O Beauty!
The fires of hell are but a taper’s flame compared to this.
Thy guest, O Bed of Brass,
Looks on thee with a yearning glance,
And vet her soul, bearing the torch of Pain,
Is searching all the worlds for Death."
The Moonlight,"I waited on
In the late autumn moonlight,
A train droning out of thought—
The mind on moonlight
And on trains.
Blind as a thread of water
Stirring through a cold like dust,
Lonely beyond all silence
And humming this to children,
The nostalgic listeners in sleep,
Because no guardian
Strides through distance upon distance,
His eyes a web of sleep."
The City,"after C. P. Cavafy
You tell me: I’m going to another country,
another city, another body.
Perhaps my heart will stay uncertain,
and I will destroy my history but I am leaving.
Even if on every street, I find the ruins of our bodies,
I’ll roam like a restless soul anyway.
I tell you: you won’t find a new country,
new city, new body. You’ll return to roam
the same ruins, same streets, same quartiere,
return to complain in the same room
of the same house, return to the memory of our intertwined bodies.
You will always end up in Roma: I will always remain in you.
And maybe late, you’ll see, that what you destroyed
is worth more than all the worlds you wasted your time in."
Mr. Chairman Takes His Leave,"As to me, I know of nothing else but miracles.
—Walt Whitman 
 en memoria William Rashall Sinkin, 1913–2014 
Whitman, you once told me, is democracy on the page, messy 
and imperfect as we are in real life, which gave you hope 
that we would one day make real life true democracy, ripe blossom,
pollen dusting every moment and person, each scampering mote of light. 
This is why as you lay dying, I read “I Hear America Singing”
and knew you heard every word and could feel my hand on yours 
though you were already moving toward other miracles than this life.
A sunflower followed your motion and a yellow dog stood guard. 
You, who lived the notion that the sun belongs to each and every one,
beggars, dreamers, kings, all. You who believed banks could have hearts, 
for god’s sake! You have left it to us, messy and imperfect
as we are and will be, to keep to the work side by side 
and as long as it takes, all the while singing of miracles
just as Whitman and you taught us to do. Meanwhile, you 
were last seen wearing blue-plaid pajamas, a contrasting
blue-plaid bow tie, and surrounded by hummingbirds. 
Hummingbirds leave Texas in early February, migrating north
to make new lives. The angle of the sun tells them precisely when 
to take their leave. They arrive thousands of miles away
in mid-May, about the time of your birthday. A sunflower 
follows your motion. The yellow dog stands guard."
Imagining My Neighbor,"Now that night has fallen like a broken cart,
he cups his ear against the old red radio,  
attempting to tune out the stream
of unintelligible street verbiage  
leaking thru the window.  
Earlier, he opened all the blinds,
but left the front door closed.
Why do we seal off those places
flooding the greater light?
I imagine in the quiet cottage of his brain
the sepia of this desert city,
wind, dirt, grit that scuffs your skin.
Wish him gentleness in the shade of shadows.
We spoke once. “This heat. Too much,” he tells me.
His birth city is a place where the Pacific baptizes
each morning with softness, the smell of seaweed.
Each day predictable as a calendar.
Today he is a leopard lizard
stalking his oppressor for that which is too much.
I shut blinds. Retreat from voyeurism.  
I have no heat or words to offer him.
I am a wheel that does not move the cart."
My Love Must Be As Free,"My love must be as free 
    As is the eagle's wing, 
Hovering o'er land and sea 
    And everything 
I must not dim my eye 
    In thy saloon, 
I must not leave my sky 
    And nightly moon 
Be not the fowler's net 
    Which stays my flight, 
And craftily is set 
    T' allure the sight
But be the favoring gale 
    That bears me on, 
And still doth fill my sail 
    When thou art gone 
I cannot leave my sky 
    For thy caprice, 
True love would soar as high 
    As heaven is 
The eagle would not brook 
    Her mate thus won, 
Who trained his eye to look 
    Beneath the sun"
Guitarrero!,"Cyrus, always I try to put my soul
into building a guitar,
here on Cuesta de Gomerez,
full of sovereign guitar-makers,
street slanting up to an arch
of the colossal Alhambra.
What I worship is the feeling of the wood
in my hardworking hands,
wood selected and dried
for a three-decade minimum,
so I’m refining Mediterranean
or Canadian cypress,
Macassar ebony, and Lebanese cedar
that my paternal grandfather chose,
Abuelo Leonel who perished
the Satan-hot August
right before I was born
into a dynasty of on-fire
flamenco musicians and dancers.
Imagine, a top notch guitar
means perhaps a hundred hours
of dedicated labor, and, so help me,
I don’t work by the clock—
Sometimes it costs me
most of a day to adjust
the nitty-gritty strings and frets,
to insure the vigorous, brave sound
we’re famous for in Granada:
due to the vega’s dry air,
instruments from the Andalusian school
are (no doubt about it!) lighter,
distinctive—like a palace starling
or a peerless voice
that gently breathes and sings
in a stone basilica on Sunday morning—
acoustic splendor and tone to rival
the able makers in Madrid—
At the fabled Moorish citadel’s hem,
I bring my busy-as-hell hands
to the timeless task of planing
and judge the thickness
of my newly launched guitars
with my tried-and-true fingers.
The tradition, I tell you, is to present
your very first guitar as a gift
to the regal, lullaby-whispering woman
who latched you to this bustling,
wondrous world:
Oh what an exhilarating day
when my never-fail mother, Primavera,
carefully inspected my first ever piece,
proclaiming (almost singing it!):
Guitarrero!"
True Kindness Is a Pure Divine Affinity,"True kindness is a pure divine affinity,
Not founded upon human consanguinity
It is a spirit, not a blood relation,
Superior to family and station"
Home,"He looked so tired after breakfast
says the nurse
we put him back to bed.
She presses a button
and my father
rises toward us.
For something to say
mum remembers
that time you stole apples
from Jimmy Snoddy’s garden!
He smiles at her
slyly. He’s saying
nothing.
Outside the window
a bullfinch is feasting
on birch buds."
From Brooklyn,"Along the shore
A black net of branches
Tangles the pulpy yellow lamps.
The shell-colored sky is lustrous with the fading sun.
Across the river Manhattan floats—
Dim gardens of fire—
And rushing invisible toward me through the fog,
A hurricane of faces."
"Dong, Sounds The Brass In The East","Dong, sounds the brass in the east,
As if to a funeral feast,
But I like that sound the best
Out of the fluttering west
The steeple ringeth a knell,
But the fairies' silvery bell
Is the voice of that gentle folk,
Or else the horizon that spoke
Its metal is not of brass,
But air, and water, and glass,
And under a cloud it is swung,
And by the wind it is rung,
When the steeple tolleth the noon
It soundeth not so soon,
Yet it rings a far earlier hour,
And the sun has not reached its tower"
Dirge,"Place this bunch of mignonette
    In her cold, dead hand;
When the golden sun is set,
    Where the poplars stand,
Bury her from sun and day,
Lay my little love away
    From my sight.
She was like a modest flower
    Blown in sunny June,
Warm as sun at noon's high hour,
    Chaster than the moon.
Ah, her day was brief and bright,
Earth has lost a star of light;
    She is dead.
Softly breathe her name to me,—
    Ah, I loved her so.
Gentle let your tribute be;
None may better know
    Her true worth than I who weep
O'er her as she lies asleep—
    Soft asleep.
Lay these lilies on her breast,
    They are not more white
Than the soul of her, at rest
    'Neath their petals bright.
Chant your aves soft and low,
Solemn be your tread and slow,—
    She is dead.
Lay her here beneath the grass,
    Cool and green and sweet,
Where the gentle brook may pass
    Crooning at her feet.
Nature's bards shall come and sing,
And the fairest flowers shall spring
    Where she lies.
Safe above the water's swirl,
    She has crossed the bar;
Earth has lost a precious pearl,
    Heaven has gained a star,
That shall ever sing and shine,
Till it quells this grief of mine
    For my love."
A Drowsy Day,"The air is dark, the sky is gray,
    The misty shadows come and go,
And here within my dusky room
Each chair looks ghostly in the gloom.
    Outside the rain falls cold and slow—
Half-stinging drops, half-blinding spray.
Each slightest sound is magnified,
    For drowsy quiet holds her reign;
The burnt stick in the fireplace breaks,
The nodding cat with start awakes,
    And then to sleep drops off again,
Unheeding Towser at her side.
I look far out across the lawn,
    Where huddled stand the silly sheep;
My work lies idle at my hands,
My thoughts fly out like scattered strands
    Of thread, and on the verge of sleep—
Still half awake—I dream and yawn.
What spirits rise before my eyes!
    How various of kind and form!
Sweet memories of days long past,
The dreams of youth that could not last,
    Each smiling calm, each raging storm,
That swept across my early skies.
Half seen, the bare, gaunt-fingered boughs
    Before my window sweep and sway,
And chafe in tortures of unrest.
My chin sinks down upon my breast;
    I cannot work on such a day,
But only sit and dream and drowse."
Dawn,"An angel, robed in spotless white,
Bent down and kissed the sleeping Night.
Night woke to blush; the sprite was gone.
Men saw the blush and called it Dawn."
"I Am Bound, I Am Bound, For A Distant Shore","I am bound, I am bound, for a distant shore,
By a lonely isle, by a far Azore,
There it is, there it is, the treasure I seek,
On the barren sands of a desolate creek"
It Is No Dream Of Mine,"It is no dream of mine,
To ornament a line,
I cannot come nearer to God and Heaven
Than I live to Walden even
I am its stony shore,
And the breeze that passes o'er,
In the hollow of my hand
Are its water and its sand,
And its deepest resort
Lies high in my thought"
Mouth Still Open,"Someone’s mouth is still open. He hadn’t finished yawning
when shrapnel
pierced
through
his chest,
stung his
heart.
No wind
could
stop the
flying pieces
of shrapnel. Even
the sparrow on the lemon tree nearby wondered how they
           could
                               move
                               with
        
                      no
wings"
Men Say They Know Many Things,"Men say they know many things,
But lo’ they have taken wings, —
The arts and sciences,
And a thousand appliances,
The wind that blows
Is all that any body knows"
Thou Dusky Spirit Of The Wood,"Thou dusky spirit of the wood,
Bird of an ancient brood,
Flitting thy lonely way,
A meteor in the summer's day,
From wood to wood, from hill to hill,
Low over forest, field and rill,
What wouldst thou say?
Why shouldst thou haunt the day?
What makes thy melancholy float?
What bravery inspires thy throat,
And bears thee up above the clouds,
Over desponding human crowds,
Which far below
Lay thy haunts low?"
Sunday,"So this is Sunday evening 
under the live oak behind the kitchen 
where the Rose of Sharon 
spills purple tea onto the grass, 
the yellow bells sound yellow alarms 
from tall stalks, and the sunflowers peep
over the fence into the street
where car tires lap at the pavement
and walkers and joggers and dogs and strollers
pass. Our weeping
persimmon makes a small room
under its branches that children
younger than mine could inhabit 
for an afternoon. Squirrels chase 
each other up the live oak trunk, scratching
the bark. Crape myrtle, peach, plum:
our tiny arboretum. 
We had another tree that had room  
for two girls to sit in it, but the winter freeze
killed it. Gone, too,  
the neighbor whose name I never learned
who yelled at speeding cars in her front yard
wearing only a long t-shirt and underwear
with her ageless legs for all to see, 
especially me, from my kitchen, as I waited then,
as I wait now, for my daughters’ tears
to come the way they do every Sunday evening
because we cut down their climbing tree
and tomorrow is a school day, and they don’t care
about the sky dropping pink and orange curtains
around the neighbor’s house, ending an opera
about a house that held a woman’s life
that some tomorrow will scrape down. "
His Steady Sails He Never Furls,"His steady sails he never furls
At any time o' year,
And perching now on Winter's curls,
He whistles in his ear"
"Time,","for Aya, September 2021
Be kind to her. She’s eleven & already
wants to turn you back. She wished this
after she squeezed a drop from her index
& read me the number. She always insists
I close my eyes & guess
what her blood is saying—
sometimes I’m wrong & sometimes not.
I kiss the tiny tears on her fingertips.
I kiss her arms & thighs before the insulin.
When I ask her to inject herself, I’m asking her to live
without me, & she knows it. When her legs trembled,
& I soothed with “I’m here, I’m here,”
she reminded me: “But you can’t do anything.”
Perhaps she meant “undo.”
Who am I kidding. Time, I demanded your undoing too,
that first night in the hospital before dawn,
when I woke up having forgotten, then remembered
where I was, what had happened.
The neon corridor light, the nurses’ chatter,
the potassium’s slow burn in my daughter’s vein.
Time, I know
I can’t reason with you. You go on and on.
Instead, I’m wishing her
astonishing slowness, softness
inside the arduous & unfair. Like this:
the dog’s limp, the cold coffee, the struggling
baby bougainvillea, the winged ant on the floor,
the half-eaten sandwich, the tenderness
of the 5am light, the daily departures,
the basil plant’s shadow on the wall,
& her hair, the swing of my love’s hair
as she runs, shaking her head
left & right, left & right,
how she always ran like this, always ran
as if swaying, No, No."
Mercy,"If you could ask the stars,
Those flickers that visit nightly,
They would tell you it wasn’t them
Who carved us from mud
To marvel at our opposable thumbs.
It wasn’t them who forfeited God
For a watch that didn’t work anyway.
It wasn’t them who sometimes denied
Us the living mirror we named love.
And still you look to them
For stories, for riddles, for answers
That they never possessed.
I’m not saying I’m better than you,
Far from it, if you find me here
Erecting the same elements
With these meager tools,
Wanting even now to give them life,
That they may look upon me with mercy.
I’ve been a prophet. I’ve been a fool."
V. Wukuada,"for Freddie Carlos Kweku “Pepper” Gray
 Wukuada 1989–Kwasiada 2015
Raheem tells the story best,
of how Freddie got his nickname.
              It was after football practice
              in the Pop Warner
peewee league. Freddie was the same
even back then, small as hell, quick too.
              Even quicker
              with his tongue.
During the last play of the scrimmage,
Freddie broke a 30-yard run, wiggled
              through 3 tackles, and used
              his signature spin-move
to sneak into the end-zone
for the score. He couldn’t stop
             jawing at all the players he’d juked.
             Especially, Chaz who froze
when Freddie put the spin on him.
Yo, Chaz, your uniform lookin’ extra wrinkled today.
             When you get home be sure to ask yo mama
             to put it through the spin-cycle. “Pepper.”
Cortez tells the story best of how Freddie
kept his nickname, “Pepper.” The dogdays of 2014
             had hit West Baltimore hard, fleecing
             the air with gummy gusts
from the Chesapeake. You could feel the brackish
mist tattooing your skin. Freddie had just
             finished working on his van, nursing
             the engine fan and coolant fluids.
He then heard the pied soundtrack of Mister Softee
     ‘round the corner, off of Lorraine and Greenmount.
         Just like that, kids gushed from Gilmor porches
                gunning to best their friends in line.
Freddie had had a good week. His van repairs, minimal. He
       politely waded through the brimming line. Smiling at the
incredulous looks from kids ready to condemn his breach of
                                         no-cutting-in-the-ice-cream-line decorum.
He smiled. Pulling a slim wad from his left pant-pocket. He
looked back to the eager patrons behind him and winked. He
whispered to the kid closest to him, what’s your favorite flavor?
         Satisfied with the response of Banana Twist,
he countered, Aight, I’ll grab it for ya, first tell me a joke.
Then the next kid, and the next, and just like that
         he purchased ice cream
         for the whole block: “Pepper.”"
I. Kwasiada,"for Trayvon Akwasi Benjamin Martin
 Kwasiada 1995–Kwasiada 2012
I name him Akwasi,
whom you also call Trayvon.
My week’s beginning,
my worship—
anointed, yellow, new.
My week begins with flight
because he prays to me
only: let me grow old enough
to be my own pilot, to fly my own skies.
Each night, I paint his
eyelid interiors cerulean and wisp.
He sees himself boarding
the latest Airbus A350
in crisp First Captain digs:
a deep navy coat and slacks,
overlain with bulbous gold buttons.
Three gold stripes on each shoulder
Three gold stripes on each sleeve.
His silver aviation wings are pinned
squarely; just left of a slim lapel,
above the crease of his breast-pocket,
along with a Jacksonville Jaguars pin,
because this year will finally be the year.
He nods to the head flight attendant
and gives his co-pilot a close-tuck dap,
before beginning the aircraft’s careen
along the runway.
The tenor and water of his south-Florida drawl
meld with the plane’s PA system like morninglight
mingled with dew: Ladies and gentlemen
this is your Captain speaking—
black boy pilot,
keeping black boy skies.
Even during turbulence
he measures the water
in each cloud.
Steer, measure, steer.
Titling heavy wings through
nesting cloud-water.
My week bleeds open
without its beginning."
Late Fermata,"On what would turn out to be Katie’s last good day
she asked to be wheeled outside & helped
into the Lazyboy her brother dragged out back
no one even bothering to remove the tag
from Costco that flapped, wild as a trapped bird 
before the wind surrendered
to a thin cardigan of mid-December sun
as all afternoon we watched
her sleeping while the sky hemorrhaged
quietly down & the small hills of dogshit
arranged along the graying cedar fence
did not blaze into anything
like golden stones, but her hair had grown
back a half inch or so & so glowed
in the last of that tinny glare
& if I thought briefly then of medieval manuscripts
where everyone important grows a halo
it wasn't quite like that either
although the bones of her face did appear
as if at low tide to surface
smooth as driftwood where the injured
bird might light in the moonlight, holding on
for some measures longer than expected."
The Dark Night (XVIII),"Our love is woven
Of a thousand strands—
The cool fragrance of the first lilac
At morning,
The first dew on the grass,
The smell of wild mint in the wood,
The pungent and earthy smell of ground ivy crushed under our feet;
Songs of birds, songs of great poets;
The leaping of the red squirrel in the tree,
The running of the river,
The commotion of stars and clouds in the high winds at night;
And dark stillness.
It is adorned with all the flowers
That stand in our garden;
It holds the night and the day.
Our love is made
Of the South Wind and the West Wind,
And the soft falling of rain;
Of white April evenings;
It is made of trees,
And of the many-coloured fields on the hills;
Of horizons,
Dark sea-blue of the west, thin sky-blue of the east,
With a yellow road between.
The flames of sunset and sunrise
Mingle in the fire of our love."
The Delinquent,"Goo'-by, Jinks, I got to hump,
Got to mek dis pony jump;
See dat sun a-goin' down
'N' me a-foolin' hyeah in town!
    Git up, Suke—go long!
Guess Mirandy'll think I's tight,
Me not home an' comin' on night.
What's dat stan'in' by de fence?
Pshaw! why don't I lu'n some sense?
    Git up, Suke—go long!
Guess I spent down dah at Jinks'
Mos' a dollah fur de drinks.
Bless yo'r soul, you see dat star?
Lawd, but won't Mirandy rar?
    Git up, Suke—go long!
Went dis mo'nin', hyeah it's night,
Dab's de cabin dah in sight.
Who's dat stan'in' in de do'?
Dat must be Mirandy, sho',
    Git up, Suke — go long!
Got de close-stick in huh han',

Hyeah, Mirandy, hyeah I come!
    Git up, Suke—go long!
Ef 't hadn't a be'n fur you, you slow ole fool, I'd a' be'n home long fo' now!"
A Summer's Night,"The night is dewy as a maiden's mouth,
    The skies are bright as are a maiden's eyes,
    Soft as a maiden's breath the wind that flies
Up from the perfumed bosom of the South.
Like sentinels, the pines stand in the park;
    And hither hastening, like rakes that roam,
    With lamps to light their wayward footsteps home,
The fireflies come stagg'ring down the dark."
October,"October is the treasurer of the year,
    And all the months pay bounty to her store;
The fields and orchards still their tribute bear,
    And fill her brimming coffers more and more
But she, with youthful lavishness,
    Spends all her wealth in gaudy dress,
And decks herself in garments bold
    Of scarlet, purple, red, and gold.
She heedeth not how swift the hours fly,
    But smiles and sings her happy life along;
She only sees above a shining sky;
    She only hears the breezes’ voice in song.
Her garments trail the woodlands through,
    And gather pearls of early dew
That sparkle, till the roguish Sun
    Creeps up and steals them every one.
But what cares she that jewels should be lost,
    When all of Nature’s bounteous wealth is hers?
Though princely fortunes may have been their cost,
    Not one regret her calm demeanor stirs.
Whole-hearted, happy, careless, free,
    She lives her life out joyously,
Nor cares when Frost stalks o’er her way
    And turns her auburn locks to gray."
Nora: A Serenade,"Ah, Nora, my Nora, the light fades away,
    While Night like a spirit steals up o'er the hills;
The thrush from his tree where he chanted all day,
    No longer his music in ecstasy trills.
Then, Nora, be near me; thy presence doth cheer me,
    Thine eye hath a gleam that is truer than gold.
I cannot but love thee; so do not reprove me,
    If the strength of my passion should make me too bold.
Nora, pride of my heart,—
    Rosy cheeks, cherry lips, sparkling with glee,—
Wake from thy slumbers, wherever thou art;
    Wake from thy slumbers to me.
Ah, Nora, my Nora, there's love in the air,—
    It stirs in the numbers that thrill in my brain;
Oh, sweet, sweet is love with its mingling of care,
    Though joy travels only a step before pain.
Be roused from thy slumbers and list to my numbers;
    My heart is poured out in this song unto thee.
Oh, be thou not cruel, thou treasure, thou jewel;
    Turn thine ear to my pleading and hearken to me."
A Coquette Conquered,"Yes, my ha't's ez ha'd ez stone—
Go 'way, Sam, an' lemme 'lone.
No; I ain't gwine change my min'—
Ain't gwine ma'y you—nuffin' de kin'.
Phiny loves you true an' deah?
Go ma'y Phiny; whut I keer?
Oh, you needn't mou'n an' cry—
I don't keer how soon you die.
Got a present! Whut you got?
Somef'n fu' de pan er pot!
Huh! Yo' sass do sholy beat—
Think I don't git 'nough to eat?
Whut's dat un'neaf yo' coat?
Looks des lak a little shoat.
'Tain't no possum? Bless de Lamb!
Yes, it is, you rascal, Sam!
Gin it to me; whut you say?
Ain't you sma't now! Oh, go 'way!
Possum do look mighty nice;
But you ax too big a price.
Tell me, is you talkin' true,
Dat's de gal's whut ma'ies you?
Come back, Sam; now whah's you gwine?
Co'se you knows dat possum's mine!"
Good-Night,"The lark is silent in his nest,
    The breeze is sighing in its flight,
Sleep, Love, and peaceful be thy rest.
    Good-night, my love, good-night, good-night.
Sweet dreams attend thee in thy sleep,
    To soothe thy rest till morning's light,
And angels round thee vigil keep.
    Good-night, my love, good-night, good-night.
Sleep well, my love, on night's dark breast,
    And ease thy soul with slumber bright;
Be joy but thine and I am blest.
    Good-night, my love, good-night, good-night."
He Had His Dream,"He had his dream, and all through life,
Worked up to it through toil and strife.
Afloat fore'er before his eyes,
It colored for him all his skies:
    The storm-cloud dark
    Above his bark,
The calm and listless vault of blue
Took on its hopeful hue,
It tinctured every passing beam—
    He had his dream.
He labored hard and failed at last,
His sails too weak to bear the blast,
The raging tempests tore away
And sent his beating bark astray.
    But what cared he
    For wind or sea!
He said, ""The tempest will be short,
My bark will come to port.""
He saw through every cloud a gleam—
    He had his dream."
Disappointed,"An old man planted and dug and tended,
    Toiling in joy from dew to dew;
The sun was kind, and the rain befriended;
    Fine grew his orchard and fair to view.
Then he said: 'I will quiet my thrifty fears,
For here is fruit for my failing years.'
But even then the storm-clouds gathered,
    Swallowing up the azure sky;
The sweeping winds into white foam lathered
    The placid breast of the bay, hard by;
Then the spirits that raged in the darkened air
Swept o'er his orchard and left it bare.
The old man stood in the rain, uncaring,
    Viewing the place the storm had swept;
And then with a cry from his soul despairing,
    He bowed him down to the earth and wept.
But a voice cried aloud from the driving rain;
""Arise, old man, and plant again!"""
A Corn-Song,"On the wide veranda white,
    In the purple failing light,
Sits the master while the sun is lowly burning;
And his dreamy thoughts are drowned
In the softly flowing sound
Of the corn-songs of the field-hands slow returning.
        Oh, we ho de co'n
        Since de ehly mo'n;
        Now de sinkin' sun
        Says de day is done.
O'er the fields with heavy tread,
Light of heart and high of head,
Though the halting steps be labored, slow, and weary;
Still the spirits brave and strong
Find a comforter in song,
And their corn-song rises ever loud and cheery.
        Oh, we ho de co'n
        Since de ehly mo'n;
        Now de sinkin' sun
        Says de day is done.
To the master in his seat,
    Comes the burden, full and sweet,
Of the mellow minor music growing clearer,
As the toilers raise the hymn,
Thro' the silence dusk and dim,
To the cabin's restful shelter drawing nearer.
        Oh, we ho de co'n
        Since de ehly mo'n;
        Now de sinkin' sun
        Says de day is done.
And a tear is in the eye
Of the master sitting by,
As he listens to the echoes low-replying
To the music's fading calls
As it faints away and falls
Into silence, deep within the cabin dying.
        Oh, we ho de co'n
        Since de ehly mo'n;
        Now de sinkin' sun
        Says de day is done."
Imperfect,"My native tongue doesn’t allow
imperfect tense, so it’s difficult
to say how something might used
to happen but no more. Elizabeth
used to walk among these trees.
She used to walk among these trees
but doesn’t anymore. Elizabeth
is no more though she used to be.
She doesn’t anymore but she used
to walk among these trees because
she used to be happy but only
for a short while before she descended
in despair. Elizabeth we could say
used to walk among these trees
because they made her happy.
Elizabeth used to be but no more."
Nine Spice Mix,"This spice mix is featured in many of the dishes in this book, lending them a uniquely Palestinian flavor.
 —Reem Kassis, The Palestinian Table
First they tango on my tongue,
nimble couples careening,
then together
form an Arab-style line dance
stepping, stomping, swaying.
West Indies allspice dazzles,
berries tangling with cinnamon sticks,
while cloves, Indonesian natives,
lead with a spirited solidarity solo.
Coriander seeds offer greetings in Hindi
as others toast comrades in languages
beyond borders and blockades.
Lifting up sisterhood, sun-wizened nutmeg
starts a sibling dance with mace.
Cumin demurs, then surprises
with subtle exultation.
Queen of spices cardamom,
host of the party, gives a nod to flavors
in hiding: lemony, sweet, warm, 
fragrant, nutty, pungent, hot.
Encouraged, feisty black peppercorns
shimmy center stage, organizing
the unique union of nine
for a vivacious global salute."

Gifts,"I kept my life in a small room
with pale blue walls
and brought it back
little presents from the world
This is for you I would say
This is for you
Sometimes the gifts
died in my hands
and often I could not pay
the price of their redemption
I could never be sure
they were appreciated or how much
they wanted to be in the place
where I had brought them
The room filled with less and less
space to breathe so instead of gifts
I began to bring stories
that did not end but slipped away
around corners and over horizons
I brought premonitions
and resistance to closure and left
at the end of each day
looking for more"
On Time,"His head’s a secret train-set in the attic:
quiet, straightforward, always summer.
The cattle in their fields of baize,
the postman on his bike,
the green sponge trees
by the papier-mâché tunnel, the children
forever waving their stiff handkerchiefs
at the trains that are always on time."
from “The Land”,"That was a spring of storms. They prowled the night;
Low level lightning flickered in the east
Continuous. The white pear-blossom gleamed
Motionless in the flashes; birds were still;
Darkness and silence knotted to suspense,
Riven by the premonitory glint
Of skulking storm, a giant that whirled a sword
Over the low horizon, and with tread
Earth-shaking ever threatened his approach,
But to delay his terror kept afar,
And held earth stayed in waiting like a beast
Bowed to receive a blow. But when he strode
Down from his throne of hills upon the plain,
And broke his anger to a thousand shards
Over the prostrate fields, then leapt the earth
Proud to accept his challenge; drank his rain;
Under his sudden wind tossed wild her trees;
Opened her secret bosom to his shafts;
The great drops spattered; then above the house
Crashed thunder, and the little wainscot shook
And the green garden in the lightning lay."
Discovered,"Seen you down at chu'ch las' night,
    Nevah min', Miss Lucy.
What I mean? oh, dat 's all right,

Comparison,"The sky of brightest gray seems dark
    To one whose sky was ever white.
To one who never knew a spark,
    Thro' all his life, of love or light,
    The grayest cloud seems over-bright.
The robin sounds a beggar's note
    Where one the nightingale has heard,
But he for whom no silver throat
    Its liquid music ever stirred,
    Deems robin still the sweetest bird."
The Change Has Come,"The change has come, and Helen sleeps—
Not sleeps; but wakes to greater deeps
    Of wisdom, glory, truth, and light,
    Than ever blessed her seeking sight,
    In this low, long, lethargic night,
        Worn out with strife
        Which men call life.
The change has come, and who would say
""I would it were not come to-day?""
    What were the respite till to-morrow?
    Postponement of a certain sorrow,
    From which each passing day would borrow!
        Let grief be dumb,
        The change has come."
Gone with the Swallows,"Must I convey at last the news to thee?
Must I now mourn the love that lived in me?
   Gone with the autumn, with the dying year.
   Gone with the kisses that are yet so near!
Gone with the swallows somewhere o’er the sea!
But with the Spring will he again
Return, will he with me remain?
       Must I till then, remembering naught,
       Forgetting all that love had brought,
   Grope in the shadows of the slain?
           Must I forget the day
           That took my love away,
               And all the happy hours
               That reared for him their towers
               And crowned him with the flowers
           Of all the queens of May?
           Must I alone
           My once my own,
              In my retreat
              The new year greet,
              And winter meet,
           And winds hear moan?
                Not yet
                   Can I
                Forget;
                   But why
                       One clings
                       And sings
                       To things
                   That die?"
The Aunty Poem (Mi Privilege Es Su Privilege),"I will be your aunty in the new city
where you have not yet met a soul
Come to my table and eat
Teach me your pronouns
I will be your aunty who wires you money
wherever you are stranded in this world
missed your bus your flight
When you’re passing through,
show me how to outline drama eyes like that
I will be your aunty with old-fashioned
button shirts and an ironing board
you can borrow for your interview
I will introduce you to whatever board members I know
Introduce me to your artist friends
You’ll make me look good at my next meeting
You can unfold my couch
Teach me golden hip moves
I will slip you any privilege I grasp
I am your aunty for life
Here are clean sheets,
and my spare key"
Divorce Song,"A man who is probably my husband sails by. 
But I just see a sailboat, not who steers it. 
But I picture a man, in the gender of things. 
My husband who you will not meet.
He’s off, I don’t know, marshalling.
Ideas, not soldiers. Sailing helps him think. 
I used to join him. Then we argued.
For a decade we argued. And sometimes 
sailed, though I was admittedly mostly 
decorative, a mermaid on the prow. 
Whether I brought him better luck 
is not my weather to tell. I cost him. 
Time. He costs me. More."
Ballad,"I Know my love is true,
    And oh the day is fair.
The sky is dear and blue,
The flowers are rich of hue,
    The air I breathe is rare,
    I have no grief or care;
For my own love is true,
    And oh the day is fair.
My love is false I find,
    And oh the day is dark.
Blows sadly down the wind,
While sorrow holds my mind;
    I do not hear the lark,
    For quenched is life's dear spark,—
My love is false I find,
    And oh the day is dark!
For love doth make the day
    Or dark or doubly bright;
Her beams along the way
Dispel the gloom and gray.
    She lives and all is bright,
    She dies and life is night.
For love doth make the day,
    Or dark or doubly bright. "
The Pact,"All those years—paw of again, paw of let’s go, 
of lake-plash, of come throw, perked ear
of what’s that? of yanked back who’s that?
unsettled pacer of storms, investigator of grass,
distinguished scholar of curbside, delighted
roller in the perfume of foul, sleek 
fetcher, sock chewer, under table sleeper,
taut leaper into air & pond—then, all at once,
it became her turn & the reliable 
body began—the unimaginable undoing; 
while we—scratchers of belly & ear, callers of hey, 
come back, diligent trainers of down & come,
companions of dawn, partners of rain,
& errand, stick throwers, ball wranglers, 
chair readers & nappers,
while at our feet with twitch & yelp,
she rustles through the high grass of dream—
understood it was now our turn, 
which meant—as it does with each animal sorrow
—doing the unimaginable."
Farnaz,"1. 
Our parents argued in a language 
we didn’t understand. We were born 
in Las Vegas or Teheran, 
twin cities of fantasy and chance. My 
sister and I found our words in Long 
Beach, Big Wheels and Barbies, 
Bluebird troops and kidnap breakfasts. 
A war forced our cousins 
to buy false passports, lose their savings. 
We ate Chef Boyardee after school, 
hot spinach and meatball soup 
on the weekends. I yelled into a phone 
so my Iranian family could hear 
me. I learned I was the silk carpet 
my mother didn’t own, the casino 
payout my father kept chasing. 
I didn’t know until later 
the Persian Leopard was trapped 
in the Zagros mountains after 
the Iran-Iraq war, in danger 
of tripping old mines. 
2. 
I taught myself who I was 
by watching my sister carefully.  
I worried when  
the day came and I wanted 
to say I’m not her. First out the womb,  
she was named and I wasn’t.  
Her name is Iranian but sayable  
by everyone. My name 
would wait. They waited until 
they knew they had it right. 
Not Sheila, my mother’s veto. 
Farnaz, a name that made me lonely.  
We lived in between Iran 
and America, a customs declaration zone.
By the time I was born 
my mute parents wondered 
how to speak as Americans 
as they moved away 
from the people who loved them. 
How could I know the dark 
inside their mouths hurt them, too. 
3. 
My father studied numbers in the racing 
forms, and I bet following my gut. 
I influenced dice at the craps table 
by spinning three times  
in each direction while my father  
placed his bets. Even now, 
I’ll retell stories in my head 
one hundred times to end them right.  
It’s a system.  
I came from the racetrack, ignoring  
all the horses in the flesh. I sounded out  
the names of long shots.  
The odds say Blinding Telegram 
will win, but I like the music 
of Queen the Fox. 
I believed that how I got my name would mean 
something. I am still finding the names for some things: 
the youth my parents brought to parenting, the attention 
I didn’t know I was waiting for, the word for wanting, 
feeling its deep hole. Such naming 
I have been slow to do. I am waiting until I have it right. 
I know that once named there is a road 
down which that named thing runs, 
and I am not the one who built the road. "
The Wooing,"A Youth went faring up and down,
    Alack and well-a-day.
He fared him to the market town,
    Alack and well-a-day.
And there he met a maiden fair,
With hazel eyes and auburn hair;
His heart went from him then and there,
    Alack and well-a-day.
She posies sold right merrily,
    Alack and well-a-day;
But not a flower was fair as she,
    Alack and well-a-day.
He bought a rose and sighed a sigh,
“Ah, dearest maiden, would that I
Might dare the seller too to buy!”
    Alack and well-a-day.
She tossed her head, the coy coquette,
    Alack and well-a-day.
“I'm not, sir, in the market yet,”
    Alack and well-a-day.
“Your love must cool upon a shelf;
Tho' much I sell for gold and pelf,
I'm yet too young to sell myself,”
    Alack and well-a-day.
The youth was filled with sorrow sore,
    Alack and well-a-day;
And looked he at the maid once more,
    Alack and well-a-day.
Then loud he cried, “Fair maiden, if
Too young to sell, now as I live,
You're not too young yourself to give,”
    Alack and well-a-day.
The little maid cast down her eyes,
    Alack and well-a-day,
And many a flush began to rise,
    Alack and well-a-day.
“Why, since you are so bold,' she said,
“I doubt not you are highly bred,
So take me!"" and the twain were wed,
    Alack and well-a-day."
Melancholia,"Silently without my window,
    Tapping gently at the pane,
    Falls the rain.
Through the trees sighs the breeze
    Like a soul in pain.
Here alone I sit and weep;
Thought hath banished sleep.
Wearily I sit and listen
    To the water's ceaseless drip.
    To my lip
Fate turns up the bitter cup,
    Forcing me to sip;
'Tis a bitter, bitter drink,
Thus I sit and think,—
Thinking things unknown and awful,
    Thoughts on wild, uncanny themes,
    Waking dreams.
Spectres dark, corpses stark,
    Show the gaping seams
Whence the cold and cruel knife
Stole away their life.
Bloodshot eyes all strained and staring,
    Gazing ghastly into mine;
    Blood like wine
On the brow—clotted now—
    Shows death's dreadful sign.
Lonely vigil still I keep;
Would that I might sleep!
Still, oh, still, my brain is whirling!
    Still runs on my stream of thought;
    I am caught
In the net fate hath set.
    Mind and soul are brought
To destruction's very brink;
Yet I can but think!
Eyes that look into the future, —
    Peeping forth from out my mind,
    They will find
Some new weight, soon or late,
On my soul to bind,
Crushing all its courage out,—
Heavier than doubt.
Dawn, the Eastern monarch's daughter,
    Rising from her dewy bed,
    Lays her head
'Gainst the clouds' sombre shrouds
    Now half fringed with red.
O'er the land she 'gins to peep;
Come, O gentle Sleep!
Hark! the morning cock is crowing;
    Dreams, like ghosts, must hie away;
    'Tis the day.
Rosy morn now is born;
    Dark thoughts may not stay.
Day my brain from foes will keep;
Now, my soul, I sleep."
My Local Dead,"This was the time of year we would go into the frozen forest—
leaves stripped, only a few birds ticking in the bare trees, fields shorn,
corn trash a dull gold. Sometimes snow would fall, and I can recall
the exact sound of its muffling, quieting whiteness crackling down. 
Of our hunting party, only two of us are alive—
grandparents long dead, father and nephew dead, their bones
all on the ridge top with the others. The town is shabbier now,
middle classes disappeared, leaving the ancient, the angry and the slow.
My cousin is returning home—to a place he reviled—
having run out his luck in the West. His plan 
is to move into the garage on the old homestead, which of course
is no plan at all. I sometimes hear the call to return,
come back to the shady valley with its reliable breeze, 
the crumbling brindle bluffs, a brandy old fashioned made with 7UP
waiting for me on the sticky bar of the Golden Frog, 
recognition registering with those I meet when they see
my father looking back from inside my aging face. That place
don’t fade—the one that made me—bone isotopes belie 
the soil’s iron and chalk, my talk inflected (sorry sounds like sore).
What’s more is that I want to go, but won’t.  
I’ll stay here, 2000 miles away, amidst an older Eastern decay.
It turns out I have some local dead here as well: 
Fifth Great-Grandfather Christian Servoss—colonial Dutchman
from the Palatine, who died in some wintertime foolishness 
crossing the frozen Mohawk. His two boys watched him 
and his horses drown in that not-very-impressive watercourse. 
One of those boys made it to Iowa, and disappeared,
but not before he reproduced, becoming Fourth Great-Grandfather
to yours truly, and so on. My remaining colonial dead 
lie in the dirt near Palatine Bridge, their names effaced 
from marble by acid rain. I wish I didn’t care about them, but I do.
It matters to have this ghost clan near—this family I never knew."
The Spring Has Many Silences,"The spring has many sounds:
Roller skates grind the pavement to noisy dust.
Birds chop the still air into small melodies.
The wind forgets to be the weather for a time
And whispers old advice for summer.
The sea stretches itself
And gently creaks and cracks its bones….

The spring has many silences:
Buds are mysteriously unbound
With a discreet significance,
And buds say nothing.
There are things that even the wind will not betray.
Earth puts her finger to her lips
And muffles there her quiet, quick activity….
Do not wonder at me
That I am hushed
This April night beside you.
The spring has many silences."
Everything repeats itself in the creases,"Everything repeats itself in the creases 
of this exhaustible  
history stolen  
some time ago 
I hope that it lasts more than a year  
this twisted will  
Let it not succumb  
to the forgetfulness  
of the step taken before and miss 
Eyes the flowers and veils  
with which I cover myself
I hope  
it lasts while it lasts  
the certainty  
of this sky  
poured and yellow struck 
    Todo se repite en los dobleces
de esta agotable 
historia hurtada 
hace ya algún tiempo 
Espero que dure más de un año
esta voluntad torcida 
Que no sucumba

Desmembrando cuerpos
con suntuosas verdades
amarillas

Como quien va

The dry breath,"The dry breath

ivy nights

everyone goes at their own pace

an irrevocable fear 
We all share  
a fragile hunger’s body 
We all share but you do not  
share yourself with me even if I want you to  
or because of it  
Some day we will know if it’s true  
that the ground withholds our steps

noches en hiebra

In which stone was traced,"In which stone was traced

What if something was dusk 
What tremendous shriek 
was behind the mirror

Also to cry if it’s known 
all about assumed feats  
To peel the scab 
obliged to the bone 
To pretend a circle’s  
divine perfection 
that gathers it all up 
with imperfect movements  
To dig my grave deep 
without knowing 
the truth of the pretext

The Ol' Tunes,"You kin talk about yer anthems
    An' yer arias an' sich,
An' yer modern choir-singin'
    That you think so awful rich;
But you orter heerd us youngsters
    In the times now far away,
A-singin' o' the ol' tunes
    In the ol'-fashioned way.
There was some of us sung treble
    An' a few of us growled bass,
An' the tide o' song flowed smoothly
    With its 'comp'niment o' grace;
There was spirit in that music,
    An' a kind o' solemn sway,
A-singin' o' the ol' tunes
    In the ol'-fashioned way.
I remember oft o' standin'
    In my homespun pantaloons—
On my face the bronze an' freckles
    O' the suns o' youthful Junes—
Thinkin' that no mortal minstrel
    Ever chanted sich a lay
As the ol' tunes we was singin'
    In the ol'-fashioned way.
The boys 'ud always lead, us,
    An' the girls 'ud all chime in,
Till the sweetness o' the singin'
    Robbed the list'nin' soul o' sin;
An' I used to tell the parson
    'Twas as good to sing as pray,
When the people sung the ol' tunes
    In the ol'-fashioned way.
How I long ag'in to hear 'em
    Pourin' forth from soul to soul,
With the treble high an' meller,
    An' the bass's mighty roll;
But the times is very diff'rent,
    An' the music heerd to-day
Ain't the singin' o' the ol' tunes
    In the ol'-fashioned way.
Little screechin' by a woman,
    Little squawkin' by a man,
Then the organ's twiddle-twaddle,
    Jest the empty space to span, —
An' ef you should even think it,
    'T isn't proper fur to say
That you want to hear the ol' tunes
    In the ol'-fashioned way.
But I think that some bright mornin',
    When the toils of life air o'er,
An' the sun o' heaven arisin'
    Glads with light the happy shore,
I shall hear the angel chorus,
    In the realms of endless day,
A-singin' o' the ol' tunes
    In the ol'-fashioned way."
After While,"A Poem Of Faith
I think that though the clouds be dark,
That though the waves dash o'er the bark.
Yet after while the light will come,
And in calm waters safe at home
The bark will anchor.
Weep not, my sad-eyed, gray-robed maid.
Because your fairest blossoms fade,
That sorrow still o'erruns your cup,
And even though you root them up,
            The weeds grow ranker.
For after while your tears shall cease,
And sorrow shall give way to peace;
The flowers shall bloom, the weeds shall die,
And in that faith seen, by and by
Thy woes shall perish.
Smile at old Fortune's adverse tide,
Smile when the scoffers sneer and chide.
Oh, not for you the gems that pale,
And not for you the flowers that fail;
            Let this thought cherish:
That after while the clouds will part,
And then with joy the waiting heart
Shall feel the light come stealing in,
That drives away the cloud of sin
And breaks its power.
And you shall burst your chrysalis,
And wing away to realms of bliss,
Untrammelled, pure, divinely free,
Above all earth's anxiety
            From that same hour."
Nature and Art,"To My Friend Charles Booth Nettleton
I
The young queen Nature, ever sweet and fair,
    Once on a time fell upon evil days.
    From hearing oft herself discussed with praise,
There grew within her heart the longing rare
To see herself; and every passing air
    The warm desire fanned into lusty blaze.
    Full oft she sought this end by devious ways,
But sought in vain, so fell she in despair,
For none within her train nor by her side
    Could solve the task or give the envied boon.
    So day and night, beneath the sun and moon,
She wandered to and fro unsatisfied,
    Till Art came by, a blithe inventive elf,
    And made a glass wherein she saw herself.
II
Enrapt, the queen gazed on her glorious self,
    Then trembling with the thrill of sudden thought,
    Commanded that the skilful wight be brought
That she might dower him with lands and pelf.
Then out upon the silent sea-lapt shelf
    And up the hills and on the downs they sought
    Him who so well and wondrously had wrought;
And with much search found and brought home the elf.
    But he put by all gifts with sad replies,
And from his lips these words flowed forth like wine:
    ""O queen, I want no gift but thee,"" he said.
She heard and looked on him with love-lit eyes,
Gave him her hand, low murmuring, ""I am thine,""
    And at the morrow's dawning they were wed."
Eclipse Season,"after Iris Cushing
There is no empire in nerve. 
When I come home, I roam the map. 
My cursor lands on Truth or Consequences, 
and I read facts about Titanic till I’m blue. 
When I come home I’ve roamed the map. 
I tell my love what I have done Wyoming. 
The facts stack up titanic and I blue.
I don’t know what I love now, he tells me. 
I’ve done it, told my love Wyoming. 
Bit the corner off a dumpling before cooking. 
I don’t know if I love you, I should say.  
I want to see if there’s a mark left later. 
I bit the corner off this dumb thing. 
What was left behind and then uncovered? 
I want to see the mark that I felt later. 
When I got home my love was thinned obscure. 
Left behind and then uncovered, 
by noon the moon had taken the blue stage. 
My homeland, love, has been obscured, smeared
into surrounding states. Grass was growing greener. 
By two the moon had exited the stage. 
I preen into my screen and blue but I am gone. 
Grass was growing green where I should be,
bared beneath the briefly darkening desert. 
I preen into a blue screen where I’ve gone, 
a darkened noon, Wyoming under shadow,  
briefly spared beneath the blackening desert, 
an earth threaded with crescent meaning. 
At noon Wyoming slides from under shadow. 
I want to pull the fabric back, to see the other cloth. 
The threads I tend with meaning: 
dirt on my head, I should die, I would say. 
I pulled the fabric back and saw the other cloth. 
Beneath us is a net of empire sewn with nerve. 
Dirt in my mouth, I will die. 
I asked you for your weather, then your liver."
The Colored Soldiers,"If the muse were mine to tempt it
    And my feeble voice were strong,
If my tongue were trained to measures,
    I would sing a stirring song.
I would sing a song heroic
    Of those noble sons of Ham,
Of the gallant colored soldiers
    Who fought for Uncle Sam!
In the early days you scorned them,
    And with many a flip and flout
Said ""These battles are the white man's,
    And the whites will fight them out.""
Up the hills you fought and faltered,
    In the vales you strove and bled,
While your ears still heard the thunder
    Of the foes' advancing tread.
Then distress fell on the nation,
    And the flag was drooping low;
Should the dust pollute your banner?
    No! the nation shouted, No!
So when War, in savage triumph,
    Spread abroad his funeral pall—
Then you called the colored soldiers,
    And they answered to your call.
And like hounds unleashed and eager
    For the life blood of the prey,
Spring they forth and bore them bravely
    In the thickest of the fray.
And where'er the fight was hottest,
    Where the bullets fastest fell,
There they pressed unblanched and fearless
    At the very mouth of hell.
Ah, they rallied to the standard
    To uphold it by their might;
None were stronger in the labors,
    None were braver in the fight.
From the blazing breach of Wagner
    To the plains of Olustee,
They were foremost in the fight
    Of the battles of the free.
And at Pillow! God have mercy
    On the deeds committed there,
And the souls of those poor victims
    Sent to Thee without a prayer.
Let the fulness of Thy pity
    O'er the hot wrought spirits sway
Of the gallant colored soldiers
    Who fell fighting on that day!
Yes, the Blacks enjoy their freedom,
    And they won it dearly, too;
For the life blood of their thousands
    Did the southern fields bedew.
In the darkness of their bondage,
    In the depths of slavery's night,
Their muskets flashed the dawning,
    And they fought their way to light.
They were comrades then and brothers.
    Are they more or less to-day?
They were good to stop a bullet
    And to front the fearful fray.
They were citizens and soldiers,
    When rebellion raised its head;
And the traits that made them worthy,—
    Ah! those virtues are not dead.
They have shared your nightly vigils,
    They have shared your daily toil;
And their blood with yours commingling
    Has enriched the Southern soil.
They have slept and marched and suffered
    'Neath the same dark skies as you,
They have met as fierce a foeman,
    And have been as brave and true.
And their deeds shall find a record
    In the registry of Fame;
For their blood has cleansed completely
    Every blot of Slavery's shame.
So all honor and all glory
    To those noble sons of Ham—
The gallant colored soldiers
    Who fought for Uncle Sam!"
The Dilettante: A Modern Type,"He scribbles some in prose and verse,
    And now and then he prints it;
He paints a little, — gathers some
    Of Nature's gold and mints it.
He plays a little, sings a song,
    Acts tragic roles, or funny;
He does, because his love is strong,
    But not, oh, not for money!
He studies almost everything
    From social art to science;
A thirsty mind, a flowing spring,
    Demand and swift compliance.
He looms above the sordid crowd—
    At least through friendly lenses;
While his mamma looks pleased and proud,
    And kindly pays expenses."
An Easy-Goin’ Feller,"Ther' ain't no use in all this strife,
An' hurryin', pell-mell, right thro' life.
I don't believe in goin' too fast
To see what kind o' road you've passed.
It ain't no mortal kind o' good,
'N' I would n't hurry ef I could.
I like to jest go joggin' 'long,
To limber up my soul with song;
To stop awhile 'n' chat the men,
'N' drink some cider now an' then.
Do' want no boss a-standin' by
To see me work; I allus try
To do my dooty right straight up,
An' earn what fills my plate an' cup.
An' ez fur boss, I'll be my own,
I like to jest be let alone,
To plough my strip an' tend my bees,
An' do jest like I doggoned please.
My head's all right, an' my heart's meller,
But I'm a easy-goin' feller."
At the Spring Dawn,"I watched the dawn come,
    Watched the spring dawn come.
And the red sun shouldered his way up
    Through the grey, through the blue,
Through the lilac mists.
The quiet of it! The goodness of it!
    And one bird awoke, sang, whirred
A blur of moving black against the sun,
    Sang again—afar off.
And I stretched my arms to the redness of the sun,
    Stretched to my finger tips,
        And I laughed.
Ah! It is good to be alive, good to love,
    At the dawn,
        At the spring dawn."
We Dream The Dreams Dreaming Us,"You say we should wait— 
It must have snowed all night or season,  
  we don’t seem to know  
and there isn’t a clock; 
  I say then  
  we should  
  wait, I  
trust you. 
  The white page is blank outside;  
we haven’t heard in days. 
There is not enough time for a whole new plot. 
  Inside, the wax dilates  
wide around the candle.
  We sit in the dark
and wait
  and are separate,
  but looking at each other—"
Ghosts,"A hallway full of shadeless lamps suddenly goes dark
Upon the simultaneous bursting of the globes.
Glass is everywhere, and so thin it forgets
To reflect even the tiny glimmer of your
Matchlight as you pull out your wish 
Cigarette. 
This is it. The immediacy of the final desire.
I know the dead I know where ghosts go
to feel at home in the float
And how they commune with the living
through the lightswitch 
or the smells of honeysuckles off 
the highway upstate
I say
But you don’t"
In Safranbolu,"The evening I left, I went for a wash
In the neighborhood hammam. Lifted my dress.
Entered the water, which moved in rings
From me as though from a stranger, took a stick
To strip a layer of my old back.
In my bag lay a box of Turkish Delight
Meant for my parents, a book of notes, a passport
But I was holding nothing now as I floated
In pools upon pools of ancient tiled rooms.
There was a pigeon in an alcove making song,
Women in the shadows clucking disapprovingly
At me, unmarried and brazen
And free, in the windows a kind of violet smoke
I understood as twilight taking over the sky.
However hard I tried to erase the blot
My body kept bobbing back up.
I thought that’s what time was, you couldn’t lose it
Like a stone in water, that having been
Myself so long it would be forever.
And now Safranbolu doesn’t exist anymore,
At least not the one where my father
Still has years on the clock,
Where my mother’s unreason hasn’t begun,
The babies not sprung yet from their wherever,
City rich off spice, flame-colored threads of the crocus
That flowers on the hills around like blue light,
Whose gates I will pass through only in the mind:
When I slipped on my dress and reopened the door
Night had closed over the world that I knew."
Black Lead in a Nancy Meyers Film,"Aging, at all. I want that. And to fall
perhaps most honestly in love
beside the ocean, in a home I’ve paid
for by doing as I like: drinking good
wine, dusting sugar over a croissant, or
the stage play I’m writing myself into.
Aging Black woman in neutral summer
turtleneck. Known. And jogging. Lonesome
enough. Eating homemade lavender
ice cream, the moon blooming
through the kitchen window. The distant
sound of waves. Learning
French as a second language.
Votre pâte merveilleux, I smile back.
And then, just like that! Falling, cautiously,
for my busy, middle-aged lover,
who needs me, but has never truly seen me
until now. Our Black friends, celebrating
with hors d’oeuvres. Our Black children
growing older."
Lion,"I chewed into the wreck of the world,
into the neckbone of the past that pursued me.
All the while, I moved toward extinction,
bearing the burden of damage, language of the protector.
A great apocalyptic wheeze adorned me with sand. 
I foraged, first to find light dappling the leaves,
then breathed into an infinite power, feminine rust,
a coppery taste of salvage, leading me into a canopy
of the future. My mother was a mother of mothers,
modern before she was ancestral.
She was a woman who morphed into feline, back
to her human self before I woke each morning.
I lived not to sate my appetite but to crush it.
On my haunches, I craved what could not be seen.
I am desire. I am survival.
I sit under the tree waiting for hunger."
Pastoral,"A frog leaps out across the lawn,
And crouches there—all heavy and alone,
And like a blossom, pale and over-blown,
Once more the moon turns dim against the dawn.
Crawling across the straggling panoply
Of little roses, only half in bloom,
It strides within that beamed and lofty room
Where an ebon stallion looms upon the hay.
The stillness moves, and seems to grow immense,
A shuddering dog starts, dragging at its chain,
Thin, dusty rats slink down within the grain,
And in the vale the first far bells commence.
Here in the dawn, with mournful doomèd eyes
A cow uprises, moving out to bear
A soft-lipped calf with swarthy birth-swirled hair,
And wide wet mouth, and droll uncertainties.
The grey fowls fight for places in the sun,
The mushrooms flare, and pass like painted fans:
All the world is patient in its plans—
The seasons move forever, one on one.
Small birds lie sprawling vaguely in the heat,
And wanly pluck at shadows on their breasts,
And where the heavy grape-vine leans and rests,
White butterflies lift up their furry feet.
The wheat grows querulous with unseen cats;
A fox strides out in anger through the corn,
Bidding each acre wake and rise to mourn
Beneath its sharps and through its throaty flats.
And so it is, and will be year on year,
Time in and out of date, and still on time
A billion grapes plunge bleeding into wine
And bursting, fall like music on the ear.
The snail that marks the girth of night with slime,
The lonely adder hissing in the fern,
The lizard with its ochre eyes aburn—
Each is before, and each behind its time."
A Border Ballad,"Oh, I haven't got long to live, for we all
    Die soon, e'en those who live longest;
And the poorest and weakest are taking their chance
    Along with the richest and strongest.
So it's heigho for a glass and a song,
    And a bright eye over the table,
And a dog for the hunt when the game is flush.
    And the pick of a gentleman's stable.
There is Dimmock o' Dune, he was here yester-night,
    But he's rotting to-day on Glen Arragh;
'Twas the hand o' MacPherson that gave him the blow,
    And the vultures shall feast on his marrow.
But it's heigho for a brave old song
    And a glass while we are able;
Here's a health to death and another cup
    To the bright eye over the table.
I can show a broad back and a jolly deep chest,
    But who argues now on appearance?
A blow or a thrust or a stumble at best
    May send me to-day to my clearance.
Then it's heigho for the things I love,
    My mother'll be soon wearing sable,
But give me my horse and my dog and my glass,
    And a bright eye over the table."
Columbian Ode,"I.
Four hundred years ago a tangled waste
   Lay sleeping on the west Atlantic's side;
Their devious ways the Old World's millions traced
   Content, and loved, and labored, dared and died.
While students still believed the charts they conned,
   And revelled in their thriftless ignorance,
Nor dreamed of other lands that lay beyond
   Old Ocean's dense, indefinite expanse.
II.
But deep within her heart old Nature knew
   That she had once arrayed, at Earth's behest,
Another offspring, fine and fair to view,—
   The chosen suckling of the mother's breast.
The child was wrapped in vestments soft and fine,
   Each fold a work of Nature's matchless art;
The mother looked on it with love divine,
   And strained the loved one closely to her heart.
And there it lay, and with the warmth grew strong
   And hearty, by the salt sea breezes fanned,
Till Time with mellowing touches passed along,
   And changed the infant to a mighty land.
III.
But men knew naught of this, till there arose
   That mighty mariner, the Genoese,
Who dared to try, in spite of fears and foes,
   The unknown fortunes of unsounded seas.
O noblest of Italia's sons, thy bark
   Went not alone into that shrouding night!
O dauntless darer of the rayless dark,
   The world sailed with thee to eternal light!
The deer-haunts that with game were crowded then
   To-day are tilled and cultivated lands;
The schoolhouse tow'rs where Bruin had his den,
   And where the wigwam stood the chapel stands;
The place that nurtured men of savage mien
   Now teems with men of Nature's noblest types;
Where moved the forest-foliage banner green,
   Now flutters in the breeze the stars and stripes!"
Night of Love,"The moon has left the sky, love,
    The stars are hiding now,
And frowning on the world, love,
    Night bares her sable brow.
The snow is on the ground, love,
    And cold and keen the air is.
I'm singing here to you, love;
    You're dreaming there in Paris.
But this is Nature's law, love,
    Though just it may not seem,
That men should wake to sing, love;
    While maidens sleep and dream.
Them care may not molest, love,
    Nor stir them from their slumbers,
Though midnight find the swain, love.
    Still halting o'er his numbers.
I watch the rosy dawn, love,
    Come stealing up the east,
While all things round rejoice, love,
    That Night her reign has ceased.
The lark will soon be heard, love,
    And on his way be winging;
When Nature's poets wake, love,
    Why should a man be singing?"
Opening at Town Shores,"From a drone 
The man-made waterways 
Spread out their fingers 
A sailboat sputters
Past humdrum condominiums
Toward the mouth 
Of Boca Ciega Bay 
The old Mercury puffs 
A few thick clouds 
Before it stalls 
Then a lull 
The timing near perfect: 
The wind billows the sails
Full sail ahead 
The ageless current 
That drives the air 
That stirs the water 
And moves the hull 
Toward the sea moves me 
And causes my fingers 
To move across the page 
The drone zooms in to showcase the pool 
As it juts into a widening channel
The area deserted 
Except for an old man near the water’s edge 
He is regally robed and safari helmeted 
Sitting and writing 
In the cage of his red-wheeled walker 
It is summer in Florida
He interrupts himself to look around 
Then goes back to taking notes 
On the secret life of plants 
Zoom in closer:
I am that man
I open myself to the silence 
There’s enough of it here 
To hear the tiniest of wings 
Not the drone taking 
Wing from MacDill Air Base 
But the sound of a frail creature 
Swollen with pollen 
Toiling to hold itself up 
In the empty air
Waiting with grace 
For the fall 
The inevitable splash 
In that same instant 
Sun sparklers trawl their nets 
Across the surface 
To catch this quiet 
How could I have missed it? 
Something sacred was about to land 
Swimmers invade the pool 
Instead of swimming they stand 
In the water or move a limb 
Talk of tai chi and yoga 
And cancer and catheters 
A father with Alzheimer’s 
A neighbor’s lingering terminal illness
A death 
For a few seconds all is quiet 
Maybe too quiet 
The air begins to cloy 
With baby oil and iodine 
A professor whose gray hair is braided 
Announces that the spirit
Must be grounded in light 
Another interrupts her 
With The Power of Now
Soon all is aflutter 
The sounds distant and nonsensical 
As the chirping of birds
What they leave behind 
Is stillness so maddening 
The shrill lawnmower 
Is welcome noise 
Stillness then 
Is not the absence of sound 
And loveliness not always a flower 
Unless I see it for the first time 
How the filaments in the center 
Thinner than paper 
Aspire upward 
Opening 
Never preening 
And when its time has come 
A petal does not mind drying 
Never minds 
Falling 
Under the nose 
Of a mechanical owl 
And barrier fishing lines 
Two Florida sparrows land
To gulp water 
Splash one another 
And spur the moment to frolic 
One flies away 
The other looks on
The slight wings beating the water 
To drown its sorrow
Before it too flies off
In the same direction
Stillness is not 
Always the lack of motion 
The birds were not nervous 
When they gave themselves 
Over to doing what they do 
They have flown beyond artificial nets 
Even ceremonial doves 
Defy formation without 
Fretting about falling 
Or bettering their last 
Audition
On the Tiki hut 
A palm frond loses its footing 
The vertical drop 
Fans into a swan dive 
Still it misses the water 
And scrapes along the pool’s edge 
Waiting to be airborne again 
In the shadow 
Of a sundial 
A caterpillar plant comes to life 
Breakdancing to a sudden gust 
The stem shivers and little hairs 
Thin and fall 
Into transparence 
In the whitening sun 
Each floats on air 
To its own rhythm 
Its own 
Stylized breaking crawl 
The mower cuts all that have landed 
In its path into finer filigree 
To be airlifted or sprayed 
Into green water 
And carried out colorless 
As they reach the sea 
They are as much a part of the great 
Current as the dancing seahorse 
The feather star 
Or the rainbow anemone 
What was dander in the grass 
Is now a great spirit 
More brilliant in its sheerness 
Than the oleander 
The pool light comes on underwater 
I watch the lightshow on the bottom 
Lace curtains dance in and out of focus 
And shudder at the slightest touch
A single breath from me sets off ripples 
Changing the mesh of an entire universe 
Each pattern more intricate than the last 
As sound waves translate 
Into shape-shifting 
Fractals of light
I keep blowing on the surface 
Mesmerized by zebras crawling 
Down my leg
The shifting lines continue to drill 
Their spiraling illusions
Right through the concrete
To the underside of life
All I do is to poke
A finger in the water and—voila! 
A diaphanous mandala 
Alive and billowing 
Spreads out and downward
And starts to gel
In the viscous slow motion 
Of a lava lamp overflowing
To an underground river 
And an endless formless
Waxen ocean 
 The submarine light 
Insinuates itself through 
The murky green of night vision 
Into the very treacle of the sea 
And what unfolds before the eye 
Is an undulating breathing 
Undiscovered yet familiar 
—opening— 
Forming and reforming 
In fleeting time-lapse 
Corals becoming reefs becoming
An island of coral 
The runway of the landing 
As I tread way 
Into the secret life of the jungle 
Leaves waver
Dry and yellow 
Into haystacks of old Europe 
Changing in shape and color 
Into towers of Cholla cactuses
Teepee huts crowned with 
The feathers of raised spirits
Images of burial mounds
Subterranean pyramids 
Glowing embers red and volcanic 
Burst and spatter 
Every edifice cornice and porous 
Surface of concrete jungle 
With a riotous magma of color
Melting and molding
Every molecule
Into sacred geometry
Gecko gargoyles mechanical owls 
A razor-sharp sunburst 
Appear in glaring colors
To scare off buzzards unwanted 
Solicitors and all other bloodsuckers
That impersonate time 
From the Kenmore to Embassy row 
Condominiums raise 
Their sacred totems 
To the beat of Tocobaga drums 
An ancient wind instrument 
Billows the sails 
And makes the fingers of water tremble 
Artists bricklayers dragon slayers 
Sailors and whistling minstrels 
Woman warriors
Weary from battles for their 
Own secret heart 
Every grain of sand 
Blown here from distant shores 
Every brush and crush of petal 
Filament of flower sundial and owl 
An animate and timeless 
Sacrament of grace"
Mnemonic: ᎠᏓᏁᏗ/Adanedi/Gift,"The day after we make love each movement amplifies, ricochets through me.
My right femur might break free from hip. My left shoulder muscle catches scapula.
Pectorals smolder red-orange from the fire in my abdomen. My ankle grinds itself to fine white dust
But the kink in my
wrist reminds me of
fumbling at your belt. 
The cramp in my jaw
of our frantic kisses.
Tension
in my neck, your dark
nipple erect
and delicious. The burning
in my hip sockets your
tongue’s pelvic
journey. My throat
sore from inhaling our
heat. The pang in my
ear where you
whispered
I love you.
And I am grateful for the glyphs sickness carves
on my spine, for the story pain paints
on my body’s cavern walls, for this body
holding you the day after.
For this
body
refusing
to forget."
Mnemonic: ᎠᎩᏲᏟ/Agiyotli/Pain,"Generations of strain and exhaustion
collide into my body.  Residue of small pox
scratches my throat.  The story too painful to
tell your daughter
surfaces now in my shoulder blades.
What were you forced to carry when all you wanted was one moment of rest?
Memories you promised not to pass on
knot themselves, a nest of copperheads in my neck.
Every step you took sparks my nerves.
Muscles ache from the work of survival.
Pain—The shadow left.
                        Settling dust of forced marches.
                                                 The handmark of history.
Is my body the bruise left
after the impact of your life?"
Portrait of My Gender as [Inaudible],"I knew I was a god
when you could not
agree on my name
& still, none you spoke
could force me to listen
closer. Is this the nothing
the antelope felt when
Adam, lit on his own
entitling, dubbed family,
genus, species? So many
descendants became
doctors, delivered
babies, bestowed bodies
names as if to say it is to make it
so. Can it be a comfort between
us, the fact of my creation?
I was made in the image
of a thing without
an image & silence, too,
is your invention. Who prays
for a god except to appear
with answers, but never
a body? A voice? If I told you
you wouldn’t believe me
because I was the one
to say it. On the first day
there was no sound
worth mentioning. If  I, too,
am a conductor of air, the only
praise I know is in stereo
(one pair—an open hand & closed
fist—will have to do). I made
a photograph of my name:
there was a shadow in a field
& I put my shadow in it. You
can’t hear me, but I’m there."
Day-Dreams,"We’d build a little bungalow,
If you and I were one,
And carefully we’d plan it, so
We’d get the morning sun.
I’d rise each day at rosy dawn
And bustle gaily down;
In evening’s cool, you’d spray the lawn
When you came back from town.
A little cook-book I should buy,
Your dishes I’d prepare;
And though they came out black and dry,
I know you wouldn’t care.
How valiantly I’d strive to learn,
Assured you’d not complain!
And if my finger I should burn,
You’d kiss away the pain.
I’d buy a little scrubbing-brush
And beautify the floors;
I’d warble gaily as a thrush
About my little chores.
But though I’d cook and sew and scrub,
A higher life I’d find;
I’d join a little women’s club
And cultivate my mind.
If you and I were one, my dear,
A model life we’d lead.
We’d travel on, from year to year,
At no increase of speed.
Ah, clear to me the vision of
The things that we should do!
And so I think it best, my love,
To string along as two."
Renunciation,"Chloe’s hair, no doubt, was brighter;
     Lydia’s mouth more sweetly sad;
Hebe’s arms were rather whiter;
     Languorous-lidded Helen had
Eyes more blue than e’er the sky was;
Lalage’s was subtler stuff;
Still, you used to think that I was
     Fair enough.
Now you’re casting yearning glances
     At the pale Penelope;
Cutting in on Claudia’s dances;
     Taking Iris out to tea.
Iole you find warm-hearted;
     Zoë’s cheek is far from rough—
Don’t you think it’s time we parted? . . .
     Fair enough!"
Résumé,"Razors pain you;
Rivers are damp;
Acids stain you;
And drugs cause cramp.
Guns aren’t lawful;
Nooses give;
Gas smells awful;
You might as well live."
Ballade of a Great Weariness,"There’s little to have but the things I had,
    There’s little to bear but the things I bore.
There’s nothing to carry and naught to add,
    And glory to Heaven, I paid the score.
There’s little to do but I did before,
    There’s little to learn but the things I know;
And this is the sum of a lasting lore:
    Scratch a lover, and find a foe.
And couldn’t it be I was young and mad
    If ever my heart on my sleeve I wore?
There’s many to claw at a heart unclad,
    And little the wonder it ripped and tore.
There’s one that’ll join in their push and roar,
    With stories to jabber, and stones to throw;
He’ll fetch you a lesson that costs you sore—
    Scratch a lover, and find a foe.
So little I’ll offer to you, my lad;
    It’s little in loving I set my store.
There’s many a maid would be flushed and glad,
    And better you’ll knock at a kindlier door.
I’ll dig at my lettuce, and sweep my floor—
    Forever, forever I’m done with woe—
And happen I’ll whistle about my chore,
    “Scratch a lover, and find a foe.”
                                    L’ENVOI:
Oh, beggar or prince, no more, no more!
    Be off and away with your strut and show.
The sweeter the apple, the blacker the core—
    Scratch a lover, and find a foe!"
They Part,"And if, my friend, you’d have it end,
    There’s naught to hear or tell.
But need you try to black my eye
    In wishing me farewell?
Though I admit an edgèd wit
    In woe is warranted,
May I be frank? . . . Such words as “——”
    Are better left unsaid.
There’s rosemary for you and me;
    But is it usual, dear,
To hire a man, and fill a van
    By way of souvenir?"
For a Sad Lady,"And let her loves, when she is dead,
     Write this above her bones:
“No more she lives to give us bread
     Who asked her only stones.”"
Rainy Night,"Ghosts of all my lovely sins,
     Who attend too well my pillow,
Gay the wanton rain begins;
     Hide the limp and tearful willow.
Turn aside your eyes and ears,
     Trail away your robes of sorrow,
You shall have my further years,—
     You shall walk with me tomorrow.
I am sister to the rain;
     Fey and sudden and unholy,
Petulant at the windowpane,
     Quickly lost, remembered slowly.
I have lived with shades, a shade;
     I am hung with graveyard flowers.
Let me be tonight arrayed
     In the silver of the showers.
Every fragile thing shall rust;
     When another April passes
I may be a furry dust,
     Sifting through the brittle grasses.
All sweet sins shall be forgot;
     Who will live to tell their siring?
Hear me now, nor let me rot
     Wistful still, and still aspiring.
Ghosts of dear temptations, heed;
     I am frail, be you forgiving.
See you not that I have need
     To be living with the living?
Sail, tonight, the Styx’s breast;
     Glide among the dim processions
Of the exquisite unblest,
     Spirits of my shared transgressions. 
Roam with young Persephone,
     Plucking poppies for your slumber …
With the morrow, there shall be
     One more wraith among your number."
The New Love,"If it shine or if it rain,
     Little will I care or know.
Days, like drops upon a pane,
     Slip, and join, and go.
At my door’s another lad;
     Here's his flower in my hair.
If he see me pale and sad,
     Will he see me fair?
I sit looking at the floor.
     Little will I think or say
If he seek another door;
     Even if he stay."
Hearthside,"Half across the world from me
Lie the lands I'll never see—
I, whose longing lives and dies
Where a ship has sailed away;
I, that never close my eyes
But to look upon Cathay.
Things I may not know nor tell
Wait, where older waters swell;
Ways that flowered at Sappho’s tread,
Winds that sighed in Homer’s strings,
Vibrant with the singing dead,
Golden with the dust of wings.
Under deeper skies than mine,
Quiet valleys dip and shine.
Where their tender grasses heal
Ancient scars of trench and tomb
I shall never walk: nor kneel
Where the bones of poets bloom.
If I seek a lovelier part,
Where I travel goes my heart;
Where I stray my thought must go;
With me wanders my desire.
Best to sit and watch the snow,
Turn the lock, and poke the fire."
Paths,"I shall tread, another year,
     Ways I walked with Grief,
Past the dry, ungarnered ear
     And the brittle leaf.
I shall stand, a year apart,
     Wondering, and shy,
Thinking, “Here she broke her heart;
     Here she pled to die.”
I shall hear the pheasants call,
     And the raucous geese;
Down these ways, another Fall,
     I shall walk with Peace.
But the pretty path I trod
     Hand-in-hand with Love,—
Underfoot, the nascent sod,
     Brave young boughs above,
And the stripes of ribbon grass
     By the curling way—
I shall never dare to pass
     To my dying day."
To a Much Too Unfortunate Lady,"He will love you presently
If you be the way you be.
Send your heart a-skittering.
He will stoop, and lift the thing.
Be your dreams as thread, to tease
Into patterns he shall please.
Let him see your passion is
Ever tenderer than his....
Go and bless your star above,
Thus are you, and thus is Love.
He will leave you white with woe,
If you go the way you go.
If your dreams were thread to weave,
He will pluck them from his sleeve.
If your heart had come to rest,
He will flick it from his breast.
Tender though the love he bore,
You had loved a little more....
Lady, go and curse your star,
Thus Love is, and thus you are."
Epitaph for a Darling Lady,"All her hours were yellow sands,
Blown in foolish whorls and tassels;
Slipping warmly through her hands;
Patted into little castles.
Shiny day on shiny day
Tumble in a rainbow clutter,
As she flipped them all away,
Sent them spinning down the gutter.
Leave for her a red young rose,
Go your way, and save your pity;
She is happy, for she knows
That her dust is very pretty."
Love Song,"My own dear love, he is strong and bold
     And he cares not what comes after.
His words ring sweet as a chime of gold,
     And his eyes are lit with laughter.
He is jubilant as a flag unfurled—
     Oh, a girl, she’d not forget him.
My own dear love, he is all my world,—
     And I wish I’d never met him.
My love, he’s mad, and my love, he’s fleet,
     And a wild young wood-thing bore him!
The ways are fair to his roaming feet,
     And the skies are sunlit for him.
As sharply sweet to my heart he seems
     As the fragrance of acacia.
My own dear love, he is all my dreams,—
     And I wish he were in Asia.
My love runs by like a day in June,
     And he makes no friends of sorrows.
He’ll tread his galloping rigadoon
     In the pathway of the morrows.
He’ll live his days where the sunbeams start,
     Nor could storm or wind uproot him.
My own dear love, he is all my heart,—
     And I wish somebody’d shoot him."
Braggart,"The days will rally, wreathing
Their crazy tarantelle;
And you must go on breathing,
But I'll be safe in hell.
Like January weather,
The years will bite and smart,
And pull your bones together
To wrap your chattering heart.
The pretty stuff you're made of
Will crack and crease and dry.
The thing you are afraid of
Will look from every eye.
You will go faltering after
The bright, imperious line,
And split your throat on laughter,
And burn your eyes with brine.
You will be frail and musty
With peering, furtive head,
Whilst I am young and lusty
Among the roaring dead."
Anecdote,"So silent I when Love was by
     He yawned, and turned away;
But Sorrow clings to my apron-strings
     I have so much to say."
Spring Song,"(In the Expected Manner)
Enter April, laughingly,
     Blossoms in her tumbled hair,
High of heart, and fancy-free—
     When was maiden half so fair?
Bright her eyes with easy tears,
     Wanton-sweet, her smiles for men.
“Winter’s gone,” she cries, “and here’s Spring again.”
When we loved, ‘twas April, too;
     Madcap April—urged us on.
Just as she did, so did you—
     Sighed, and smiled, and then were gone.
How she plied her pretty arts,
     How she laughed and sparkled then!
April, make love in our hearts
     Spring again!
 "
Somebody’s Song,"     This is what I vow;
He shall have my heart to keep,
Sweetly will we stir and sleep,
     All the years, as now.
Swift the measured sands may run;
Love like this is never done;
He and I are welded one:
     This is what I vow.
     This is what I pray:
Keep him by me tenderly;
Keep him sweet in pride of me,
     Ever and a day;
Keep me from the old distress;
Let me, for our happiness,
Be the one to love the less:
     This is what I pray.
     This is what I know:
Lovers’ oaths are thin as rain;
Love's a harbinger of pain—
     Would it were not so!
Ever is my heart a-thirst,
Ever is my love accurst;
He is neither last nor first—
     This is what I know."
The Thin Edge,"With you, my heart is quiet here,
And all my thoughts are cool as rain.
I sit and let the shifting year
Go by before the window-pane,
And reach my hand to yours, my dear . . .
I wonder what it’s like in Spain."
Men,"They hail you as their morning star
Because you are the way you are.
They'll try to make you different;
At once they have you, safe and sound,
They want to change you all around.
Your moods and ways they put a curse on;
They'd make of you another person.
They cannot let you go your gait;
They influence and educate.
They'd alter all that they admired.
They make me sick, they make me tired."
Ballade at Thirty-five,"This, no song of an ingénue,
     This, no ballad of innocence;
This, the rhyme of a lady who
     Followed ever her natural bents.
This, a solo of sapience,
     This, a chantey of sophistry,
This, the sum of experiments,—
     I loved them until they loved me.
Decked in garments of sable hue,
     Daubed with ashes of myriad Lents,
Wearing shower bouquets of rue,
     Walk I ever in penitence.
Oft I roam, as my heart repents,
     Through God’s acre of memory,
Marking stones, in my reverence,
     “I loved them until they loved me.”
Pictures pass me in long review,—
     Marching columns of dead events.
I was tender, and, often, true;
     Ever a prey to coincidence.
Always knew I the consequence;
     Always saw what the end would be.
We’re as Nature has made us—hence
     I loved them until they loved me.
                    L’Envoi:
Princes, never I’d give offense,
     Won’t you think of me tenderly?
Here’s my strength and my weakness, gents,—
     I loved them until they loved me."
One Perfect Rose,"A single flow’r he sent me, since we met.
     All tenderly his messenger he chose;
Deep-hearted, pure, with scented dew still wet—
     One perfect rose.
I knew the language of the floweret;
     “My fragile leaves,” it said, “his heart enclose.”
Love long has taken for his amulet
     One perfect rose.
Why is it no one ever sent me yet
     One perfect limousine, do you suppose?
Ah no, it’s always just my luck to get
     One perfect rose."
A Certain Lady,"Oh, I can smile for you, and tilt my head,
     And drink your rushing words with eager lips,
And paint my mouth for you a fragrant red,
     And trace your brows with tutored finger-tips.
When you rehearse your list of loves to me,
     Oh, I can laugh and marvel, rapturous-eyed.
And you laugh back, nor can you ever see,
     The thousand little deaths my heart has died.
And you believe, so well I know my part,
     That I am gay as morning, light as snow,
And all the straining things within my heart
     You'll never know.
Oh, I can laugh and listen, when we meet,
     And you bring tales of fresh adventurings,—
Of ladies delicately indiscreet,
     Of lingering hands, and gently whispered things.
And you are pleased with me, and strive anew
     To sing me sagas of your late delights.
Thus do you want me—marveling, gay, and true,
     Nor do you see my staring eyes of nights.
And when, in search of novelty, you stray,
     Oh, I can kiss you blithely as you go....
And what goes on, my love, while you're away,
     You'll never know."
Roundel,"She's passing fair, but so demure is she
     So quiet is her gown, so smooth her hair,
That few there are who note her and agree
     She's passing fair.
Yet when was ever beauty held more rare
Than simple heart and maiden modesty?
What fostered charms with virtue could compare?
Alas, no lover ever stops to see;
The best that she is offered is the air.
Yet—if the passing mark is minus
        D—
     She's passing fair."
Faut de Mieux,"Travel, trouble, music, art,
     A kiss, a frock, a rhyme—,
I never said they feed my heart,
     But still they pass my time."
Social Note,"Lady, lady, should you meet
One whose ways are all discreet,
One who murmurs that his wife
Is the lodestar of his life,
One who keeps assuring you
That he never was untrue,
Never loved another one . . .
Lady, lady, better run!"
Lullaby,"Sleep, pretty lady, the night is enfolding you,
     Drift, and so lightly, on crystalline streams.
Wrapped in its perfumes, the darkness is holding you;
     Starlight bespangles the way of your dreams.
Chorus the nightingales, wistfully amorous;
     Blessedly quiet, the bare of day.
All the sweet hours may your visions be glamorous,—
     Sleep, pretty lady, as long as you may.
Sleep, pretty lady, the night shall be still for you;
     Silvered and silent, it watches your rest.
Each little breeze, in its eagerness, will for you
     Murmur the melodies ancient and blest.
So in the midnight does happiness capture us;
     Morning is dim with another day's tears.
Give yourself sweetly to images rapturous,—
     Sleep, pretty lady, a couple of years.
Sleep, pretty lady, the world awaits day with you;
     Girlish and golden, the slender young moon.
Grant the fond darkness its mystical way with you,
     Morning returns to us ever too soon.
Roses unfold, in their loveliness, all for you;
     Blossom the lilies for hope of your glance.
When you're awake, all the men go and fall for you,
     Sleep, pretty lady, and give me a chance."
Song of Perfect Propriety,"Oh, I should like to ride the seas,
     A roaring buccaneer;
A cutlass banging at my knees,
     A dirk behind my ear.
And when my captives’ chains would clank
     I’d howl with glee and drink,
And then flight out the quivering plank
     And watch the beggars sink.
I’d like to straddle gory decks,
     And dig in laden sands,
And know the feel of throbbing necks
     Between my knotted hands.
Oh, I should like to strut and curse
     Among my blackguard crew. . . .
But I am writing little verse,
     As little ladies do.
Oh, I should like to dance and laugh
     And pose and preen and sway,
And rip the hearts of men in half,
     And toss the bits away.
I’d like to view the reeling years
     Through astonished eyes,
And dip my finger-tips in tears,
     And give my smiles for sighs.
I’d stroll beyond the ancient bounds,
     And tap at fastened gates,
And hear the prettiest of sounds,—
     The clink of shattered fates.
My slaves I’d like to bind with thongs
     That cut and burn and chill. . . .
But I am writing little songs,
     As little ladies will."
Song of One of the Girls,"Here in my heart I am Helen;
     I'm Aspasia and Hero, at least.
I'm Judith, and Jael, and Madame de Staël;
     I'm Salomé, moon of the East.
Here in my soul I am Sappho;
     Lady Hamilton am I, as well.
In me Récamier vies with Kitty O'Shea,
     With Dido, and Eve, and poor Nell.
I'm one of the glamorous ladies
     At whose beckoning history shook.
But you are a man, and see only my pan,
     So I stay home with a book."
Godspeed,"Oh, seek, my love, your newer way;
     I’ll not be left in sorrow.
So long as I have yesterday,
     Go take your damned to-morrow!"
News Item,"Men seldom make passes
At girls who wear glasses."
Chant for Dark Hours,"     Some men, some men 
     Cannot pass a 
     Book shop. 
(Lady, make your mind up, and wait your life away.)

     Some men, some men 
     Cannot pass a 
     Crap game. 
(He said he’d come a moonrise, and here’s another day!) 

     Some men, some men, 
     Cannot pass a 
     Bar-room. 
(Wait about, and hang about, and that’s the way it goes.)

     Some men, some men
     Cannot pass a 
     Woman. 
(Heaven never send me another one of those!)

     Some men, some men, 
     Cannot pass a 
     Golf course. 
(Read a book, and sew a seam, and slumber if you can.) 

      Some men, some men, 
      Cannot pass a 
      Haberdasher’s. 
(All your life you wait around for some damn man!) "
Portrait of the Artist,"Oh, lead me to a quiet cell 
   Where never footfall rankles, 
And bar the window passing well, 
    And gyve my wrists and ankles. 

Oh, wrap my eyes with linen fair, 
    With hempen cord go bind me, 
And, of your mercy, leave me there, 
    Nor tell them where to find me. 

Oh, lock the portal as you go, 
   And see its bolts be double....
Come back in half an hour or so, 
   And I will be in trouble. "
A Portrait,"Because my love is quick to come and go—
A little here, and then a little there—
What use are any words of mine to swear
My heart is stubborn, and my spirit slow
Of weathering the drip and drive of woe? 
What is my oath, when you have but to bare
My little, easy loves; and I can dare
Only to shrug, and answer, “They are so”?

You do not know how heavy a heart it is 
That hangs about my neck—a clumsy stone 
Cut with a birth, a death, a bridal-day. 
Each time I love, I find it still my own, 
Who take it, now to that lad, now to this, 
Seeking to give the wretched thing away. "
The Immortals,"If you should sail for Trebizond, or die, 
Or cry another name in your first sleep, 
Or see me board a train, and fail to sigh, 
Appropriately, I’d clutch my breast and weep. 
And you, if I should wander through the door, 
Or sin, or seek a nunnery, or save
My lips and give my cheek, would tread the floor
And aptly mention poison and the grave. 

Therefore the mooning world is gratified,
Quoting how prettily we sigh and swear; 
And you and I, correctly side by side, 
Shall live as lovers when our bones are bare; 
And though we lie forever enemies, 
Shall rank with Abélard and Héloïse. "
Condolence,"They hurried here, as soon as you had died, 
Their faces damp with haste and sympathy, 
And pressed my hand in theirs, and smoothed my knee, 
And clicked their tongues, and watched me, mournful-eyed. 
Gently they told me of that Other Side—
How, even then, you waited there for me, 
And what ecstatic meeting ours would be. 
Moved by the lovely tale, they broke, and cried. 

And when I smiled, they told me I was brave, 
And they rejoiced that I was comforted, 
And left, to tell of all the help they gave. 
But I had smiled to think how you, the dead, 
So curiously preoccupied and grave, 
Would laugh, could you have heard the things they said. "
“I Shall Come Back”,"I shall come back without fanfaronade
Of wailing wind and graveyard panoply; 
But, trembling, slip from cool Eternity—
A mild and most bewildered little shade. 
I shall not make sepulchral midnight raid, 
But softly come where I had longed to be 
In April twilight’s unsung melody, 
And I, not you, shall be the one afraid. 

Strange, that from lovely dreamings of the dead 
I shall come back to you, who hurt me most. 
You may not feel my hand upon your head, 
I’ll be so new and inexpert a ghost. 
Perhaps you will not know that I am near,—
And that will break my ghostly heart, my dear. "
Testament,"Oh, let it be a night of lyric rain
And singing breezes, when my bell is tolled. 
I have so loved the rain that I would hold 
Last in my ears its friendly, dim refrain. 
I shall lie cool and quiet, who have lain 
Fevered, and watched the book of day unfold. 
Death will not see my flinch; the heart is bold
That pain has made incapable of pain. 

Kinder the busy worms than ever love; 
It will be peace to lie there, empty-eyed, 
My bed made secret by the leveling showers, 
My breast replenishing the weeds above. 
And you will say of me, “Then has she died?
Perhaps I should have sent a spray of flowers.” "
I Know I Have Been Happiest,"I know I have been happiest at your side; 
But what is done, is done, and all’s to be. 
And small the good, to linger dolefully,—
Gaily it lived, and gallantly it died.
I will not make you songs of hearts denied, 
And you, being man, would have no tears of me, 
And should I offer you fidelity, 
You’d be, I think, a little terrified. 

Yet this the need of woman, this her curse:
To range her little gifts, and give, and give, 
Because the throb of giving’s sweet to bear. 
To you, who never begged me vows or verse, 
My gift shall be my absence, while I live; 
But after that, my dear, I cannot swear. "
The White Lady,"I cannot rest, I cannot rest 
   In strait and shiny wood, 
My woven hands upon my breast—
   The dead are all so good! 

The earth is cool across their eyes; 
    They lie there quietly. 
But I am neither old nor wise, 
    They do not welcome me. 

Where never I walked alone before
   I wander in the weeds; 
And people scream and bar the door, 
   And rattle at their beads. 

We cannot rest, we never rest
   Within a narrow bed
Who still must love the living best—
    Who hate the drowsy dead! "
August,"When my eyes are weeds, 
And my lips are petals, spinning 
Down the wind that has beginning 
Where the crumpled beeches start
In a fringe of salty reeds; 
When my arms are elder-bushes, 
And the rangy lilac pushes
Upward, upward through my heart; 

Summer, do your worst!
Light your tinsel moon, and call on 
Your performing stars to fall on
Headlong through your paper sky; 
Nevermore shall I be cursed
By a flushed and amorous slattern, 
With her dusty laces’ pattern
Trailing, as she straggles by. "
Folk Tune,"Other lads, their ways are daring:
      Other lads, they’re not afraid;
Other lads, they show they’re caring;
      Other lads—they know a maid.
Wiser Jock than ever you were,
      Will’s with gayer spirit blest,
Robin’s kindlier and truer,—
      Why should I love you the best?
Other lads, their eyes are bolder.
      Young they are, and strong and slim,
Ned is straight and broad of shoulder,
      Donald has a way with him.
David stands a head above you,
      Dick’s as brave as Lancelot,—
Why, ah why, then, should I love you?
      Naturally, I do not."
Verse for a Certain Dog,"Such glorious faith as fills your limpid eyes,
       Dear little friend of mine, I never knew.
All-innocent are you, and yet all-wise.
       (For heaven’s sake, stop worrying that shoe!)
You look about, and all you see is fair;
       This mighty globe was made for you alone.
Of all the thunderous ages, you’re the heir.
       (Get off the pillow with that dirty bone!)
A skeptic world you face with steady gaze;
       High in young pride you hold your noble head;
Gayly you meet the rush of roaring days.
       (Must you eat puppy biscuit on the bed?)
Lancelike your courage, gleaming swift and strong,
       Yours the white rapture of a wingèd soul,
Yours is a spirit like a May-day song.
       (God help you, if you break the goldfish bowl!)
“Whatever is, is good,” your gracious creed.
       You wear your joy of living like a crown.
Love lights your simplest act, your every deed.
       (Drop it, I tell you—put that kitten down!)
You are God’s kindliest gift of all,—a friend.
       Your shining loyalty unflecked by doubt,
You ask but leave to follow to the end.
       (Couldn’t you wait until I took you out?)"
Prophetic Soul,"Because your eyes are slant and slow,
Because your hair is sweet to tough,
My heart is high again; but oh,
I doubt if this will get me much."

The Cow Speaks to the Child,"There’s no me without you, 
says the cow in the sunlight 
being looked at, being drawn 
by the child with crayons. 
Is the hill an almond? the child 
wants to know. Is life irrefutable? 
The start of ‘me’ is the start of 
the ending of ‘you.’ See that hole
in your sock where
the cold can get through?
The child’s toe sticks 
through the hole now.
Some philosophers grow ulcers 
from eating loneliness. 
There’s not much we know.
The cow’s tongue smacks its lips. 
The child fills in its spots 
with blue crayon and silence. 
A dragonfly or not."
Glossolalia,"My baby brandishes a wooden knife
meant to halve a wooden shallot
as he hollers his newest word. Knife.
Look at my son, flashing
his dagger, jamming it into plush
animals. Knife, knife. Look at him,
oblivious to the weapons
littering his lineage or, God forbid,
possessed by them. Can the babies
planted in the dirt of our bodies
absorb the torments buried there?
My gentle, watchful child
wants all the knives. But some days,
everywhere, blue. The bear, blue.
The bells, blue, the car, the cup,
the light. I marvel at my son,
who marvels at the sky—blue, blue—
no matter how gray the bully of clouds.
And this is all I want.
Look at my son laughing at the rain.
Look how he prods the window
with his knife, insisting
we cut up the storm, demanding 
the blue back into view."
Red-Lipped Poem,"You only respond
to marrow
scooped clean.
You stare. I touch
your silk. Shiver. Some nights,
you let in a kiss abruptly
through the mask. Pant.
            Here, your bread,
sliced into neat warm ovals.
Whisper. It’s impossible. Is it
that you have nowhere
to go? No. Your family
loves you. But here you are
the only monster. The last
and first star: the one
in the clan who won’t stay put.
Tonight, you arrive;
you said you wouldn’t.
Here, a linen napkin;
we can't always afford it.
I do not always have
what you lope about
seeking. It isn’t so easy
to keep the harness buckled.
            Be still. Only we know
how this works."
Patients,"Why do they call us ""the patient""
We are not patient.  We endure.
The anxious tedium of public hospital 
waiting rooms, because waiting
is the punishment of the poor;
interminable buses to inconvenient places
where we count up our cash, calculating
whether we can take a cab home 
instead of riding our exhaustion;
the angry contempt of specialists, taught to believe
any pain they cannot explain is insubordinate,
deliberate, offensive.
We are not patient. We are denied.
Not medically necessary, they say, not proven.
Feel free to appeal.  We are experts at appealing,
so we begin again, gathering documents, faxing releases,
collecting letters and signatures, 
giving our numbers, all our numbers, 
to dozens of indifferent, underpaid clerks,
stacking up evidence for the hearing, where we will declare
as civilly as we can to the affronted panels
that it is necessary that we breathe,
sleep, digest, be eased of pain, have medicines
and therapies and machines, 
and that we not be required to beg.
While I am waiting, I am using my pen,
steadily altering words.
Where the card says ""medically indigent"" 
I cross it out and write indignant.
Where my records say ""chemically sensitive""
I write chemically assaulted, chemically wounded,
chemically outraged. On the form listing risk factors
for cancer, I write in my candidates: agribusiness, 
air fresheners, dry cleaning, river water, farm life,
bathing, drinking, eating, vinyl, cosmetics, plastic, greed. 
I am making an intricate graffiti poem
out of mountains of unnecessary paperwork.
Where the doctor has written ""disheveled"" I write untamed.
Where it says ""refused treatment,"" I write refused to be lied to.
Where it says safe, side effects minimal
I say prove it. What do you mean minimal?
What do you mean side? I write
unmarketed effects unmentionable.
Where it asks, authorization?  I write inherent,
authorized from birth.  
Are you the patient? she asks, ready to transfer my call.
I say only with my own sweet, brave body.
I say, Not today, no.  I have no patience left.
I am the person who is healing, I say, 
in spite of everything. I will have to put you on hold she says. Yes,
hold me I say. That would be good. "
One Way or Another,"it is you who leaves. So I set out 
to read for signs of imminence, 
the same river twice stepped in.
Morning rises gently on the harbor;
our letters come disguised as life. 
We know the score but fracture 
on fact. We sign a dotted line 
made out of promise—the pipes 
in November clanging on with heat,
the window left at night a little open. 
I love you; then what? Hands 
suddenly alive. I plead with time, 
adamant, remorseless. So we begin 
in earnest; what then? I plead 
with time, adamant, remorseless.
Hands suddenly alive. I love you; 
then what? The pipes in November 
clanging on with heat, the window 
left at night a little open. We sign 
a dotted line made out of promise—
we know the score but fracture 
on fact. Our letters come disguised 
as life; morning rises gently on 
the harbor. So I set out to read 
for signs of imminence, the same 
river twice stepped in. One way 
or another, it is you who leaves."
A Cloud of Drench Bearing Down,"An odor in the breeze—spruce; palosanto; silver dust 
of a hard freeze. This isn’t love-love, I say back. But 
what do I know—except 
                                              I’ve gotten close enough to too far 
enough times to know 
                                         it is possible to pull back, and for that thrill 
to be enough. But what damage that moment does, the having of it 
—the halving of it—again and again in the mind, 
I cannot say. How leaves, 
                                              no matter how long they soak in the river, 
will never turn truly black—though how could I be sure of this, either, 
without staying the weeks to watch. 
As the day drains 
                                  out the window, I become more and more 
the focus of my own gaze. Light leaches from every 
silvered feather; every bone-bright twig 
now grey as silt—the great equity 
                                                                of darkness coming down. 
How you can find that what you believed was singular, and needed 
to be, is not—

The Acceptance,"Dad’s house stands again, four years
after being demolished. I walk in.
He lies in bed, licks his rolling paper,
and when I ask Where have you been?
We buried you, he says I know,
I know. I lean into his smoke, tell him
I went back to Jamaica. I met your brothers,
losing  you made me need them. He says
something I don’t hear. What?  Moving lips,
no sound. I shake my head. He frowns.
Disappears. I wake in the hotel room,
heart drumming. I get up slowly, the floor
is wet. I wade into the bathroom,
my father stands by the sink, all the taps
running. He laughs and takes
my hand, squeezes.
His ring digs into my flesh. I open my eyes.
I’m by a river, a shimmering sheet
of green marble. Red ants crawl up
an oak tree’s flaking bark. My hands
are cold mud. I follow the tall grass
by the riverbank, the song. My Orisha,
Oshun in gold bracelets and earrings, scrubs
her yellow dress in the river. I wave, Hey!
She keeps singing. The dress turns the river
gold and there’s my father surfacing.
He holds a white and green drum. I watch him
climb out of the water, drip toward Oshun.
They embrace. My father beats his drum.
With shining hands, she signs: Welcome.
My father beats his drum."
Finis,"Now it's over, and now it's done;
     Why does everything look the same?
Just as bright, the unheeding sun,—
     Can't it see that the parting came?
People hurry and work and swear
     Laugh and grumble and die and wed,
Ponder what they will eat and wear,—
     Don't they know that our love is dead?
Just as busy, the crowded street;
     Cars and wagons go rolling on
Children chuckle, and lovers meet,—
     Don't they know that our love is gone?
No one pauses to pay a tear;
     None walks slow, for the love that's through,—

Sick4Sick,"I think my lover’s cane is sexy. The way they walk
like a rainstorm stumbles slow across the landscape.
How, with fingers laced together, our boots & canes 
click in time—unsteady rhythm of a metronome’s limp 
wrist. All sway & swish, first person I ever saw walk with
a lisp. Call this our love language of unspokens: 
We share so many symptoms, the first time we thought
to hyphenate our names was, playfully, to christen
ourselves a new disorder. We trade tips on medication,
on how to weather what prescriptions make you sick 
to [maybe] make you well. We make toasts with
acetaminophen bought in bulk. Kiss in the airport 
terminal through surgical masks. Rub the knots from 
each others’ backs. We dangle FALL RISK bracelets
from our walls & call it decoration. We visit another
ER & call it a date. When we are sick, again, for months
—with a common illness that will not leave—it is not 
the doctors who care for us. We make do ourselves.
At night, long after the sky has darkened-in—something
like a three-day-bruise, littered with satellites I keep
mistaking for stars—our bodies are fever-sweat stitched. 
A chimera. Shadow-puppet of our lust. Bones bowed into 
a new beast [with two backs, six legs of metal & flesh & 
carbon fiber]. Beside my love, I find I can’t remember 
any prayers so I whisper the names of our medications 
like the names of saints. Orange bottles scattered around 
the mattress like unlit candles in the dark."

Wail,"LOVE has gone a-rocketing.
        That is not the worst;

Joy has gone the way it came.

Dig for me the narrow bed,

All my pretty hates are dead,
   And what have I left?"
Light of Love,"JOY stayed with me a night—
     Young and free and fair—
And in the morning light
He left me there.
Then Sorrow came to stay,
And lay upon my breast;
He walked with me in the day,
And knew me best.
I’ll never be a bride,
Nor yet celibate,
So I’m living now with Pride—
A cold bedmate.
He must not hear nor see,
Nor could he forgive
That Sorrow still visits me
Each day I live.  "
Epitaph,"THE first time I died, I walked my ways;
     I followed the file of limping days.
I held me tall, with my head flung up,
But I dared not look on the new moon’s cup.
I dared not look on the sweet young rain,
And between my ribs was a gleaming pain.
The next time I died, they laid me deep.
They spoke worn words to hallow my sleep.
They tossed me petals, they wreathed me fern,
They weighted me down with a marble urn.
And I lie here warm, and I lie here dry,
And watch the worms slip by, slip by."

The while I know that every foe
     Is faithful till I die."
For an Unknown Lady,"Lady, if you'd slumber sound,
Keep your eyes upon the ground.
If you'd toss and turn at night,
Slip your glances left and right.
Would the mornings find you gay,
Never give your heart away.
Would they find you pale and sad,
Fling it to a whistling lad.
Ah, but when his pleadings burn,
Will you let my words return?
Will you lock your pretty lips,
And deny your finger-tips,
Veil away your tender eyes,
Just because some words were wise?
If he whistles low and clear
When the insistent moon is near
And the secret stars are known,—
Will your heart be still your own
Just because some words were true?...
Lady, I was told them, too!"

     To do my best to please,
And change, with every passing lad

And if you do not like me so,
     To hell, my love, with you!"
The Dark Girl’s Rhyme,"WHO was there had seen us
         Wouldn’t bid him run?
Heavy lay between us
    All our sires had done.
There he was, a-springing,
    Of a pious race—
Setting hags a-swinging,
     In a market-place;
Sowing turnips over
     Where the poppies lay;
Looking past the clover,
      Adding up the hay;
Shouting through the Spring song,
      Clumping down the sod;
Toadying, in sing-song
      To a crabbèd god.
There I was, that came of
      Folk of mud and flame—
I that had my name of
      Them without a name.
Up and down a mountain
      Streeled my silly stock;
Passing by a fountain,
      Wringing at a rock;
Devil-gotten sinners,
      Throwing back their heads;
Fiddling for their dinners,
      Kissing for their beds.
Not a one had seen us
      Wouldn’t help him flee.
Angry ran between us
      Blood of him and me.
How shall I be mating
      Who have looked above—
Living for a hating,
      Dying of a love?
  
   "
Convalescent,"HOW shall I wail, that wasn’t meant for weeping?
     Love has run and left me, oh, what then?
Dream, then, I must, who never can be sleeping;
What if I should meet Love, once again?
What if I met him, walking on the highway?
Let him see how lightly I should care.
He’d travel his way, I would follow my way;
Hum a little song, and pass him there.
What if at night, beneath a sky of ashes,
He should seek my doorstep, pale with need?
There he could lie, and dry would be my lashes;
Let him stop his noise, and let me read.
Oh, but I’m gay, that’s better off without him;
Would he’d come and see me, laughing here.
Lord!  Don’t I know I’d have my arms about him,
Crying to him, “Oh, come in, my dear!”"
A Well-Worn Story,"IN April, in April,
   My one love came along,
And I ran the slope of my high hill
To follow a thread of song.
His eyes were hard as porphyry
With looking on cruel lands;
His voice went slipping over me
Like terrible silver hands.
Together we trod the secret lane
And walked the muttering town.
I wore my heart like a wet, red stain
On the breast of a velvet gown.
In April, in April,
My love went whistling by,
And I stumbled here to my high hill
Along the way of a lie.
Now what should I do in this place
But sit and count the chimes,
And splash cold water on my face
And spoil a page with rhymes. "
A Very Short Song,"ONCE, when I was young and true,
        Someone left me sad—
Broke my brittle heart in two;
     And that is very bad.
Love is for unlucky folk,
     Love is but a curse.
Once there was a heart I broke;
     And that, I think, is worse.
 "
The Trifler,"DEATH’S the lover that I’d be taking;
      Wild and fickle and fierce is he.
Small’s his care if my heart be breaking—
   Gay young Death would have none of me.
Hear them clack of my haste to greet him!
   No one other my mouth had kissed.
I had dressed me in silk to meet him—
   False young Death would not hold the tryst.
Slow’s the blood that was quick and stormy,
   Smooth and cold is the bridal bed;
I must wait till he whistles for me—
   Proud young Death would not turn his head.
I must wait till my breast is wilted,
   I must wait till my back is bowed,
I must rock in the corner, jilted,—
   Death went galloping down the road.
Gone’s my heart with a trifling rover.
    Fine he was in the game he played—
Kissed, and promised, and threw me over,
    And rode away with a prettier maid.
 
 "
The False Friends,"THEY laid their hands upon my head,
They stroked my cheek and brow;
And time could heal a hurt, they said,
And time could dim a vow.
And they were pitiful and mild
Who whispered to me then,
“The heart that breaks in April, child,
Will mend in May again.”
Oh, many a mended heart they knew,
So old they were, and wise.
And little did they have to do
To come to me with lies!
Who flings me silly talk of May
Shall meet a bitter soul;
For June was nearly spent away
Before my heart was whole.
 "
The Small Hours,"NO more my little song comes back;
       And now of nights I lay
My head on down, to watch the black
     And wait the unfailing gray.
Oh, sad are winter nights, and slow;
     And sad’s a song that’s dumb
And sad it is to lie and know
     Another dawn will come."
Keep A-Pluggin' Away,"I've a humble little motto
That is homely, though it's true,—
    Keep a-pluggin' away.
It's a thing when I've an object
That I always try to do,—
    Keep a-pluggin' away.
When you've rising storms to quell,
When opposing waters swell,
It will never fail to tell,—
    Keep a-pluggin' away.
If the hills are high before
And the paths are hard to climb,
    Keep a-pluggin' away.
And remember that successes
Come to him who bides his time,—
    Keep a-pluggin' away.
From the greatest to the least,
None are from the rule released.
Be thou toiler, poet, priest,
    Keep a-pluggin' away.
Delve away beneath the surface,
There is treasure farther down,—
    Keep a-pluggin' away.
Let the rain come down in torrents,
Let the threat'ning heavens frown,
    Keep a-pluggin' away.
When the clouds have rolled away,
There will come a brighter day
All your labor to repay,—
    Keep a-pluggin' away.
There 'll be lots of sneers to swallow.
There'll be lots of pain to bear,—
    Keep a-pluggin' away.
If you've got your eye on heaven,
Some bright day you'll wake up there,
    Keep a-pluggin' away.
Perseverance still is king;
Time its sure reward will bring;
Work and wait unwearying,—
    Keep a-pluggin' away."
Threnody,"LILACS blossom just as sweet
Now my heart is shattered.
If I bowled it down the street,
Who’s to say it mattered?
If there’s one that rode away
What would I be missing?
Lips that taste of tears, they say,
Are the best for kissing.
Eyes that watch the morning star
Seem a little brighter;
Arms held out to darkness are
Usually whiter.
Shall I bar the strolling guest,
Bind my brow with willow,
When, they say, the empty breast
Is softer than the pillow?
That a heart falls tinkling down,
Never think it ceases.
Every likely lad in town
Gathers up the pieces.
If there’s one gone whistling by
Would I let it grieve me?
Let him wonder if I lie;
Let him half believe me.
 "
The Spellin' Bee,"I never shall furgit that night when father hitched up Dobbin,
An' all us youngsters clambered in an' down the road went bobbin'
To school where we was kep' at work in every kind o' weather,
But where that night a spellin'-bee was callin' us together.
'Twas one o' Heaven's banner nights, the stars was all a glitter,
The moon was shinin' like the hand o' God had jest then lit her.
The ground was white with spotless snow, the blast was sort o' stingin';
But underneath our round-abouts, you bet our hearts was singin'.
That spellin'-bee had be'n the talk o' many a precious moment,
The youngsters all was wild to see jes' what the precious show meant,
An' we whose years was in their teens was little less desirous
O' gittin' to the meetin' so's our sweethearts could admire us.
So on we went so anxious fur to satisfy our mission
That father had to box our ears, to smother our ambition.
But boxin' ears was too short work to hinder cur arrivin',
He jest turned roun' an' smacked us all, an' kep' right on a-drivin'.
Well, soon the schoolhouse hove in sight, the winders beamin' brightly;
The sound o' talkin' reached our ears, and voices laffin' lightly.
It puffed us up so full an' big 'at I'll jest bet a dollar,
There wa'n't a feller there but felt the strain upon his collar.
So down we jumped an' in we went ez sprightly ez you make 'em,
But somethin' grabbed us by the knees an' straight began to shake 'em.
Fur once within that lighted room, our feelin's took a canter,
An' scurried to the zero mark ez quick ez Tam O'Shanter.
Cause there was crowds o' people there, both sexes an' all stations;
It looked like all the town had come an' brought all their relations.
The first I saw was Nettie Gray, I thought that girl was dearer
'N' gold; an' when I got a chance, you bet I aidged up near her.
An' Farmer Dobbs's girl was there, the one 'at Jim was sweet on,
An' Cyrus Jones an' Mandy Smith an' Faith an' Patience Deaton.
Then Parson Brown an' Lawyer Jones were present—all attention,
An' piles on piles of other folks too numerous to mention.
The master rose an' briefly said: 'Good friends, dear brother Crawford,
To spur the pupils' minds along, a little prize has offered.
To him who spells the best to-night—or 't may be 'her'—no tellin'—
He offers ez a jest reward, this precious work on spellin'.'
A little blue-backed spellin'-book with fancy scarlet trimmin';
We boys devoured it with our eyes—so did the girls an' women.
He held it up where all could see, then on the table set it,
An' ev'ry speller in the house felt mortal bound to get it.
At his command we fell in line, prepared to do our dooty,
Outspell the rest an' set 'em down, an' carry home the booty.
'Twas then the merry times began, the blunders, an' the laffin',
The nudges an' the nods an' winks an' stale good-natured chaffin'.
Ole Uncle Hiram Dane was there, the clostest man a-livin',
Whose only bugbear seemed to be the dreadful fear o' givin'.
His beard was long, his hair uncut, his clothes all bare an' dingy;
It wasn't cause the man was pore, but jest so mortal stingy.
An' there he sot by Sally Riggs a-smilin' an' a-smirkin',
An' all his childern lef' to home a diggin' an' a-workin'.
A widower he was, an' Sal was thinkin' 'at she'd wing him;
I reckon he was wond'rin' what them rings o' hern would bring him.
An' when the spellin'-test commenced, he up an' took his station,
A-spellin' with the best o' them to beat the very nation.
An' when he'd spell some youngster down, he'd turn to look at Sally,
An' say: 'The teachin' nowadays can't be o' no great vally.'
But true enough the adage says, 'Pride walks in slipp'ry places,'
Fur soon a thing occurred that put a smile on all our faces.
The laffter jest kep' ripplin' 'roun' an' teacher couldn't quell it,
Fur when he give out 'charity' ole Hiram couldn't spell it.
But laffin' 's ketchin' an' it throwed some others off their bases,
An' folks 'u'd miss the very word that seemed to fit their cases.
Why, fickle little Jessie Lee come near the house upsettin'
By puttin' in a double 'kay' to spell the word 'coquettin'.'
An' when it come to Cyrus Jones, it tickled me all over—
Him settin' up to Mandy Smith an' got sot down on 'lover.'
But Lawyer Jones of all gone men did shorely look the gonest,
When he found out that he'd furgot to put the 'h' in 'honest.'
An' Parson Brown, whose sermons were too long fur toleration,
Caused lots o' smiles by missin' when they give out 'condensation.'
So one by one they giv' it up — the big words kep' a-landin',
Till me an' Nettie Gray was left, the only ones a-standin',
An' then my inward strife began—I guess my mind was petty!—
I did so want that spellin'-book; but then to spell down Nettie
Jest sort o' went ag'in my grain—I somehow couldn't do it,
An' when I git a notion fixed, I'm great on stickin' to it.
So when they giv' the next word out—I hadn't otter tell it,
But then 't was all fur Nettie's sake—I missed so's she could spell it.
She spelt the word, then looked at me so lovin'-like an' mello',
I tell you 't sent a hunderd pins a-shootin' through a fello'.
O' course I had to stand the jokes an' chaffin' of the fello's,
But when they handed her the book I vow I wasn't jealous.
We sung a hymn, an' Parson Brown dismissed us like he otter,
Fur, la! he'd learned a thing er two an' made his blessin' shorter.
'Twas late an' cold when we got out, but Nettie liked cold weather,
An' so did I, so we agreed we 'd jest walk home together.
We both wuz silent, fur of words we nuther had a surplus,
'Till she spoke out quite sudden like, 'You missed that word on purpose.'
Well, I declare it frightened me; at first I tried denyin',
But Nettie, she jest smiled an' smiled, she knowed that I was lyin'.
Sez she: 'That book is yourn by right;' sez I: 'It never could be—
I—I—you—ah—' an' there I stuck, an' well she understood me.
So we agreed that later on when age had giv' us tether,
We'd jine our lots an' settle down to own that book together."
Reinforcements,"The vestibule to experience is not to
    Be exalted into epic grandeur. These men are going
To their work with this idea, advancing like a school of fish through
Still water—waiting to change the course or dismiss
    The idea of movement, till forced to. The words of the Greeks
Ring in our ears, but they are vain in comparison with a sight like this.
The pulse of intention does not move so that one
    Can see it, and moral machinery is not labelled, but
The future of time is determined by the power of volition."
Welcome to the Gut House,"Outside a door in east Maui, a brindled dog sits.
            No cars drive the dirt road.
No child appears with food to share or ask for.
            There is only inside, today.
A telephone cries, and to each caller, a grandmother
            chirps, “Aloha. God bless you.”
In a corner bedroom, a girl is kept in bed,
            surrounded by mosquito nets & women,
who take turns binding her wound.
            Miles of violence in their eyes, they know
how to speed through marrow. They know
            scars & stars, two things
a woman should never count in relation to her body.
            The number of names, maybe,
wired around her stomach. The number of stomachs
            opened like doors and, not so much
cleaned as cleaned of secrets. Yes, there is something
            better than the heart. A whirring
sent deep in the body. Like a girl in a house.
            You are finally home. 
No glorified organ, no heroic heart. Only guts.
            Viscera. Ask any Hawaiian.
Drive the dirt road, follow my grandmother’s voice.
            She will bless you. My aunties & cousins, 
their long fingers pinned to the walls, they point 
            the way to a corner bedroom,
this poem. My sister is closing the mosquito net. 
            I am pooling in a bed of gauze. 
New versions of the Bible will use the word “heart.”
            Ask any of us where it really hurts. 
Even my grandma, god bless you.
            Ask the brindled dog guarding my stomach."
At the New York City AIDS Memorial,"Your absence is a bisected city 
block where a hospital once stood.
The footprint of a yellow house on Providence’s east side
we once shared. Demolished. A white pickup you drove
decorated with black dice. The ground beneath it
crumbled—poof—then paved over, engraved like verses
into stone. When I was told what happened to you,
I sank to the wet floor of a bar’s bathroom, furious
that you left us to reassemble ourselves
from rubble. To build, between subway stops,
some saccharine monument
pigeons shit on, empty except for a circle of queens 
chattering, furnishing the air like ghosts. Your death
means I’m always equidistant from you, 
no matter where I travel, where I linger, 
misguided, hopeful. Last night, by candle light,
a woman unearthed me. 
Together, she and I grieved 
the impossibility of disappearing 
into one another. Poof. Since you died,
erasure obsesses me. Among the photos at the memorial,
one of a banner that reads WHERE IS YOUR RAGE? 
ACT UP FIGHT BACK FIGHT AIDS, carried by five
young men. Your face in each. Your beautiful face."
Night Needs No Stars,"for Janice Mirikitani
I watched you survivesurvive
your thick hair and wide laugh
a list of words we were not allowed
to write into poems
the blanket is the night
you were too bright to be a star
to give blankets is an ancient trick
for you, a balm
and June who if she was her month
straddling spring and summer
with her arches, tunnels, bridges
then you, might have been her
balance, an autumn predicting
softness, snow that never reaches fog
snow that illuminates no mattermatter the time
you and she making us make words
and we brokebroke by making words
matter and you blanket and stars both and all."
Cloud Demolition,"Anvil clouds in the west.
My father dies in hospice
while I’m on the highway,
stuck in roadwork. 
Gaunt on the gurney.
Limbs impossibly still.
Mouth slightly open, 
as if surprised, as if saying 
ah! One eye half closed, 
the other looking up,
lit by a further light,
a sky in the ceiling. 
I touch his hand, barely 
cool. It’s only been 
an hour. At the elevator, 
I’m not ready to drop 
down the bright chute.
I go back. Bend & kiss
his hand. Outside, long
soft nails hammer the earth."
Climate,"It felt familiar, your mouth moving 
            up my side like a gale warning. My 
                        arm calico—mammatus clouds—
            blood brought to the surface. 
Now I understand my childhood
            home. Releasing shingle after shingle
                        into the brutal air. Our front door 
            torn and flat in the yard. Violent 
gusts whipping through the marshes—
            the back of your hand. 
                        Of what I have unlearned
            this was the hardest. 
One sandpiper singing 
still, desire does not 
                        have to leave you
            ruined."
I Sought the Wood in Winter,"I sought the wood in summer
             When every twig was green;
The rudest boughs were tender,
            And buds were pink between.
Light-fingered aspens trembled
            In fitful sun and shade,
And daffodils were golden
            In every starry glade.
The brook sang like a robin—
            My hand could check him where
The lissome maiden willows
            Shook out their yellow hair.
“How frail a thing is Beauty,”
            I said, “when every breath
She gives the vagrant summer
            But swifter woos her death.
For this the star dust troubles,
            For this have ages rolled:
To deck the wood for bridal
            And slay her with the cold.”
I sought the wood in winter
            When every leaf was dead;
Behind the wind-whipped branches
            The winter sun set red.
The coldest star was rising
            To greet that bitter air,
The oaks were writhen giants;
            Nor bud nor bloom was there.
The birches, white and slender,
            In deathless marble stood,
The brook, a white immortal,
            Slept silent in the wood.
“How sure a thing is Beauty,”
            I cried. “No bolt can slay,
No wave nor shock despoil her,
            No ravishers dismay.
Her warriors are the angels
            That cherish from afar,
Her warders people Heaven
            And watch from every star.
The granite hills are slighter,
            The sea more like to fail;
Behind the rose the planet,
            The Law behind the veil.”"
De Profundis,"Oh, is it, then, Utopian
To hope that I may meet a man
Who’ll not relate, in accents suave,
The tales of girls he used to have?"
Pattern,"Leave me to my lonely pillow.
    Go, and take your silly posies;
Who has vowed to wear the willow
    Looks a fool, tricked out in roses.
Who are you, my lad, to ease me?
    Leave your pretty words unspoken.
Tinkling echoes little please me,
    Now my heart is freshly broken.
Over young are you to guide me,
    And your blood is slow and sleeping.
If you must, then sit beside me....
    Tell me, why have I been weeping?"
Plea,"Secrets, you said, would hold us two apart;
    You’d have me know of you your least transgression
And so the intimate places of your heart,
    Kneeling, you bared to me, as in confession.
Softly you told of loves that went before,—
    Of clinging arms, of kisses gladly given;
Luxuriously clean of heart once more,
    You rose up, then, and stood before me, shriven.
When this, my day of happiness, is through,
    And love, that bloomed so fair, turns brown and brittle,
There is a thing that I shall ask of you—
    I, who have given so much, and asked so little.
Some day, when there’s another in my stead;
    Again you’ll feel the need of absolution,
And you will go to her, and bow your head,
    And offer her your past, as contribution.
When with your list of loves you overcome her,
For Heaven’s sake, keep this one secret from her!"
Comment,"Oh, life is a glorious cycle of song,
A medley of extemporanea;
And love is a thing that can never go wrong;
And I am Marie of Roumania."
Now at Liberty,"Little white love, your way you’ve taken;
    Now I am left alone, alone.
Little white love, my heart’s forsaken.
    (Whom shall I get by telephone?)
Well do I know there’s no returning;
    Once you go out, it’s done, it’s done.
All of my days are gray with yearning.
    (Nevertheless, a girl needs fun.)
Little white love, perplexed and weary,
    Sadly your banner fluttered down.
Sullen the days, and dreary, dreary.
    (Which of the boys is still in town?)
Radiant and sure, you came a-flying;
    Puzzled, you left on lagging feet.
Slow in my breast, my heart is dying.
    (Nevertheless, a girl must eat.)
Little white love, I hailed you gladly;
    Now I must wave you out of sight.
Ah, but you used me badly, badly.
    (Who’d like to take me out tonight?)
All of the blundering words I’ve spoken,
    Little white love, forgive, forgive.
Once you went out, my heart fell, broken.
    (Nevertheless, a girl must live.)"
Inventory,"Four be the things I am wiser to know:
Idleness, sorrow, a friend, and a foe.
Four be the things I’d been better without:
Love, curiosity, freckles, and doubt.
Three be the things I shall never attain:
Envy, content, and sufficient champagne.
Three be the things I shall have till I die:
Laughter and hope and a sock in the eye."
Curtain,"Villain shows his indiscretion,
Villain's partner makes confession.
Juvenile, with golden tresses,
Finds her pa and dons long dresses.
Scapegrace comes home money-laden,
Hero comforts tearful maiden,
Soubrette marries loyal chappie,
Villain skips, and all are happy."
After a Visit,"I Be'n down in ole Kentucky
    Fur a week er two, an' say,
'T wuz ez hard ez breakin' oxen
    Fur to tear myse'f away.
Allus argerin' 'bout fren'ship
    An' yer hospitality—
Y' ain't no right to talk about it
    Tell you be'n down there to see.
See jest how they give you welcome
    To the best that's in the land,
Feel the sort o' grip they give you
    When they take you by the hand.
Hear 'em say, ""We're glad to have you,
    Better stay a week er two;""
An' the way they treat you makes you
    Feel that ev'ry word is true.
Feed you tell you hear the buttons
    Crackin' on yore Sunday vest;
Haul you roun' to see the wonders
    Tell you have to cry for rest.
Drink yer health an' pet an' praise you
    Tell you git to feel ez great

Well, pleg-gone it, I 'm jes' tickled,

I be'n down in ole Kentucky,
    An' I want o' go ag'in."
After the Quarrel,"So we, who've supped the self-same cup,
    To-night must lay our friendship by;
Your wrath has burned your judgment up,
    Hot breath has blown the ashes high.
You say that you are wronged— ah, well,
    I count that friendship poor, at best
A bauble, a mere bagatelle,
    That cannot stand so slight a test.
I fain would still have been your friend,
    And talked and laughed and loved with you;
But since it must, why, let it end;
    The false but dies, 't is not the true.
So we are favored, you and I,
    Who only want the living truth.
It was not good to nurse the lie;
    'Tis well it died in harmless youth.
I go from you to-night to sleep.
    Why, what's the odds? why should I grieve?
I have no fund of tears to weep
    For happenings that undeceive.
The days shall come, the days shall go
    Just as they came and went before.
The sun shall shine, the streams shall flow
    Though you and I are friends no more.
And in the volume of my years,
    Where all my thoughts and acts shall be,
The page whereon your name appears
    Shall be forever sealed to me.
Not that I hate you over-much,
    'Tis less of hate than love defied;
Howe'er, our hands no more shall touch,
    We'll go our ways, the world is wide."
The Dramatists,"A string of shiny days we had, 
     A spotless sky, a yellow sun; 
And neither you nor I was sad
     When that was through and done. 

But when, one day, a boy comes by 
   And pleads me with your happiest vow, 
“There was a lad I knew—” I'll sigh; 
   “I do not know him now.”

And when another girl shall pass
   And speak a little name I said, 
Then you will say “There was a lass—
   I wonder is she dead.”

And each of us will sigh, and start 
   A-talking of a faded year, 
And lay a hand above a heart, 
   And dry a pretty tear. "
Story of Mrs. W,"My garden blossoms pink and white, 
      A place of decorous murmuring
Where I am safe from August night
     And cannot feel the knife of spring. 

And I may walk the pretty place
    Before the curtsying hollyhocks
And laundered daisies, round of face—
    Good little girls, in party frocks. 

My trees are amiably arrayed
    In pattern on the dappled sky, 
And I may sit in filtered shade
    And watch the tidy years go by. 

And I may amble pleasantly 
   And hear my neighbors list their bones
And click my tongue in sympathy, 
   And count the cracks in paving stones. 

My door is grave in oaken strength, 
    The cool of linen calms my bed, 
And there at night I stretch my length
     And envy no one but the dead. "
Verse Reporting Late Arrival at a Conclusion,"Consider a lady gone reckless in love,
     In novels and plays:
You watch her proceed in a drapery of
     A roseate haze.
Acclaimed as a riot, a wow, and a scream,
She flies with her beau to les Alpes Maritimes,
And moves in a mist of a mutual dream
     The rest of her days.
In life, if you’ll listen to one who has been
     Observant of such,
A lady in love is more frequently in
     Decidedly Dutch.
The thorn, so to say, is revealed by the rose.
The best that she gets is a sock in the nose.
These authors and playwrights, I’m forced to suppose,
     Don’t get around much."
Unfortunate Coincidence,"By the time you swear you’re his,
     Shivering and sighing,
And he vows his passion is
     Infinite, undying—
Lady, make a note of this:
     One of you is lying."
Voices of the Air,"But then there comes that moment rare
When, for no cause that I can find,
The little voices of the air
Sound above all the sea and wind.
The sea and wind do then obey
And sighing, sighing double notes
Of double basses, content to play
A droning chord for the little throats—
The little throats that sing and rise
Up into the light with lovely ease
And a kind of magical, sweet surprise
To hear and know themselves for these—
For these little voices: the bee, the fly,
The leaf that taps, the pod that breaks,
The breeze on the grass-tops bending by,
The shrill quick sound that the insect makes."
Drift,"The gold March dawn
and below my window 
a man carves his car
from the snow heap
plowed up around it.
So easy not to envy
the cold muscled task
but then imagine—
feeling your heartbeat
alive like a chipmunk
at work in your chest,
imagine the whole day
arm-sore and good
with accomplishment,
the day you begin
with heavy breath
and see it linger
outside your body
like a negative of
the dark air cavity
in you like the spirit
in you like the ghost."
The Heedless Shepherd,"Grief is a family going down one by one 
Wild buffalo tread on thin medallions 
It’s a sin to be born poor
It’s treason to stay that way
On the way to work at Fort Hood
Shepherd fell in love with a cherry 
Mother wore a red gingham apron 
While plating macaroni on the base
At home her daughter sat under an eye
That lost her in a blind spot 
Back then work had a weight you could feel it
After the war the father got a son
Quilts are folded like flags in the cupboard 
The morning shepherd left 
We drained a pitcher of cheap wine 
Our ancestors had robbed and been robbed 
And now everything was a mess"
As a Father of Daughters,"As a fathom of waters 
 
As a keeper of otters 
 
As a fan of the Dodgers 
 
As a foremost scholar 
 
As a leaver of mothers 
 
As a giver of quarters 
 
As a failure of rathers 
 
As a faithful supporter 
 
As we gather together 
 
As a fear of disorder 
 
As a phantom of operas 
 
As defender of borders 
 
As a frayer of wires 
 
As a friend of the doctor’s 
 
As an author of gospels 
 
As a field after slaughter"
"It Bruises, Too","The haunting has killed before.
Find words to describe the stone
heavy in the bowels. Before us
are the disasters we make
of our lives. I am a clumsy
journeyman. You find me on
a road that curls across green
plains. You see me with my staff
from so many miles away. We follow
the contours the mountains
make of the road until, hours
later, after two light showers
and a burst of sunlight we
meet. I tell you I am doing
penance. I promise that these
words I am speaking are the breaking
of a long fast, and my voice
sounds alien even to me.
You ask why I wince like that.
“The silence,” I say. “It bruises, as well.”
And after the elation of this meeting,
we part, you towards the light, me
into the gloom you left behind."
Exodus,"Rank fennel and broom
Grown wanly beside
The cottage and room
We once occupied,
But sold for the snows!
The dahoon berry weeps in blood,
I know,
Watched by the crow—
I’ve seen both grow
In those weird wastes of Dixie!"
Alice,"Know you, winds that blow your course
    Down the verdant valleys,
That somewhere you must, perforce,
    Kiss the brow of Alice?
When her gentle face you find,
Kiss it softly, naughty wind.
Roses waving fair and sweet
    Thro' the garden alleys,
Grow into a glory meet
    For the eye of Alice;
Let the wind your offering bear
Of sweet perfume, faint and rare.
Lily holding crystal dew
    In your pure white chalice,
Nature kind hath fashioned you
    Like the soul of Alice;
It of purest white is wrought,
Filled with gems of crystal thought."
Ione,"I.
Ah, yes, 't is sweet still to remember,
    Though 't were less painful to forget;
For while my heart glows like an ember,
    Mine eyes with sorrow's drops are wet,
    And, oh, my heart is aching yet.
It is a law of mortal pain
    That old wounds, long accounted well,
    Beneath the memory's potent spell,
Will wake to life and bleed again.
So 't is with me; it might be better
    If I should turn no look behind,—
If I could curb my heart, and fetter
    From reminiscent gaze my mind,
    Or let my soul go blind—go blind!
But would I do it if I could?
    Nay! ease at such a price were spurned;
    For, since my love was once returned,
All that I suffer seemeth good.
I know, I know it is the fashion,
    When love has left some heart distressed,
To weight the air with wordful passion;
    But I am glad that in my breast
    I ever held so dear a guest.
Love does not come at every nod,
    Or every voice that calleth ""hasten;""
    He seeketh out some heart to chasten,
And whips it, wailing, up to God!
Love is no random road wayfarer
    Who Where he may must sip his glass.
Love is the King, the Purple-Wearer,
    Whose guard recks not of tree or grass
    To blaze the way that he may pass.
What if my heart be in the blast
    That heralds his triumphant way;
    Shall I repine, shall I not say:
""Rejoice, my heart, the King has passed!""
In life, each heart holds some sad story—
    The saddest ones are never told.
I, too, have dreamed of fame and glory,
    And viewed the future bright with gold;
    But that is as a tale long told.
Mine eyes have lost their youthful flash,
    My cunning hand has lost its art;
    I am not old, but in my heart
The ember lies beneath the ash.
I loved! Why not? My heart was youthful,
    My mind was filled with healthy thought.
He doubts not whose own self is truthful,
    Doubt by dishonesty is taught;
    So loved I boldly, fearing naught.
I did not walk this lowly earth;
    Mine was a newer, higher sphere,
    Where youth was long and life was dear,
And all save love was little worth.
Her likeness! Would that I might limn it,
    As Love did, with enduring art;
Nor dust of days nor death may dim it,
    Where it lies graven on my heart,
    Of this sad fabric of my life a part.
I would that I might paint her now
    As I beheld her in that day,
    Ere her first bloom had passed away,
And left the lines upon her brow.
A face serene that, beaming brightly,
    Disarmed the hot sun's glances bold.
A foot that kissed the ground so lightly,
    He frowned in wrath and deemed her cold,
    But loved her still though he was old.
A form where every maiden grace
    Bloomed to perfection's richest flower,—
    The statued pose of conscious power,
Like lithe-limbed Dian's of the chase.
Beneath a brow too fair for frowning,
    Like moon-lit deeps that glass the skies
Till all the hosts above seem drowning,
    Looked forth her steadfast hazel eyes,
    With gaze serene and purely wise.
And over all, her tresses rare,
    Which, when, with his desire grown weak,
    The Night bent down to kiss her cheek,
Entrapped and held him captive there.
This was Ione; a spirit finer
    Ne'er burned to ash its house of clay;
A soul instinct with fire diviner
    Ne'er fled athwart the face of day,
    And tempted Time with earthly stay.
Her loveliness was not alone
    Of face and form and tresses' hue;
    For aye a pure, high soul shone through
Her every act: this was Ione.
II.
'T was in the radiant summer weather,
    When God looked, smiling, from the sky;
And we went wand'ring much together
    By wood and lane, Ione and I,
    Attracted by the subtle tie
Of common thoughts and common tastes,
    Of eyes whose vision saw the same,
    And freely granted beauty's claim
Where others found but worthless wastes.
We paused to hear the far bells ringing
    Across the distance, sweet and clear.
We listened to the wild bird's singing
    The song he meant for his mate's ear,
    And deemed our chance to do so dear.
We loved to watch the warrior Sun,
    With flaming shield and flaunting crest,
    Go striding down the gory West,
When Day's long fight was fought and won.
And life became a different story;
    Where'er I looked, I saw new light.
Earth's self assumed a greater glory,
    Mine eyes were cleared to fuller sight.
    Then first I saw the need and might
Of that fair band, the singing throng,
    Who, gifted with the skill divine,
    Take up the threads of life, spun fine,
And weave them into soulful song.
They sung for me, whose passion pressing
    My soul, found vent in song nor line.
They bore the burden of expressing
    All that I felt, with art's design,
    And every word of theirs was mine.
I read them to Ione, ofttimes,
    By hill and shore, beneath fair skies,
    And she looked deeply in mine eyes,
And knew my love spoke through their rhymes.
Her life was like the stream that floweth,
    And mine was like the waiting sea;
Her love was like the flower that bloweth,
    And mine was like the searching bee—
    I found her sweetness all for me.
God plied him in the mint of time,
    And coined for us a golden day,
    And rolled it ringing down life's way
With love's sweet music in its chime.
And God unclasped the Book of Ages,
    And laid it open to our sight;
Upon the dimness of its pages,
    So long consigned to rayless night,
    He shed the glory of his light.
We read them well, we read them long,
    And ever thrilling did we see
    That love ruled all humanity,—
The master passion, pure and strong.
III.
To-day my skies are bare and ashen,
    And bend on me without a beam.
Since love is held the master-passion,
    Its loss must be the pain supreme—
    And grinning Fate has wrecked my dream.
But pardon, dear departed Guest,
    I will not rant, I will not rail;
    For good the grain must feel the flail;
There are whom love has never blessed.
I had and have a younger brother,
    One whom I loved and love to-day
As never fond and doting mother
    Adored the babe who found its way
    From heavenly scenes into her day.
Oh, he was full of youth's new wine,—
    A man on life's ascending slope,
    Flushed with ambition, full of hope;
And every wish of his was mine.
A kingly youth; the way before him
    Was thronged with victories to be won;
So joyous, too, the heavens o'er him
    Were bright with an unchanging sun,—
    His days with rhyme were overrun.
Toil had not taught him Nature's prose,
    Tears had not dimmed his brilliant eyes,
    And sorrow had not made him wise;
His life was in the budding rose.
I know not how I came to waken,
    Some instinct pricked my soul to sight;
My heart by some vague thrill was shaken,—
    A thrill so true and yet so slight,
    I hardly deemed I read aright.
As when a sleeper, ign'rant why,
    Not knowing what mysterious hand
    Has called him out of slumberland,
Starts up to find some danger nigh.
Love is a guest that comes, unbidden,
    But, having come, asserts his right;
He will not be repressed nor hidden.
    And so my brother's dawning plight
    Became uncovered to my sight.
Some sound-mote in his passing tone
    Caught in the meshes of my ear;
    Some little glance, a shade too dear,
Betrayed the love he bore Ione.
What could I do? He was my brother,
    And young, and full of hope and trust;
I could not, dared not try to smother
    His flame, and turn his heart to dust.
    I knew how oft life gives a crust
To starving men who cry for bread;
    But he was young, so few his days,
    He had not learned the great world's ways,
Nor Disappointment's volumes read.
However fair and rich the booty,
    I could not make his loss my gain.
For love is dear, but dearer, duty,
    And here my way was clear and plain.
    I saw how I could save him pain.
And so, with all my day grown dim,
    That this loved brother's sun might shine,
    I joined his suit, gave over mine,
And sought Ione, to plead for him.
I found her in an eastern bower,
    Where all day long the am'rous sun
Lay by to woo a timid flower.
    This day his course was well-nigh run,
    But still with lingering art he spun
Gold fancies on the shadowed wall.
    The vines waved soft and green above,
    And there where one might tell his love,
I told my griefs—I told her all!
I told her all, and as she hearkened,
    A tear-drop fell upon her dress.
With grief her flushing brow was darkened;
    One sob that she could not repress
    Betrayed the depths of her distress.
Upon her grief my sorrow fed,
    And I was bowed with unlived years,
    My heart swelled with a sea of tears,
The tears my manhood could not shed.
The world is Rome, and Fate is Nero,
    Disporting in the hour of doom.
God made us men; times make the hero—
    But in that awful space of gloom
    I gave no thought but sorrow's room.
All—all was dim within that bower,
    What time the sun divorced the day;
    And all the shadows, glooming gray,
Proclaimed the sadness of the hour.
She could not speak—no word was needed;
    Her look, half strength and half despair,
Told me I had not vainly pleaded,
    That she would not ignore my prayer.
    And so she turned and left me there,
And as she went, so passed my bliss;
    She loved me, I could not mistake—
    But for her own and my love's sake,
Her womanhood could rise to this!
My wounded heart fled swift to cover,
    And life at times seemed very drear.
My brother proved an ardent lover—
    What had so young a man to fear?
    He wed Ione within the year.
No shadow clouds her tranquil brow,
    Men speak her husband's name with pride,
    While she sits honored at his side—
She is—she must be happy now!
I doubt the course I took no longer,
    Since those I love seem satisfied.
The bond between them will grow stronger
    As they go forward side by side;
    Then will my pains be justified.
Their joy is mine, and that is best—
    I am not totally bereft,
    For I have still the mem'ry left—
Love stopped with me—a Royal Guest!"
The Burned Child,"LOVE has had his way with me.
      This my heart is torn and maimed
Since he took his play with me.
    Cruel well the bow-boy aimed,
Shot, and saw the feathered shaft
    Dripping bright and bitter red.
He that shrugged his wings and laughed––
    Better had he left me dead.
Sweet, why do you plead me, then,
    Who have bled so sore of that?
Could I bear it once again? . . .
    Drop a hat, dear, drop a hat!"
Neither Bloody Nor Bowed,"THEY say of me, and so they should,
It’s doubtful if I come to good.
I see acquaintances and friends
Accumulating dividends,
And making enviable names
In science, art, and parlor games.
But I, despite expert advice,
Keep doing things I think are nice,
And though to good I never come––
Inseparable my nose and thumb!"
Experience,"SOME men break your heart in two,
     Some men fawn and flatter,
Some men never look at you;
    And that cleans up the matter."
Song in a Minor Key,"THERE’S a place I know where the birds swing low,
       And wayward vines go roaming,
Where the lilacs nod, and a marble god
    Is pale, in scented gloaming.
And at sunset there comes a lady fair
    Whose eyes are deep with yearning.
By an old, old gate does the lady wait
    Her own true love’s returning.
But the days go by, and the lilacs die,
    And trembling birds seek cover;
Yet the lady stands, with her long white hands
    Held out to greet her lover.
And it’s there she’ll stay till the shadowy day
    A monument they grave her.
She will always wait by the same old gate,––
    The gate her true love gave her."
Interview,"The ladies men admire, I’ve heard,
Would shudder at a wicked word.
Their candle gives a single light;
They’d rather stay at home at night.
They do not keep awake till three,
Nor read erotic poetry,
They never sanction the impure,
Nor recognize an overture.
They shrink from powders and from paints . . .
So far, I’ve had no complaints."
Nocturne,"ALWAYS I knew that it could not last
          (Gathering clouds, and the snowflakes flying),
Now it is part of the golden past;
    (Darkening skies, and the night-wind sighing)
It is but cowardice to pretend.
    Cover with ashes our love’s cold crater,––
Always I’ve known that it had to end
    Sooner or later.
Always I knew it would come like this
    (Pattering rain, and the grasses springing),
Sweeter to you is a new love’s kiss
    (Flickering sunshine, and young birds singing).
Gone are the raptures that once we knew,
    Now you are finding a new joy greater,––
Well, I’ll be doing the same thing, too,
    Sooner or later."
Biographies,"                           1.
  NOW this is the story of Lucy Brown,
A glittering jewel in virtue’s crown.
From earliest youth, she aspired to please.
She never fell down and dirtied her knees;
She put all her pennies in savings banks;
She never omitted her “please” and “thanks”;
She swallowed her spinach without a squawk;
And patiently listened to Teacher’s talk;
She thoughtfully stepped over worms and ants;
And earnestly watered the potted plants;
She didn’t disremember expensive toys;
And never would play with the little boys.
And when to young womanhood Lucy came
Her mode of behavior was just the same.
She always was safe in her home at dark;
And never went riding around the park;
She wouldn’t put powder upon her nose;
And petticoats sheltered her spotless hose;
She knew how to market and mend and sweep;
By quarter-past ten, she was sound asleep;
In presence of elders, she held her tongue––
The way that they did when the world was young.
And people remarked, in benign accord,
“You’ll see that she gathers her just reward.”
Observe, their predictions were more than fair.
She married an affluent millionaire
So gallant and handsome and wise and gay,
And rated in Bradstreet at Double A.
And she lived with him happily all her life,
And made him a perfectly elegant wife.
                                     2.
  Now Marigold Jones, from her babyhood,
Was bad as the model Miss Brown was good.
She stuck out her tongue at her grieving nurse;
She frequently rifled her Grandma’s purse;
She banged on the table and broke the plates;
She jeered at the passing inebriates;
And tore all her dresses and ripped her socks;
And shattered the windows with fair-sized rocks;
The words on the fences she’d memorize;
She blackened her dear little brother’s eyes;
And cut off her sister’s abundant curls;
And never would play with the little girls.
And when she grew up––as is hardly strange––
Her manner of life underwent no change
But faithfully followed her childhood plan.
And once there was talk of a married man!
She sauntered in public in draperies
Affording no secrecy to her knees;
She constantly uttered what was not true;
She flirted and petted, or what have you;
And, tendered advice by her kind Mamma,
Her answer, I shudder to state, was “Blah!”
And people remarked, in sepulchral tones,
“You’ll see what becomes of Marigold Jones.”
Observe, their predictions were more than fair.
She married an affluent millionaire
So gallant and handsome and wise and gay,
And rated in Bradstreet at Double A.
And she lived with him happily all her life,
And made him a perfectly elegant wife."
Pictures in the Smoke,"OH, gallant was the first love, and glittering and fine;
       The second love was water, in a clear white cup;
The third love was his, and the fourth was mine;
    And after that, I always get them all mixed up.
 "
Inscription for the Ceiling of a Bedroom,"DAILY dawns another day;
I must up, to make my way.
Though I dress and drink and eat,
Move my fingers and my feet,
Learn a little, here and there,
Weep and laugh and sweat and swear,
Hear a song, or watch a stage,
Leave some words upon a page,
Claim a foe, or hail a friend––
Bed awaits me at the end.
Though I go in pride and strength,
I’ll come back to bed at length.
Though I walk in blinded woe,
Back to bed I’m bound to go.
High my heart, or bowed my head,
All my days but lead to bed.
Up, and out, and on; and then
Ever back to bed again,
Summer, Winter, Spring, and Fall––
I’m a fool to rise at all!"
General Review of the Sex Situation,"WOMAN wants monogamy;
Man delights in novelty.
Love is woman’s moon and sun;
Man has other forms of fun.
Woman lives but in her lord;
Count to ten, and man is bored.
With this the gist and sum of it,
What earthly good can come of it?"
L’ENVOI:,"Prince, I’m packing away the rue.
I’ll give them something to shout “Hooray” at.
I’ve got somebody else in view:
And love is a game that two can play at."
Ballade of Big Plans,"She loved him. He knew it. And love was a game that two
                      could play at.––“Julia Cane,” p. 280
ONCE the orioles sang in chorus,
Once the skies were a cloudless blue.
Spring bore blossoms expressly for us,
Stars lined up to spell “Y-O-U.”
All the world wore a golden hue,
Life was a thing to be bold and gay at;
Love was the only game I knew,
And love is a game that two can play at.
Now the heavens are scowling o’er us,
Now the blossoms are pale and few.
Love was a rose with thorns that tore us,
Love was a ship without a crew.
Love is untender, and love is untrue,
Love is a moon for a dog to bay at,
Love is the Lady-That’s-Known-as-Lou,
And love is a game that two can play at.
Recollections can only bore us;
Now it’s over, and now it’s through.
Our day is dead as a dinosaurus.
Other the paths that you pursue.
What is the girl in the case to do?
What is she going to spend her day at?
Fun demands, at a minimum, two­­––
And love is a game that two can play at."
The Choice,"HE’D have given me rolling lands,
       Houses of marble, and billowing farms,
Pearls, to trickle between my hands,
   Smoldering rubies, to circle my arms.
You––you’d only a lilting song,
   Only a melody, happy and high,
You were sudden and swift and strong,––
   Never a thought for another had I.
He’d have given me laces rare,
   Dresses that glimmered with frosty sheen,
Shining ribbons to wrap my hair,
   Horses to draw me, as fine as a queen.
You––you’d only to whistle low,
   Gaily I followed wherever you led.
I took you, and I let him go,––
   Somebody ought to examine my head!"
Autobiography,"OH, both my shoes are shiny new,
     And pristine is my hat;
My dress is 1922. . . .
    My life is all like that."
Rondeau Redoublé,"(AND SCARCELY WORTH THE TROUBLE, AT THAT)
THE same to me are sombre days and gay.
      Though joyous dawns the rosy morn, and bright,
Because my dearest love is gone away
    Within my heart is melancholy night.
My heart beats low in loneliness, despite
    That riotous Summer holds the earth in sway.
In cerements my spirit is bedight;
    The same to me are sombre days and gay.
Though breezes in the rippling grasses play,
    And waves dash high and far in glorious might,
I thrill no longer to the sparkling day,
    Though joyous dawns the rosy morn, and bright.
Ungraceful seems to me the swallow’s flight;
    As well might Heaven’s blue be sullen gray;
My soul discerns no beauty in their sight
    Because my dearest love is gone away.
Let roses fling afar their crimson spray,
    And virgin daisies splash the fields with white,
Let bloom the poppy hotly as it may,
    Within my heart is melancholy night.
And this, oh love, my pitiable plight
    Whenever from my circling arms you stray;
This little world of mine has lost its light. . . .
    I hope to God, my dear, that you can say
                                                    The same to me."
Fighting Words,"SAY my love is easy had,
      Say I’m bitten raw with pride,
Say I am too often sad,––
   Still behold me at your side.
Say I’m neither brave nor young,
   Say I woo and coddle care,
Say the devil touched my tongue,––
   Still you have my heart to wear.
But say my verses do not scan,
   And I get me another man!"
Symptom Recital,"I DO not like my state of mind;
I’m bitter, querulous, unkind.
I hate my legs, I hate my hands,
I do not yearn for lovelier lands.
I dread the dawn’s recurrent light;
I hate to go to bed at night.
I snoot at simple, earnest folk.
I cannot take the gentlest joke.
I find no peace in paint or type.
My world is but a lot of tripe.
I’m disillusioned, empty-breasted.
For what I think, I’d be arrested.
I am not sick, I am not well.
My quondam dreams are shot to hell.
My soul is crushed, my spirit sore;
I do not like me any more.
I cavil, quarrel, grumble, grouse.
I ponder on the narrow house.
I shudder at the thought of men. . . .
I’m due to fall in love again."
Observation,"If I don’t drive around the park,
I’m pretty sure to make my mark.
If I’m in bed each night by ten,
I may get back my looks again,
If I abstain from fun and such,
I’ll probably amount to much,
But I shall stay the way I am,
Because I do not give a damn."
Religion,"I am no priest of crooks nor creeds,
For human wants and human needs
Are more to me than prophets' deeds;
And human tears and human cares
Affect me more than human prayers.
Go, cease your wail, lugubrious saint!
You fret high Heaven with your plaint.
Is this the ""Christian's joy"" you paint?
Is this the Christian's boasted bliss?
Avails your faith no more than this?
Take up your arms, come out with me,
Let Heav'n alone; humanity
Needs more and Heaven less from thee.
With pity for mankind look 'round;
Help them to rise—and Heaven is found."
Conscience and Remorse,"""Good-bye,"" I said to my conscience—
    ""Good-bye for aye and aye,""
And I put her hands off harshly,
    And turned my face away;
And conscience smitten sorely
    Returned not from that day.
But a time came when my spirit
    Grew weary of its pace;
And I cried: ""Come back, my conscience;
    I long to see thy face.""
But conscience cried: ""I cannot;
    Remorse sits in my place."""
The Lover And The Moon,"A lover whom duty called over the wave,
With himself communed: ""Will my love be true
If left to herself? Had I better not sue
Some friend to watch over her, good and grave?
But my friend might fail in my need,"" he said,
""And I return to find love dead.
Since friendships fade like the flow'rs of June,
I will leave her in charge of the stable moon.""

Then he said to the moon: ""O dear old moon,
Who for years and years from thy throne above
Hast nurtured and guarded young lovers and love,
My heart has but come to its waiting June,
And the promise time of the budding vine;
Oh, guard thee well this love of mine.""
And he harked him then while all was still,
And the pale moon answered and said, 'I will.'

And he sailed in his ship o'er many seas,
And he wandered wide o'er strange far strands:
in isles of the south and in Orient lands,
Where pestilence lurks in the breath of the breeze.
But his star was high, so he braved the main,
And sailed him blithely home again;
And with joy he bended his footsteps soon
To learn of his love from the matron moon.

She sat as of yore, in her olden place,
Serene as death, in her silver chair.
A white rose gleamed in her whiter hair,
And the tint of a blush was on her face.
At sight of the youth she sadly bowed
And hid her face 'neath a gracious cloud.
She faltered faint on the night's dim marge,
But ""How,"" spoke the youth, ""have you kept your charge?""

The moon was sad at a trust ill-kept;
The blush went out in her blanching cheek,
And her voice was timid and low and weak,
As she made her plea and sighed and wept.
'Oh, another prayed and another plead,
And I couldn't resist,"" she answering said;
""But love still grows in the hearts of men:
Go forth, dear youth, and love again.""

But he turned him away from her proffered grace.
""Thou art false, O moon, as the hearts of men,
I will not, will not love again.""
And he turned sheer 'round with a soul-sick face
To the sea, and cried: ""Sea, curse the moon,
Who makes her vows and forgets so soon.""
And the awful sea with anger stirred,
And his breast heaved hard as he lay and heard.

And ever the moon wept down in rain,
And ever her sighs rose high in wind;
But the earth and sea were deaf and blind,
And she wept and sighed her griefs in vain.
And ever at night, when the storm is fierce,
The cries of a wraith through the thunders pierce;
And the waves strain their awful hands on high
To tear the false moon from the sky."
Empty,"I don’t want to see
what spilled out,
blue clay jug of dreams
toppled at the head of his pallet
found at dawn,
every drop of future
gone. 
 "
My Memories Live in my Mother’s Phone,"Her dress shimmered tiny pink and green flower gardens
like a tablecloth in a rural twentieth century 
American farmhouse, something tender
you never saw since you were a child too,
pleats and folds along the bodice,
tucks and stitchery made with a patience
that barely abides anymore, her hair tightly braided
and coiled in circles against her perfect head
with tiny red ribbons at elegant intervals,
but when you said, Memories, her face fell.
She whispered, we left them, we had to 
leave everything in our house, 
my cabinet, my doll, my books,
my pepper plant, my pillow.
Nothing now we knew before.
But we have a few pictures.
My memories live in my mother’s phone. 
 "
What She Said,"A woman on a plane said No!
We didn’t want your bombs 
and guns. We didn’t want them 
setting up camps
making secret plans
crisscrossing our mountains
dressed in combat gear.
Those helicopters scared us.
We wanted girls in school, yes,
freedom for women, always,
how can there not be freedom
for the source of life?
But more war, battles, 
years of dead villagers 
sprawled under 
pine nut trees, why?
Why not simpler things,
more schools,
larger hospitals,
food?
There would have been
Better things to do.

Green Shirt,"His mother did not wash it for this, 
for him to be carried dead by two friends
across the thirsty ground of Gaza.
That morning he put it on, she told him
he looked handsome, a fine deep color
for an unfolding day. 
 "
The Rivals,"‘Twas three an’ thirty year ago,
I When I was ruther young, you know,
I had my last an’ only fight
About a gal one summer night.
‘Twas me an’ Zekel Johnson; Zeke
‘N’ me’d be’n spattin’ ‘bout a week,
Each of us tryin’ his best to show
That he was Liza Jones’s beau.
We couldn’t neither prove the thing,
Fur she was fur too sharp to fling
One over fur the other one
An’ by so doin’ stop the fun
That we chaps didn't have the sense
To see she got at our expense,
But that’s the way a feller does,
Fur boys is fools an’ allus was.
An’ when they’s females in the game
I reckon men’s about the same.
Well, Zeke an’ me went on that way
An’ fussed an’ quarrelled day by day;
While Liza, mindin’ not the fuss,
Jest kep’ a-goin’ with both of us,
Tell we pore chaps, that’s Zeke an’ me,
Was jest plum mad with jealousy.
Well, fur a time we kep’ our places,
An’ only showed by frownin’ faces
An’ looks ’at well our meanin’ boded
How full o’ fight we both was loaded.
At last it come, the thing broke out,
An’ this is how it come about.
One night (’t was fair, you’ll all agree)
I got Eliza’s company,
An’ leavin’ Zekel in the lurch,
Went trottin’ off with her to church.
An’ jest as we had took our seat
(Eliza lookin’ fair an’ sweet),
Why, I jest couldn’t help but grin
When Zekel come a-bouncin’ in
As furious as the law allows.
He’d jest be’n up to Liza’s house,
To find her gone, then come to church
To have this end put to his search.
I guess I laffed that meetin’ through,
An’ not a mortal word I knew
Of what the preacher preached er read
Er what the choir sung er said.
Fur every time I’d turn my head
I couldn’t skeercely help but see
’At Zekel had his eye on me.
An’ he ’ud sort o’ turn an’ twist
An’ grind his teeth an’ shake his fist.
I laughed, fur la! the hull church seen us,
An’ knowed that suthin’ was between us.
Well, meetin’ out, we started hum,
I sorter feelin’ what would come.
We’d jest got out, when up stepped Zeke,
An’ said, ""Scuse me, I’d like to speak
To you a minute."" ""Cert,"" said I—
A-nudgin’ Liza on the sly
An’ laughin’ in my sleeve with glee,
I asked her, please, to pardon me.
We walked away a step er two,
Jest to git out o’ Liza's view,
An’ then Zeke said, ""I want to know
Ef you think you’re Eliza’s beau,
An’ ’at I’m goin’ to let her go
Hum with sich a chap as you?""
An’ I said bold, ‘You bet I do.’
Then Zekel, sneerin’, said ’at he
Didn’t want to hender me.
But then he ’lowed the gal was his
An’ ’at he guessed he knowed his biz,
An’ wasn’t feared o’ all my kin
With all my friends an’ chums throwed in.
Some other things he mentioned there
That no born man could no ways bear
Er think o’ ca’mly tryin’ to stan’
Ef Zeke had be’n the bigges’ man
In town, an’ not the leanest runt
’At time an’ labor ever stunt.
An’ so I let my fist go ""bim,""
I thought I’d mos’ nigh finished him.
But Zekel didn’t take it so.
He jest ducked down an’ dodged my blow
An’ then come back at me so hard,
I guess I must ’a’ hurt the yard,
Er spilet the grass plot where I fell,
An’ sakes alive it hurt me; well,
It wouldn't be’n so bad, you see,
But he jest kep’ a-hittin’ me.
An’ I hit back an’ kicked an’ pawed,
But ’t seemed ’twas mostly air I clawed,
While Zekel used his science well
A-makin’ every motion tell.
He punched an’ hit, why, goodness lands,
Seemed like he had a dozen hands.
Well, afterwhile they stopped the fuss,
An’ some one kindly parted us.
All beat an’ cuffed an’ clawed an’ scratched,
An’ needin’ both our faces patched,
Each started hum a different way;
An’ what o’ Liza, do you say,
Why, Liza—little humbug—dern her,
Why, she’d gone home with Hiram Turner."
To Louise,"Oh, the poets may sing of their Lady Irenes,
And may rave in their rhymes about wonderful queens;
But I throw my poetical wings to the breeze,
And soar in a song to my Lady Louise.
A sweet little maid, who is dearer, I ween,
Than any fair duchess, or even a queen.
When speaking of her I can't plod in my prose,
For she's the wee lassie who gave me a rose.
Since poets, from seeing a lady's lip curled,
Have written fair verse that has sweetened the world;
Why, then, should not I give the space of an hour
To making a song in return for a flower?
I have found in my life—it has not been so long—
There are too few of flowers—too little of song.
So out of that blossom, this lay of mine grows,
For the dear little lady who gave me the rose.
I thank God for innocence, dearer than Art,
That lights on a by-way which leads to the heart,
And led by an impulse no less than divine,
Walks into the temple and sits at the shrine.
I would rather pluck daisies that grow in the wild,
Or take one simple rose from the hand of a child,
Than to breathe the rich fragrance of flowers that bide
In the gardens of luxury, passion, and pride.
I know not, my wee one, how came you to know
Which way to my heart was the right way to go;
Unless in your purity, soul-clean and clear,
God whispers his messages into your ear.
You have now had my song, let me end with a prayer
That your life may be always sweet, happy, and fair;
That your joys may be many, and absent your woes,
O dear little lady who gave me the rose!"
Spring Song,"A blue-bell springs upon the ledge,
A lark sits singing in the hedge;
Sweet perfumes scent the balmy air,
And life is brimming everywhere.
What lark and breeze and bluebird sing,
    Is Spring, Spring, Spring!
No more the air is sharp and cold;
The planter wends across the wold,
And, glad, beneath the shining sky
We wander forth, my love and I.
And ever in our hearts doth ring
    This song of Spring, Spring!
For life is life and love is love,
'Twixt maid and man or dove and dove.
Life may be short, life may be long,
But love will come, and to its song
Shall this refrain for ever cling
    Of Spring, Spring, Spring!"
Shadow,"Silhouette
On the face of the moon
Am I.
A dark shadow in the light.
A silhouette am I
On the face of the moon
Lacking color
Or vivid brightness
But defined all the clearer
Because
I am dark,
Black on the face of the moon.
A shadow am I
Growing in the light,
Not understood
As is the day,
But more easily seen
Because
I am a shadow in the light."
"The Sun, Mad Envious, Just Wants the Moon","out of the way. It knows that I tend to cling
to potential in the dark, that I am myself only
as I am beguiled by the moon’s lunatic luster,
when the streets are so bare they grow voices.
The sun has lost patience with my craving
for the night’s mass-produced romance, that
dog-eared story where every angle is exquisite,
and ghostly suitors, their sleek smells exploding,
queue up to ravish my waning. Bursting with
bluster, the sun backslaps the moon to reveal
me, splintered, kissing the boulevard face first,
clutching change for a jukebox that long ago
lost its hunger for quarters. It wounds the sun
to know how utterly I have slipped its gilded
clutch to become its most mapless lost cause.
Her eye bulging, she besieges me with bright.
So I remind her that everything dies. All the
brilliant bitch can do for me then is spit light
on the path while I search for a place to sleep."
God Could Not Make Her a Poet,"Thomas Jefferson said this, more or less,
After he read the musings of the clever African
Phillis Wheatley, a sensation of both the Colonies
And England, a black patriot, though a slave.
Whatever a black hand can build, he knew,
Could only be guided by a master’s vision,
Like this room of the mansion he probably
Wrote his opinion in—what black mind could
Dream in these proportions? And gather
The slope of these Virginia hills so lovingly
To his window? God could give her words,
But the subtle turn? Like giving a gull
A sack of gold."
Midnight Air in Louisville,"for Breonna Taylor
Dear Breonna,
How many times, I ask,
           how many times
have I chased the thought
                      of writing to you,
of catching the poem where
                      it cannot leave,
of knocking open the door to a grief
           we all hold, our hearts
full of questions.
           We leave our houses to work,
to look for what we need to live,
                      or what we need
           to make the pain go away,
and your voice rises:
           “Oh hell to the no,
no he didn’t,
           Satan get behind me,
whatever, whatever
           the hell you think you are.”
I imagine that in leaving 
all of us you said:
           “I am done
I am let out into the world,
           breath I took in from it
breath that I give back in love.”
May I see you in flight
filling the space
           beyond clouds and stars
where there is no need
           of sun or moon, where
a grand city lives
           in prophecies beaten
by the wheels of history
where you are not invisible
           to ancestors who saw
these long roads down through time
to this one night in Louisville.
                      Bright Angel,
Luminescence, Woman Who Saved Lives
in Emergency Rooms,
                      Invocation of Heaven’s Law,
Living Song Riding
                                 the Eternal Dawn.
These titles I summon from license
given by Eternal Mysteries to hold you.
Fly now, in the woven air of the saints."
My Dead Friends,"My friends are dead who were
the arches    the pillars of my life 
the structural relief when
the world gave none.
  My friends who knew me as I knew them
their bodies folded into the ground or burnt to ash.
If I got on my knees
might I lift my life as a turtle carries her home?  
  Who if I cried out would hear me?
My friends—with whom I might have spoken of this—are gone."
All the Time Blues Villanelle,"Hard to watch somebody lose their mind
Maybe everybody    should just go get stoned
My father said it happens all the time
I knew a woman    lost her to soul to wine
But who doesn’t live with their life on loan?
Shame to watch somebody lose their mind
Don’tchu gotta wonder when people say they’re fine?
Given what we’re given, I guess they actin grown
I think I used to say that      all the time
When my parents died, I coined a little shrine
And thought about all the stuff they used to own
Felt like I was gonna lose my mind
Used to have a friend    who smiled all the time
Then he started sayin he could hear the devil moan
Hate to see a brotha lose his gotdam mind
Doesn’t matter how you pull, the hours break the line
Mirror, Mirror on the wall, how come nobody’s home?
Broke my soul for real, when my mother lost her mind
Tried to keep my head right, but sanity’s a climb
Been workin on the straight face—I guess my cover’s blown
My father tried to tell me     all the time
Had one last question, baby, but maybe never mind
After’while, even springtime starts to drone
Hard to see somebody lose their mind
My pop said, “Boy, it happens all the time”"
We Pulled a Rose in Summer Time,"We pulled a rose in summer time
        Beside True Lover’s Gate,
Our lips sent up so sweet a chime,
        That twilight lingered late;
Now look how is the year grown old!—
        How leafless hedge and tree,—
’Tis said that even love grows cold,
        So here is rosemary."
My Aunt’s Angels,"They knock on cupboards & ribs,
steal mothballs from the wardrobe’s dim corners
& patch them into their wings.
They scream when the kettle boils.
Their feet & fingers are webbed like geese.
Some bake bran muffins in blue children’s aprons.
The kitchen, powdered in bread flour, a cloud they glide through.
Others wrestle the wind through a screen door.
When the doorbell rings, they flap their arms & chirp
their mockingbird throats.
They work in shifts, all night shining shoes.
All morning they brush her hair.
Some are secretive & break the chimes, so she won’t
know their comings & goings.
Others dissect the basement mice & pin
the decorative bodies, splayed like fans, to the walls.
Their laughter rakes like tires screeching through a stop.
She begs them to stop but they only start a game
of tar & feathers.
She opens the door to leave, but more trudge in
ferrying beer bottles & shoehorns, tiny mouse bones dangling
from their teeth.
Some plant violets in the garden then wash their feet
so the dirt won’t track in. Or so the violets won’t grow
inside. Some rock her to bed & call her baby;
others roll their doll eyes & bite her fingernails to shards as she sleeps.
She once woke to a fistful of blood & feathers, believing
it a tiny bird she’d crushed in sleep.
Tomorrow, she will take a pill & they will leave in a mournful parade:
When angels leave us, they look like lost children.
She will spend all day counting their shadows like stitches
& washing that dead bird from her fingers’ webs."
Palms.,"i.
I miss the rev of the minivan.
The time I turned too sharp off Harlem and dug
its battered side into a white van.
The tobacco glued to the man’s teeth as he yelled
and then realized that a minivan could do no harm
to his white van.
I miss pleading to my mother for the keys or slipping them
into my pocket, depending on the furrow of her brow.
And how I would drive the car until the red arrow just graced E
and then vacate for a week until the tank magically filled itself.
ii.
Driving at night is mostly like soaring,
like a pair of ice skates and the whole town,
your whole world, is frozen over. I’m always finding excuses
to run errands in the moon’s embrace, to slip
down the driveway into brake lights and exhaust pipes.
I know neon Jewel Osco like I know my own knuckles.
The checkout lady, a cool breeze as she makes up
a family for me and wonders why they let me go out every night,
for dish soap, tampons, a thank you card,
wonders why shopping has become my good-night kiss.
Sometimes I will take Harlem Ave. so far
that cross streets become strangers and I wonder if I say
hello enough times the world won’t feel so much
like a vengeful tongue.
iii.
I do not drive in Boston,
I take the train, the slow chug of the city’s arteries.
I step onto Comm Ave. after a car passes,
jacket blown open wide.
I remember the thrill of a sterling wheel
and a half an hour in which no one will call your name.
I daydream about Thanksgiving break
when I can shiver in the front seat,
puff clouds of smoke with the car as it awakes,
used to slumbering in its old age.
I will take the car down Harlem Ave.,
past Roosevelt Rd. where all the cross streets
turn to numbers and I will count on my fingers
the hours until I leave."
No Images,"She does not know
Her beauty,
She thinks her brown body
Has no glory.
If she could dance
Naked,
Under palm trees
And see her image in the river
She would know.
But there are no palm trees
On the street,
And dish water gives back no images."
The Flea,"“The flea,” that’s what the year-rounders call it,
rummaging through tools or bric-a-brac then
gossiping all day at their tables in the blistering sun,
their faded beach umbrellas barely shading the tarmac.
This is what my mother did in New Hampshire
Sunday after widowed Sunday, into her eighties.
Up at dawn, her wagon packed the night before—
by noon, willing to mark down anything not to have
to re-wrap and pack the whole kit and caboodle
for the sticky hundred mile drive home ….
Today, I pick up a teapot, white with a smattering
of pink and black and aqua stars, its flawed glaze
(a reject from the start), its jaunty asterisks,
its moderne form, manufactured in Syracuse
in the ’Fifties, pleases me, seven starry cups
and five chipped star-studded dinner plates—
ordinary optimistic dishes, probably used by one
Cape Cod family for decades, only dings
and cracks now to tell their homely provenance,
their good usage and keep the price down.
Not star-struck, my mother would have felt
the edges’ roughness with her thumb and found
them wanting. It wouldn’t have been the chips—
she treasured her miniatures, her broken “minnies”—
these just weren’t her thing. But like a ninny—
I can make something of this, can’t I?—I buy the lot
in her magpie memory, wrapped in old Globes,
for what a cappuccino would cost, or a Parisian mystery. "
Who Does This Feeling Belong To?,"I am nearly positive there are no other
Langston Kermans on this smoking earth.
Certainly not in this neighborhood.
How frightening to think
there might be another
who appropriates the prescription for my abscess,
who claims my lost packages,
who watches anime and sucks
juice between his teeth, the same as me.
I am 32 years old
and I have never known anyone’s
heart attacks in the morning shower.
No monoxide pumped into a closed garage.
No true loss.
Even my first dog lived to 17:
She died quietly on a metal table,
the family encircling her
like a fleshy halo.
Dearest “other” Langston,
how many eggs have you cracked
to find the yolk pecked with blood?"
Oak Park Mutters Statistics,"A website stutters numbers
about my town sheepishly
pushing them all the way
to the bottom
The percentage of residents living in poverty—8.5%
Then the parentheses:
(6% for white residents)
(9.6% for Hispanic residents)
(14.3% for Black residents)
I wonder why it is only the poverty statistic
that mentions race
Then I remember everything is about money
That in this cushy suburb racial bias loves to glare
back at you from the inside of a wallet
In this chunk of non-city
the people are proud
of their diversity
Even as the achievement
gap at my high school
glares at them
Back when the Chicago Tribune covered
the 1919 Chicago riots
they were overshadowed
by the streetcar strike which
inconvenienced white
people who had to find
other ways to get to work
I bet no Oak Park wife
looked toward the lake
and saw Black bodies
I wonder how many of their
children have done anything
other than cast problems under bottom lips
letting injustice sit with stale breath
Their “hate has no home here” lawn signs
resting in freshly trimmed grass
I can feel them eyeing me
questioning if I belong here
as I walk past
I think about pulling all the signs out
Telling my neighbors to learn their own statistics
Will they see me in parentheses?
A part of me hopes they don‘t
Is this why I straighten my hair
for every school picture?
So for those few minutes before class,
a teacher may see me as something
other than Latina
Is Oak Park the cut lawn
and the sign planted in it
or white women
standing proud behind their liberal yard signs?
Where does it fit in a world that would rather focus
on anything but the problems across the street?
I just hope that when Oak Park makes its choice
it will say it without muttering"
Standing by a Shelf,"for Reuben
When he looks at the edges,
The covers of books and records,
He remembers when and where
He got them, how it felt.
Everything’s a testament
To life lived on the fringe
Of some sense of sanity.
All the vehicles for imbibing
These treasures are obsolete.
Even his eyes and ears, as their
Function fades under each year’s
Mud and tussle to stay alive
The damned fine few who know
Try not to lose the memories,
Talk as if each was there
For the other, laughter supplants tears.
If he can, a story gets written
About each song, how a chord
A lyric, the last line of a book
Make more sense, the same as the
Warnings his mother threw
at fledgling feet like seeds in soil.
He wishes he could buy them all again,
Heed the messages, grow as if
Each signpost was a vitamin
Make what became a recollection
A catalyst for pathfinding and strength."
Why So This Quiet,"            Dog lifts his leg to piss on the bull briar; pisses;
and up from the twists and thorns flies a ghost moth,
two of them, three, moving like an abandoned
but still persuasive, still shifting argument,
            until as usual they move how they move, even as
the field’s edge means the edge of the field, not
the shadow-stitched perimeter of childhood
            where someone’s explaining to me all over again
“A whip is not a lasso,” losing patience,
while someone else strikes a match, sets fire
                         to a box of maple leaves—desire—“No,
                         the leaves are what desire looks like, not how it feels.”"
Late Afternoon Stroll on the Cliffs,"As usual, Death sweetly slips her arm in mine—
& we take a deep breath from the eucalyptus breeze.
We both worked honestly at our jobs: all day Death
destroyed traffic with wailing ambulances while I killed
hours & lines on eight-&-a-half by eleven inch pages.
We’re fast friends by now, Death much older of course,
but there’s no hierarchy between us: we’re both taking
a break from it all, glad to watch waves collapse on rocks
& pelicans dive-bomb fish. I try to be sensitive to Death’s
guilt: that whole pandemic disaster she can no longer
control. She’ll soon betray me too—like she will you. 
I know. But today the gulls are silver angels etching
great cursive blessings in a perfect sky—so Death & I
make believe we believe that, & amble on."
Crossing the Line,"for Maria
Sitting across the table from you
I think back to when our friendship
came down from the mountains.
It was a cold day and the miners
had not left for work.
  You break a cookie in half like bread
and this sharing is what we both now need.
That which breaks into crumbs are memories.
Your gray hair cut short and you ask if I notice.
  How can I tell you that Bolivia will always be
beautiful and everything I notice is you
and yes is you. Our napkins folded in our hands.
Folded as if our meeting now is prayer.
  Did I ever tell you that your eyes are a map
and I would lose myself if you ever turned away"
Pierrot,"I work all day,
Said Simple John,
Myself a house to buy.
I work all day,
Said Simple John,
But Pierrot wondered why.
For Pierrot loved the long white road,
And Pierrot loved the moon,
And Pierrot loved a star-filled sky,
And the breath of a rose in June.
I have one wife,
Said Simple John,
And, faith, I love her yet.
I have one wife,
Said Simple John,
But Pierrot left Pierrette.
For Pierrot saw a world of girls,
And Pierrot loved each one,
And Pierrot thought all maidens fair
As flowers in the sun.
Oh, I am good,
Said Simple John,
The Lord will take me in.
Yes, I am good,
Said Simple John,
But Pierrot's steeped in sin.
For Pierrot played on a slim guitar,
And Pierrot loved the moon,
And Pierrot ran down the long white road
With the burgher’s wife one June."
Poem—To the Black Beloved,"Ah,
My black one,
Thou art not beautiful
Yet thou hast
A loveliness
Surpassing beauty.
Oh,
My black one,
Thou art not good
Yet thou hast
A purity
Surpassing goodness.
Ah,
My black one,
Thou art not luminous
Yet an altar of jewels,
An altar of shimmering jewels,
Would pale in the light
Of thy darkness,
Pale in the light
Of thy nightness."
Ardella,"I would liken you
To a night without stars
Were it not for your eyes.
I would liken you
To a sleep without dreams
Were it not for your songs."
Songs to the Dark Virgin,"I.
Would
That I were a jewel,
A shattered jewel,
That all my shining brilliants
Might fall at thy feet,
Thou dark one.
II.
Would
That I were a garment,
A shimmering, silken garment,
That all my folds
Might wrap about thy body,
Absorb thy body,
Hold and hide thy body,
Thou dark one.
III.
Would
That I were a flame,
But one sharp, leaping flame
To annihilate thy body,
Thou dark one."
Harlem Night Song,"Come,
Let us roam the night together
Singing.
I love you.
Across
The Harlem roof-tops
Moon is shining
Night sky is blue.
Stars are great drops
Of golden dew.
In the cabaret
The jazz-band’s playing.
I love you.
Come,
Let us roam the night together
Singing."
Song of Summer,"Dis is gospel weathah sho’—

Unexpressed,"Deep in my heart that aches with the repression,
    And strives with plenitude of bitter pain,
There lives a thought that clamors for expression,
    And spends its undelivered force in vain.

What boots it that some other may have thought it?
    The right of thoughts’ expression is divine;
The price of pain I pay for it has bought it,
    I care not who lays claim to it —‘t is mine!

And yet not mine until it be delivered;
    The manner of its birth shall prove the test.
Alas, alas, my rock of pride is shivered—
    I beat my brow—the thought still unexpressed."
Lenox Avenue: Midnight,"The rhythm of life
Is a jazz rhythm,
Honey.
The gods are laughing at us.
The broken heart of love,
The weary, weary heart of pain,—
       Overtones,
       Undertones,
To the rumble of street cars,
To the swish of rain.
Lenox Avenue,
Honey.
Midnight,
And the gods are laughing at us."
Retrospection,"When you and I were young, the days
    Were filled with scent of pink and rose,
    And full of joy from dawn till close,
From morning’s mist till evening’s haze.
    And when the robin sung his song
    The verdant woodland ways along,
      We whistled louder than he sung.
And school was joy, and work was sport
For which the hours were all too short,
    When you and I were young, my boy,
      When you and I were young.
When you and I were young, the woods
    Brimmed bravely o’er with every joy
    To charm the happy-hearted boy.
The quail turned out her timid broods;
    The prickly copse, a hostess fine,
    Held high black cups of harmless wine;
      And low the laden grape-vine swung
With beads of night-kissed amethyst
Where buzzing lovers held their tryst,
    When you and I were young, my boy,
      When you and I were young.
When you and I were young, the cool
    And fresh wind fanned our fevered brows
    When tumbling o'er the scented mows,
Or stripping by the dimpling pool,
    Sedge-fringed about its shimmering face,
    Save where we'd worn an ent'ring place.
      How with our shouts the calm banks rung!
How flashed the spray as we plunged in,—
Pure gems that never caused a sin!
    When you and I were young, my boy,
      When you and I were young.
When you and I were young, we heard
    All sounds of Nature with delight,—
    The whirr of wing in sudden flight,
The chirping of the baby-bird.
    The columbine’s red bells were rung;
    The locust’s vested chorus sung;
      While every wind his zithern strung
To high and holy-sounding keys,
And played sonatas in the trees—
    When you and I were young, my boy,
      When you and I were young.
When you and I were young, we knew
    To shout and laugh, to work and play,
    And night was partner to the day
In all our joys. So swift time flew
    On silent wings that, ere we wist,
    The fleeting years had fled unmissed;
      And from our hearts this cry was wrung—
To fill with fond regret and tears
The days of our remaining years—
    ""When you and I were young, my boy,
      When you and I were young."""
[The whale already],"a golden shovel
The whale already taken got away: the moon alone
—Yosa Buson, translated by Hiroaki Sato
What is endangered, the
rest of us ignore. The whale,
loved by children and cartoonists, already
dwindles. Bycatch has taken
them. The tiny creatures they consume haven’t got
a chance to outlast the warming. A way
to safeguard whales is to deny ourselves the
discs and car exhaust. The moon
sees us at all cost alone."
Blues Fantasy,"Hey! Hey!
That’s what the
Blues singers say.
Singing minor melodies
They laugh,
Hey! Hey!
My man’s done left me,
Chile, he’s gone away.
My good man’s left me,
Babe, he’s gone away.
Now the cryin’ blues
Haunts me night and day.
Hey! . . . Hey!
Weary,
Weary,
Trouble, pain.
Sun’s gonna shine
Somewhere
Again.
I got a railroad ticket,
Pack my trunk and ride.
Sing ’em, sister!
Got a railroad ticket,
Pack my trunk and ride.
And when I get on the train
I’ll cast my blues aside.
Laughing,
Hey! . . . Hey!
Laugh a loud,
Hey! Hey!"
Trees at Night,"Slim Sentinels
Stretching lacy arms
About a slumbrous moon;
Black quivering
Silhouettes,
Tremulous,
Stencilled on the petal
Of a bluebell;
Ink sputtered
On a robin’s breast;
The jagged rent
Of mountains
Reflected in a
Stilly sleeping lake;
Fragile pinnacles
Of fairy castles;
Torn webs of shadows;
And
Printed ’gainst the sky—
The trembling beauty
Of an urgent pine."
Black Dandelion,"Age four— Witnessed my first mow down
Twinkling ground stars, cut by a murderous lawn mower
Feeling the blade, I fell, curled like a snail in grief
  12 full moons folded into Spring — Perennial promises prevailed
Bees celebrated return of dandelions in a skirt of twirling, yellow bliss
Flowering bouffant mirrored my spiky little afro
Jagged edged “lion’s tooth” leaves paid tribute to my snag-a-tooth smile
Me and my freedom fighting flowers frolicked to survive the
scissoring, up-digging, poisoning
Warning Signs hovered like low hanging clouds:
No Blooming Allowed; Blossoms Will be Prosecuted
These brave plants grew just for me
Grew in spite of a society that favored a monochromatic landscape
  1965— Mr. Brother Malcolm X was assassinated, big word for a pre-kindergartner.
I was convinced he must have been a dandelion, Reverend King too,
and the Johnson boy who lived one turn down the street, that way.
The Johnson boy was shot by the police for growing in a monochromatic landscape.
  Training Wheels Off—Bike riding across insecure cement, I peddled the bumpy path
waving solidarity to each surviving, sunburst noggin,
each fulfilling the promise to ornament lawns and flourish souls with lemon drop hope
  Dandelions bare art of
endurance and escape
transforming into pearl puffs
floating with ephemeral intention
carrying the spirit of the weed.
  13 Full moons faded into July — “I am a proud weed!”
  Yes, I declared that shocking proclamation standing in the pulpit on Youth Sunday
Vernon Chapel A.M.E. Church
I added to my speech on David and Goliath
my impromptu improvisation of Dandelion Dogma:
  “We are Black Dandelions who will NEVER be destroyed.
We grow the power of goodness for generations into the future!”
  I yet remember the hat framed faces of the pious, amused and mortified."
Counting the Senses,"To sense the dead around us,  in places where they are attached, or to  sense past lives within the present one.  To sense the presence of birds or animals on the roadside in the dark,  or the moods of birds or animals, let alone people. There are tribes who can orient, even in the fog, naming the direction, east or west, that they are facing. There is the ability to see through lies, to feel an enemy at your back, to detect poison without taste, to dowse for water. You are up before dawn, walking the shore, picking up broken bits of plastic and shell. To sense in ever-refined levels the dissipating cloud-layers of oneself, what Ezra Pound named an “aristocracy of emotion.” In the spruce copse near the confluence, you left your hair. Last night, we played Scrabble. My first word was divine. You added an s to it, doubling your score. In this very room, fourteen years ago, you turned over and found the lump.  Your hand rose to it, as if guided by a sense of love."
Fantasy in Purple,"Beat the drums of tragedy for me.
Beat the drums of tragedy and death.
And let the choir sing a stormy song
To drown the rattle of my dying breath.
Beat the drums of tragedy for me,
And let the white violins whir thin and slow,
But blow one blaring trumpet note of sun
To go with me
                         to the darkness
                                                   where I go."
Joy,"I went to look for Joy,
Slim, dancing Joy,
Gay, laughing Joy,
Bright-eyed Joy,—
And I found her
Driving the butcher's cart
In the arms of the butcher boy!
Such company, such company,
As keeps this young nymph, Joy!"
March Moon,"The moon is naked.
The wind has undressed the moon.
The wind has blown all the cloud-garments
Off the body of the moon
And now she’s naked,
Stark naked.
But why don’t you blush,
O shameless moon?
Don’t you know
It isn’t nice to be naked?"
Poème d’Automne,"The autumn leaves
Are too heavy with color.
The slender trees
On the Vulcan Road
Are dressed in scarlet and gold
Like young courtesans
Waiting for their lovers.
But soon
The winter winds
Will strip their bodies bare
And then
The sharp, sleet-stung
Caresses of cold
Will be their only
Love."
Winter Moon,"How thin and sharp is the moon tonight!
How thin and sharp and ghostly white
Is the slim curved crook of the moon tonight!"
To a Black Dancer in “The Little Savoy”,"Wine-maiden
Of the jazz-tuned night,
Lips
Sweet as purple dew,
Breasts
Like the pillows of all sweet dreams,
Who crushed
The grapes of joy
And dripped their juice
On you?"
Young Prostitute,"Her dark brown face
Is like a withered flower
On a broken stem.
Those kind come cheap in Harlem
So they say."
Nude Young Dancer,"What jungle tree have you slept under,
Midnight dancer of the jazzy hour?
What great forest has hung its perfume
Like a sweet veil about your bower?
What jungle tree have you slept under,
Night-dark girl of the swaying hips?
What star-white moon has been your mother?
To what clean boy have you offered your lips?"
Harlem Night Club,"Sleek black boys in a cabaret.
Jazz-band, jazz-band,—
Play, plAY, PLAY!
Tomorrow. . . . who knows?
Dance today!
White girls’ eyes
Call gay black boys.
Black boys’ lips
Grin jungle joys.
Dark brown girls
In blond men’s arms.
Jazz-band, jazz-band,—
Sing Eve’s charms!
White ones, brown ones,
What do you know
About tomorrow
Where all paths go?
Jazz-boys, jazz-boys,—
Play, plAY, PLAY!
Tomorrow. . . . is darkness.
Joy today!"
"To a Little Lover-Lass, Dead","She
Who searched for lovers
In the night
Has gone the quiet way
Into the still,
Dark land of death
Beyond the rim of day.
Now like a little lonely waif
She walks
An endless street
And gives her kiss to nothingness.
Would God his lips were sweet!"
Revisionary,"The globe on a tilted axis means The News.
As the icon spins the angle seems to shift.
Science has found ancestral Neanderthals.
We have a bit of their blood. They painted caves
Better than sapiens, as we named ourselves.
History has found the Jews who fought for Hitler.
Thousands of Part and what were called Full Jews.
A few were generals.
                                      As the globe revolves
Different mixes keep passing into the light
Or into the dark, and then back out again:
The unexpected, over and over again.
Jefferson’s July 2 draft blamed George III
For violating the liberty of “a People
Who never offended him” shipped off to be
“Slaves in another hemisphere.” For many
“Miserable death in transportation thither.”
On the Fourth of July, that passage was left out. Thither.
In draft after draft of Puddn’head Wilson Twain
Linked and tore apart stories: The conjoined twins
From Italy come to town. In that same town, two
Blue-eyed babies. The nursemaid fair-skinned Roxy
Secretly swops the babies cradle to cradle,
Different nightie to nightie and fate to fate.
The one is her son. He sells her down the river."
Length of Moon,"Then the golden hour
Will tick its last
And the flame will go down in the flower.
A briefer length of moon
Will mark the sea-line and the yellow dune.
Then we may think of this, yet
There will be something forgotten
And something we should forget.
It will be like all things we know: 
A stone will fail; a rose is sure to go.
It will be quiet then and we may stay
Long at the picket gate,—
But there will be less to say."
A Banjo Song,"Oh, dere's lots o' keer an' trouble
    In dis world to swaller down;
An' ol' Sorrer's purty lively
    In her way o' gittin' roun'.
Yet dere's times when I furgit 'em,—
    Aches an' pains an' troubles all,—
An' it's when I tek at ebenin'
    My ol' banjo f'om de wall.
'Bout de time dat night is fallin'
    An' my daily wu'k is done,
An' above de shady hilltops
    I kin see de settin' sun;
When de quiet, restful shadders
    Is beginnin' jes' to fall,—
Den I take de little banjo
    F'om its place upon de wall.
Den my fam'ly gadders roun' me
    In de fadin' o' de light,
Ez I strike de strings to try 'em
    Ef dey all is tuned er-right.
An' it seems we're so nigh heaben
    We kin hyeah de angels sing
When de music o' dat banjo
    Sets my cabin all er-ring.
An' my wife an' all de othahs,—
    Male an' female, small an' big,—
Even up to gray-haired granny,
    Seem jes' boun' to do a jig;
'Twell I change de style o' music,
    Change de movement an' de time,
An' de ringin' little banjo
    Plays an ol' hea't-feelin' hime.
An' somehow my th'oat gits choky,
    An' a lump keeps tryin' to rise
Lak it wan'ed to ketch de water
    Dat was flowin' to my eyes;
An' I feel dat I could sorter
    Knock de socks clean off o' sin
Ez I hyeah my po' ol' granny
    Wif huh tremblin' voice jine in.
Den we all th'ow in our voices
    Fu' to he'p de chune out too,
Lak a big camp-meetin' choiry
    Tryin' to sing a mou'nah th'oo.
An' our th'oahts let out de music,
    Sweet an' solemn, loud an' free,
'Twell de raftahs o' my cabin
    Echo wif de melody.
Oh, de music o' de banjo,
    Quick an' deb'lish, solemn, slow,
Is de greates' joy an' solace
    Dat a weary slave kin know!
So jes' let me hyeah it ringin',
    Dough de chune be po' an' rough,
It's a pleasure; an' de pleasures
    O' dis life is few enough.
Now, de blessed little angels
    Up in heaben, we are told. 
Don't do nothin' all dere lifetime
    'Ceptin' play on ha'ps o' gold.
Now I think heaben'd be mo' homelike
    Ef we'd hyeah some music fall
F'om a real ol'-fashioned banjo,
    Like dat one upon de wall."
Ode for Memorial Day,"Done are the toils and the wearisome marches,
    Done is the summons of bugle and drum.
Softly and sweetly the sky overarches,
    Shelt’ring a land where Rebellion is dumb.
Dark were the days of the country’s derangement,
    Sad were the hours when the conflict was on,
But through the gloom of fraternal estrangement
    God sent his light, and we welcome the dawn.
O’er the expanse of our mighty dominions,
    Sweeping away to the uttermost parts,
Peace, the wide-flying, on untiring pinions,
    Bringeth her message of joy to our hearts.
Ah, but this joy which our minds cannot measure,
    What did it cost for our fathers to gain!
Bought at the price of the heart’s dearest treasure,
    Born out of travail and sorrow and pain;
Born in the battle where fleet Death was flying,
    Slaying with sabre-stroke bloody and fell;
Born where the heroes and martyrs were dying,
    Torn by the fury of bullet and shell.
Ah, but the day is past: silent the rattle,
    And the confusion that followed the fight.
Peace to the heroes who died in the battle,
    Martyrs to truth and the crowning of Right!
Out of the blood of a conflict fraternal,
    Out of the dust and the dimness of death,
Burst into blossoms of glory eternal
    Flowers that sweeten the world with their breath.
Flowers of charity, peace, and devotion
    Bloom in the hearts that are empty of strife;
Love that is boundless and broad as the ocean
    Leaps into beauty and fullness of life.
So, with the singing of paeans and chorals,
    And with the flag flashing high in the sun,
Place on the graves of our heroes the laurels
    Which their unfaltering valor has won!"
There are no kings in America,"we are not that kind of country.
We are sanctuary for the hungry,
the homeless, the huddled,
held together by an idea
our immigrant fathers believed in.
Rendered, it meant independence.
Pursued, it kindled war, ordinance,
a fighting chance. Forty thousand
musket balls, by themselves, did not
shape the boundaries on which we
map our days. To draw our borders,
we needed more than firecakes.
More than a pound of meat
with bone and gristle,
or salt fish and a gill of peas.
We needed the faith and grit of people
who were not yet Americans.
To be an American is to
recognize the sacrifice
of the widow and the orphan;
it is to understand the weft of tent
cities expecting caravans,
and the heft of a child in a camp
not meant for children, or sitting
before a judge awaiting judgement.
What do we say to the native
whose lands we now inhabit?
What do we say to our immigrant
fathers who held certain truths
to be self-evident?
Do we now still pledge to each
other our lives, our fortunes,
our sacred honor.
There are no kings in America.
Only gilded men we can topple
again and again."
Shadowless Shadow,"The Great Matriarch says: There is a dog who barks at his own shadow, which is not there, for in mid-day sun, there is no shadow.
Notice, if I give him a dumpling or a chew-toy, he stops barking, but he does not stop when he sees his shadowless shadow. He barks with warning, with alarm.
He barks louder and louder, snapping his jaws, swallowing sputum, on his haunches, ready to pounce.
He is afraid of what is not there. Like you, Mei Ling, when you wake up, gasping for breath, thinking you might die, that ICE agents will come with a choke-chain.
Poor dear, he wants to protect us from the unseen, the unexpected, the unknowable. This is very bad luck in the neighborhood, to constantly hear the harbinger of doom.
Should we, then, euthanize him, put him out of his misery? To prophesy destruction is to invite bad omens, to stare into the abyss.
Or should we calm him, caress him, give him shelter?
Let’s call him by his birth name and take away his power. Let’s shout, “Hashtag, No Collusion, Gunboat, Death Star, Apocalypse, Mara, Cerberus, Beelzebub!”
Let’s call him, “The one who understands vacuity.”
Let’s not fear him, but love him, offer the pink leash, for he is your dog and he is mine."
I Come From A Place So Deep Inside America It Can't Be Seen,"White oaks thrash, moonlight drifts
the ceiling, as if I'm under water.
Propane coils, warms my bones.
Gone are the magics and songs,
all the things our grandmothers buried—
piles of feathers and angel bones,
inscribed by all who came before.
When I was twelve, my cousins
called me ugly, enough to make it last.
Tonight a celebrity on Oprah
imagines a future where features
can be removed and replaced
on a whim. A moth presses wings
thin as paper against my window,
more beautiful than I could ever be.
Ryegrass raise seedy heads
beyond the bull thistle and preen.
Everything alive aches for more."
What’s Broken,"The slate black sky. The middle step
of the back porch. And long ago
my mother’s necklace, the beads
rolling north and south. Broken
the rose stem, water into drops, glass
knobs on the bedroom door. Last summer’s
pot of parsley and mint, white roots
shooting like streamers through the cracks.
Years ago the cat’s tail, the bird bath,
the car hood’s rusted latch. Broken
little finger on my right hand at birth—
I was pulled out too fast. What hasn’t
been rent, divided, split? Broken
the days into nights, the night sky
into stars, the stars into patterns
I make up as I trace them
with a broken-off blade
of grass. Possible, unthinkable,
the cricket’s tiny back as I lie
on the lawn in the dark, my heart
a blue cup fallen from someone’s hands."
The Jester,"In one hand
I hold tragedy
And in the other
Comedy,—
Masks for the soul.
Laugh with me.
You would laugh!
Weep with me
You would weep!
Tears are my laughter.
Laughter is my pain.
Cry at my grinning mouth,
If you will.
Laugh at my sorrow’s reign.
I am the Black Jester,
The dumb clown of the world,
The booted, booted fool of silly men.
Once I was wise.
Shall I be wise again?"
The South,"The lazy, laughing South
With blood on its mouth.
The sunny-faced South,
     Beast-strong,
     Idiot-brained.
The child-minded South
Scratching in the dead fire’s ashes
For a Negro’s bones.
     Cotton and the moon,
     Warmth, earth, warmth,
     The sky, the sun, the stars,
     The magnolia-scented South.
Beautiful, like a woman,
Seductive as a dark-eyed whore,
     Passionate, cruel,
     Honey-lipped, syphilitic—
     That is the South.
And I, who am black, would love her
But she spits in my face.
And I, who am black,
Would give her many rare gifts
But she turns her back upon me.
     So now I seek the North—
     The cold-faced North,
     For she, they say,
     Is a kinder mistress,
And in her house my children
May escape the spell of the South."
Aunt Sue’s Stories,"Aunt Sue has a head full of stories.
Aunt Sue has a whole heart full of stories.
Summer nights on the front porch
Aunt Sue cuddles a brown-faced child to her bosom
And tells him stories.
Black slaves
Working in the hot sun,
And black slaves
Walking in the dewy night,
And black slaves
Singing sorrow songs on the banks of a mighty river
Mingle themselves softly
In the flow of old Aunt Sue's voice,
Mingle themselves softly
In the dark shadows that cross and recross
Aunt Sue's stories.
And the dark-faced child, listening,
Knows that Aunt Sue's stories are real stories.
He knows that Aunt Sue
Never got her stories out of any book at all,
But that they came
Right out of her own life.
And the dark-faced child is quiet
Of a summer night
Listening to Aunt Sue’s stories."
Poem,"The night is beautiful,
So the faces of my people.
The stars are beautiful,
So the eyes of my people.
Beautiful, also, is the sun.
Beautiful, also, are the souls of my people."
"Wake Up, Mario","For Mario Gonzalez Arenales (1994-2021)
He’s not doing anything wrong. He’s just scaring my wife.
—call to the Alameda Police Department, April 19, 2021
They watched him from the window of the house, a man at the fence
in a crooked wool cap, chipping at their tree with a comb, liquor bottles
in a shopping basket by his feet. They heard him speak to the wife’s
mother in the yard, tongue thick in his mouth, heavy with lamentation.
He could be the Aztec god of pestilence, no mask, breathing the plague
on them through walls and doors. The Mexican nanny might be able  
to read the hieroglyphics tumbling from his mouth, but she was wheeling 
a stroller through the streets of Alameda, the trees bowing deeply.
On the news, the body-cam clip wobbles like the video at a barbecue.
The cops are cheerful as they encircle him in the park across the street.
He says his name is Mario. One cop scolds this refugee from Oakland about
drinking in our parks, wants ID so they can be on our merry way. Mario says:
Merry-go-round? He steps up on a tree stump as if to ride it. The cops climb off
the spinning horses of Mario’s imagination, tugging at his arms as he peeks
at them under the cap. Now they are cowboys at the rodeo, but Mario is not
a steer, crashing to the applause of hands that would carve him into steaks.
The cops shove him to the ground, facedown. Mario squirms and bucks;
he is the prize at the county fair, a beast who tries to calm his captors,
so he spits all the words he knows to make them stop: oh God, please,
thank you, and sorry, I’m sorry, I’m so sorry. I forgive you, says one cop,
as the other cop digs his knee into Mario’s back, where it stays even after
they cuff him, even after the first cop says: Think we can roll him on his side?
He asks Mario for his birthday, as if there will be a barbecue in the backyard
at the cop’s house, and Mario, facedown in the wood chips and the dirt,
with the other cop’s knee pressing into his back, wheezes the word: 1994.
There were cries, then silence. There were no last words. In medieval days,
the prisoner at the block would forgive the headsman and drop a coin into
his hand for a clean strike of the blade. In Salem’s Puritan days, a man accused
of witchcraft, after two days of stones stacked on him, sneered: More weight.
There were no last words from Mario when they rolled him over at last.
The last words were in the headlines that same day, jury deliberations
two thousand miles away in Minneapolis, the case of a cop kneeling
on the neck of a Black man, facedown and handcuffed, for nine minutes.
In Alameda, the cops began CPR and their incantation over the asphyxiated body: 
Wake up, Mario, wake up, as if he would be late for school on class picture day, 
as if he would miss his shift at the pizzeria where the paychecks dwindled away, 
as if he had an autistic brother waiting at home for Mario to help him step from 
the shower, button his shirt, comb his hair. His autistic brother still waits for Mario.
The man who called the cops, his wife’s hand gripping his shoulder,
says We greatly regret what happened and never intended, says Terrible
things are being said about us, says Our autistic child is able to read
and is terribly sensitive. The sign in front of the dark house says: For Sale.
The merry-go-round in Mario’s imagination grinds on, creaking
day after day: the caller who presses the button to make the horses go,
the cops charging like cavalry after the renegade, the dead man galloping
ahead, escape impossible, his horse impaled on a pole, kicking the air.
The Mexican nanny called Crucita blames herself for rolling the stroller back
too late. She visits the altar for Mario across the street from the tree missing
a sliver of bark from his comb. The roses wreathing his face shrivel to plastic,
balloons gone flat, votive candles cold. There is an autopsy after the autopsy.
The coroner keeps the city’s secrets, a priest hiding in the confessional.
In her sleep, Crucita sees Mario, sometimes a body splayed across the street,
breath squeezed from his lungs like the last note from the pipes of a calliope,
sometimes breaking free, the painted horse lunging away, as he rides
along the coast to the deserts of Baja California, down mountain trails
off the maps of Yanqui generals and their armies, deep into the songs about
bandidos too clever to be caught, revolutionaries the bullets cannot kill."
Last Mattress,"This $1,600 slice of foam,
if it stays firm, will be the last mattress
I’ll ever buy. It’s comfortable enough
for years of sleeps, for the long, thwarted hours
of scribbling sentences, or to step from
into the surrey with the fringe on top.
Given the choice between flat-lining here,
and 1,000,000 other possibilities
for the time when my pronouns and now end—
I’d pick my bed, and passing on with good dreams.
One jot, on this little blue and green globe
where life evolved, and consciousness, and hope."
"On “Phantasmagorique #15,” a Painting by Kathy Goodell","An initial, fine-grained impulse is to claim an anagoge,
The pure image not enough in its ochres and rouge
For us who, like Ariadne, long to weave its spackled ore
Within our sight without retreat to the ovoid view of Mars
We would recall from the probe’s first aching photos
Showing us as much of absence as any articulation
Of what an alien language might say with its discolorations
Along the risen seafloor face of a mountain, barren of blessing,
Garneted with Pompeian lavas and eddyings
Predicted to evanesce under our mesmeric gaze.
We retreat from witness of its charnal blooms,
Our own premonitions of decay, but the eternal itself,
Balanced on its white stool, elephantine oval,
Baroque bruisings of loss, dorsal of earth,
Clawing nail of Cimabue trapped within
The splintered, shit-colored rot of the Cross
No one regrets having disavowed,
Still rises in our guileless dreaming,
Pure blood from our yellow bones,
A quail’s pure egg speckled in splashes of sleep."
Joy,"Joy shakes me like the wind that lifts a sail,
Like the roistering wind
That laughs through stalwart pines.
It floods me like the sun
On rain-drenched trees
That flash with silver and green.
I abandon myself to joy—
I laugh—I sing.
Too long have I walked a desolate way,
Too long stumbled down a maze
Bewildered."
The White Ones,"I do not hate you,
For your faces are beautiful, too.
I do not hate you,
Your faces are whirling lights of loveliness and splendor, too.
Yet why do you torture me,
O, white strong ones,
Why do you torture me?"
Disillusion,"I would be simple again,
Simple and clean
Like the earth,
Like the rain,
Nor ever know,
Dark Harlem,
The wild laughter
Of your mirth
Nor the salt tears
Of your pain.
Be kind to me,
Oh, great dark city.
Let me forget.
I will not come
To you again."
Summer Night,"The sounds
Of the Harlem night
Drop one by one into stillness.
The last player-piano is closed. 
The last victrola ceases with the
“Jazz Boy Blues.”
The last crying baby sleeps
And the night becomes
Still as a whispering heartbeat.
I toss
Without rest in the darkness,
Weary as the tired night,
My soul
Empty as the silence,
Empty with a vague,
Aching emptiness,
Desiring,
Needing someone,
Something.
I toss without rest
In the darkness
Until the new dawn,
Wan and pale,
Descends like a white mist
Into the court-yard.
 "
Afraid,"We cry among the skyscrapers
As our ancestors
Cried among the palms in Africa
Because we are alone,
It is night,
And we’re afraid. "
Lament for Dark Peoples,"I was a red man one time,
But the white men came.
I was a black man, too,
But the white men came.
They drove me out of the forest.
They took me away from the jungles.
I lost my trees.
I lost my silver moons.
Now they’ve caged me
In the circus of civilization.
Now I herd with the many—
Caged in the circus of civilization. 
 "
Death of an Old Seaman,"We buried him high on a windy hill,
But his soul went out to sea.
I know, for I heard, when all was still,
His sea-soul say to me:
Put no tombstone at my head,
For here I do not make my bed.
Strew no flowers on my grave,
I’ve gone back to the wind and wave.
Do not, do not weep for me,
For I am happy with my sea."
Sea Charm,"Sea charm
The sea’s own children
Do not understand.
They know
But that the sea is strong
Like God’s hand.
They know
But that sea wind is sweet
Like God’s breath,
And that the sea holds
A wide, deep death."
Natcha,"Natcha, offering love.
For ten shillings offering love.
Offering: A night with me, honey.
A long, sweet night with me.
   Come, drink palm wine.
   Come, drink kisses.
A long, dream night with me."
Seascape,"Off the coast of Ireland
    As our ship passed by
We saw a line of fishing ships
    Etched against the sky.
Off the coast of England
    As we rode the foam
We saw an Indian merchantman
    Coming home."
Young Sailor,"He carries
His own strength
And his own laughter,
His own today
And his own hereafter,––
This strong young sailor
Of the wide seas.
What is money for?
To spend, he says.
And wine?
To drink.
And women?
To love.
And today?
For joy.
And tomorrow?
For joy.
And the green sea
For strength,
And the brown land
For laughter.
And nothing hereafter."
Caribbean Sunset,"God having a hemorrhage,
Blood coughed across the sky,
Staining the dark sea red,
That is sunset in the Caribbean."
8.,"snow-covered earth
such silence
still divine presence
echoes immortal migrants
all life sustained
darkness comes
suffering touches us
again and again
there is pain
there in the midst of
such harsh barrenness
a cardinal framed in the glass
red light
calling away despair
eternal promise
everything changes and ends"
Sea Calm,"How still,
How strangely still
The water is today.
It is not good
For water
To be so still that way."
Port Town,"Hello, sailor boy,
In from the sea!
Hello, sailor,
Come with me!
Come on drink cognac.
Rather have wine?
Come here, I love you.
Come and be mine.
Lights, sailor boy,
Warm, white lights.
Solid land, kid.
Wild, white nights.
Come on, sailor,
Out o’ the sea.
Let’s go, sweetie!
Come with me."
Long Trip,"The sea is a wilderness of waves,
A desert of water.
We dip and dive,
Rise and roll,
Hide and are hidden
On the sea.
   Day, night,
   Night, day,
The sea is a desert of waves,
A wilderness of water."
4.,"earth works
thick brown mud
clinging pulling
a body down
hear wounded earth cry
bequeath to me
the hoe the hope
ancestral rights
to turn the ground over
to shovel and sift
until history
rewritten resurrected
returns to its rightful owners
a past to claim
yet another stone lifted to
throw against the enemy
making way for new endings
random seeds
spreading over the hillside
wild roses
come by fierce wind and hard rain
unleashed furies
here in this untouched wood
a dirge a lamentation
for earth to live again
earth that is all at once a grave
a resting place a bed of new beginnings
avalanche of splendor
 "
A Farewell,"With gypsies and sailors,
Wanderers of the hills and seas,
I go to seek my fortune.
With pious folk and fair
I must have a parting.
But you will not miss me,––
You who live between the hills
And have never seen the seas."
Water Front Streets,"The spring is not so beautiful there,––
   But dream ships sail away
To where the spring is wondrous rare
   And life is gay.
The spring is not so beautiful there,––
   But lads put out to sea
Who carry beauties in their hearts
   And dreams, like me."
What Comes,"J’ai rapporté du désespoir un panier si petit mon amour, qu’on a pu le tresser en osier.
I brought from despair a basket so small, my love, that it might have been woven of willow.
                                                                                       —Rene Char
  to speak is not yet to have spoken.
the not-yet of a white realm of nothing left
neither for itself nor another
a no-longer already there, along with the arrival of what has been 
light and the reverse of light
terror as walking blind along the breaking sea, body in whom I lived
the not-yet of death darkening what it briefly illuminates
an unknown place as between languages
back and forth, breath to breath as a calm
in the surround rises, fireflies in lindens, an ache of pine
you have yourself within you
yourself, you have her, and there is nothing
that cannot be seen
open then to the coming of what comes"
Toward the End,"In this archipelago of thought a fog descends, horns of ships to unseen ships, a year
passing overhead, the cry of a year not knowing where, someone in the aftermath
 who once you knew, the one you were, a little frisson of recognition,
then just like that—gone, and no one for hours, a sound you thought you heard
 but in waking darkness is not heard again, two sharp knocks on the door, death
it was you said but now nothing, islands, places you have been, the sea the uncertain,
 ghosts calling out, lost as they are, no one you knew in life, a moon above
the whole of it, like the light at the bottom of a well opening in the iced air
 where you have gone under and come back light, no longer tethered
to your own past, and were it not for the weather of trance, of haze and murk, you could
 see everything at once: every moment you have lived or place you have been, without
confusion or bafflement, and you would be one person. You would be one person again."
In Time of War,"And so we stayed, night after night awake
until the moon fell behind the blackened cypress,
and bats returned to their caverns having gorged
on the night air, and all remained still until the hour
of rising, when the headless woman was no longer seen
nor a ghostly drum heard, nor anyone taking
the form of mist or a fiddler, and the box never opened
by itself, nor were there whispers or other sounds, no rustling
dress or pet ape trapped in a secret passage, but there was
labored breathing, and unseen hands leafing through
the pages of a visitor’s book, and above the ruins a girl
in white lace, and five or more candles floating,
and someone did see a white dog bound into a nearby
wood, but there were neither bagpipes nor smiling skull,
no skeletons piled in the oubliette, and there was,
as it turned out, no yellow monkey, no blood
leaking from a slit throat, and no one saw
a woman carrying the severed head,
but there were children standing on their own
graves and there was the distant rumble of cannon."
Morning On This Island,"The lights across the water are the waking city.
The water shimmers with imaginary fish.
Not far from here lie the bones of conifers
washed from the sea and piled by wind.
Some mornings I walk upon them,
bone to bone, as far as the lighthouse.
A strange beetle has eaten most of the trees. 
It may have come here on the ships playing
music in the harbor, or it was always here, a winged
jewel, but in the past was kept still by the cold
of a winter that no longer comes.
There is an owl living in the firs behind us, but he is white,
meant to be mistaken for snow burdening a bough. 
They say he is the only owl remaining. I hear him at night
listening for the last of the mice and asking who of no other owl."
As I Grew Older,"It was a long time ago.
I have almost forgotten my dream.
But it was there then,
In front of me,
Bright like a sun,—
My dream.
And then the wall rose,
Rose slowly,
Slowly,
Between me and my dream.
Rose slowly, slowly,
Dimming,
Hiding,
The light of my dream.
Rose until it touched the sky,—
The wall.
Shadow.
I am black.
I lie down in the shadow.
No longer the light of my dream before me,
Above me.
Only the thick wall.
Only the shadow.
My hands!
My dark hands!
Break through the wall!
Find my dream!
Help me to shatter this darkness,
To smash this night,
To break this shadow
Into a thousand lights of sun,
Into a thousand whirling dreams
Of sun!"
"To the Dark Mercedes of ""El Palacio De Amor""","Mercedes is a jungle-lily in a death house. 
Mercedes is a doomed star. 
Mercedes is a charnel rose. 
Go where gold 
Will fall at the feet of your beauty,
Mercedes. 
Go where they will pay you well 
For your loveliness. "
Young Bride,"They say she died,—
Although I do not know, 
They say she died of grief 
And in the earth-dark of Death 
Sought calm relief, 
And rest from pain of love
In loveless sleep. "

You dreamers. 
Bring me all of your 
Heart melodies
That I may wrap them 
In a blue cloud-cloth

Premonition,"        Dear heart, good-night!
Nay, list awhile that sweet voice singing
    When the world is all so bright,
And the sound of song sets the heart a-ringing,
    Oh, love, it is not right—
    Not then to say, ""Good-night.""
        Dear heart, good-night!
The late winds in the lake weeds shiver,
    And the spray flies cold and white.
And the voice that sings gives a telltale quiver—
    ""Ah, yes, the world is bright,
     But, dearest heart, good-night!""
        Dear heart, good-night!
And do not longer seek to hold me!
    For my soul is in affright
As the fearful glooms in their pall enfold me.
    See him who sang how white
    And still; so, dear, good-night.
        Dear heart, good-night!
Thy hand I'll press no more forever,
    And mine eyes shall lose the light;
For the great white wraith by the winding river
    Shall check my steps with might.
    So, dear, good-night, good-night!"
The Lawyers' Ways,"I've been list'nin' to them lawyers
    In the court house up the street,
An' I've come to the conclusion
    That I'm most completely beat.
Fust one feller riz to argy,
    An' he boldly waded in
As he dressed the tremblin' pris'ner
    In a coat o' deep-dyed sin.
Why, he painted him all over
    In a hue o' blackest crime,
An' he smeared his reputation
    With the thickest kind o' grime,
Tell I found myself a-wond'rin',
    In a misty way and dim,
How the Lord had come to fashion
    Sich an awful man as him.
Then the other lawyer started,
    An' with brimmin', tearful eyes,
Said his client was a martyr
    That was brought to sacrifice.
An' he give to that same pris'ner
    Every blessed human grace,
Tell I saw the light o' virtue
    Fairly shinin' from his face.
Then I own 'at I was puzzled
    How sich things could rightly be;
An' this aggervatin' question
    Seems to keep a-puzzlin' me.
So, will some one please inform me,
    An' this mystery unroll–
How an angel an' a devil
    Can persess the self-same soul?"
Two Songs,"A bee that was searching for sweets one day
Through the gate of a rose garden happened to stray.
In the heart of a rose he hid away,
And forgot in his bliss the light of day,
As sipping his honey he buzzed in song;
Though day was waning, he lingered long,
For the rose was sweet, so sweet.
A robin sits pluming his ruddy breast,
And a madrigal sings to his love in her nest:
""Oh, the skies they are blue, the fields are green,
And the birds in your nest will soon be seen!""
She hangs on his words with a thrill of love,
And chirps to him as he sits above,
For the song is sweet, so sweet.
A maiden was out on a summer's day
With the winds and the waves and the flowers at play;
And she met with a youth of gentle air,
With the light of the sunshine on his hair.
Together they wandered the flowers among;
They loved, and loving they lingered long,
For to love is sweet, so sweet.

                        ————
Bird of my lady's bower,
Sing her a song;
Tell her that every hour,
All the day long,
Thoughts of her come to me,
Filling my brain
With the warm ecstasy
Of love's refrain.
Little bird! happy bird!
Being so near,
Where e'en her slightest word
Thou mayest hear,
Seeing her glancing eyes,
Sheen of her hair,
Thou art in paradise,—
Would I were there.
I am so far away,
Thou art so near;
Plead with her, birdling gay,
Plead with my dear.
Rich be thy recompense,
     Fine be thy fee,
If through thine eloquence
     She hearken me."
Ode to Tired Bumblebees Who Fall Asleep Inside Flowers with Pollen on their Butts,"Usually, it’s the males. Maybe
they’ve gone out with buddies
in their leks, keeping their radar
tuned for female bees as they move
from sweet pea to mallow flower and
snapdragon, gathering pollen
in those hairy saddlebags called
corbiculae. Maybe they have
no place to return or are lost,
having gone too far from the nest.
Maybe the empty football fields
and elementary school playgrounds,
long unmowed since our common
isolation and teeming now
with yellow dandelions, proved
too much. Sweet alyssum,
phlox; wisteria cascading heavy
out of themselves. Honeysuckle
and evening-scented stock,
dianthus crowned with hint
of cinnamon and smoky clove.
Female bees will also burrow
deep inside the shade of a squash
flower: the closer to the source
of nectar, the warmer and more
quilt-like the air. In the cool
hours of morning, look closely
for the slight but tell-tale
trembling in each flower cup:
there, a body dropped mid-flight,
mid-thought. How we all retreat
behind some folded screen as work
or the world presses in too
soon, too close, too much."
The Conversation,"All the while he talks to
the boy, their son, on the phone,
she is interrupting, telling him something
to say, not to say, indicating
that she needs to talk to the boy
herself. Rather than dampening
her enthusiasm or trying
to listen to both at once, finally
he hands her the phone. And rather
than resentment, what he feels
inside himself is the primordial
upwelling of tenderness."
Give Yourself Some Flowers,"And in the beginning,
God gave your body
a checklist:
Keep your heart
on beat
and your lungs
dancing with oxygen,
not passive to air.
Make sure
the path of your blood
slows down
for checkpoints
and avoids
bumps
in the road.
Train your nerves
to keep a balanced pace
and stay within
the lines
of steady flow.
Push forward
without putting
too much
pressure
on movement.
Remember
to return to water
when your spirit
and its frame
are in drought.
Treat your body
like a well-rounded planet
built for all seasons,
or pretend you are
an adaptable star:
Float in the black
and stay there
if you need to,
save some light
for yourself.
In other words,
rest like the sun does:
Schedule some time
to stay out of sight
when too many people
praise warm energy.
Keep in mind
all of these things
when depression
tells you
nothing is working.
Keep in mind
all of these things
when it tells you
there is no
invisible force
connecting us,
when your veins
are stopped by blood clots,
when your bones are dry,
and the water
is too quick to boil.
Keep in mind
all of these things
when it tells you
that the soul is like the body:
Made to be broken,
open to deterioration
and doubt. Yes,
keep in mind
all of these things
and remember:
Even when it
seems like
the clock isn’t ticking,
you were made perfectly
for this moment
in time."
Eye on the Sparrow,"I woke to rapid flapping, the air cold
the time unknown. The dog’s paws tapping
on chill hardwood floor. Sudden
commotion. Jumping to corral what was
assumed to be an animal fight, I find
a California Towhee in my dining room.
Frantic, frightened. Brisk movement in her
wings making the room that much more frigid.
I stammer to her. Follow her room to room
as she attempts to fly her way out of walls
until she finally calms, allowing me to cup her
into my hands. We sit together outside
on a frosty concrete step. My bare feet
settling on top of wet fall leaves, gathering
the taste of morning in my mouth, the scent
of rain and dirt. She catches her breath.
My thumb softly wrapped around her chest
feeling her heart rate regulating, her eyes opening,
her fear receding. Leaves rustle, wind and traffic
move along while she and I watch each other
in a place where time moves slower than the rest
of the world. Her eyelids the color of peach
and terracotta. Her body the rusty hue of autumn.
Her eyes the same shade as mine, dark as loam.
I flatten my hand. She doesn’t move. We sit
together for what seems like hours. What seems
like fate when safety is reciprocated. Ten minutes
later she flies, stops on a dog-eared picket
and looks back. The dog quietly watches me.
How I love and let go all at once."
Poem Ending and Beginning on Lines by Larry Levis,"Because you haven’t praised anything in months,
and because iron, because two ten pound plates—
when pressed to six wheels and late sets—are enough
to drive better men to dust, and because the young bucks 
curling near the mirror have paused their pretty work 
to watch your old ass snatch from the bench’s 
buckling uprights all three hundred and thirty five 
goddam pounds, you summon the saint of iron, 
the blacksmith in palm skirt fisting his machetes,
to give you just a little bit of what you need to bring it
down, to bang it up, just once. Just this once.
—Ago, Baba Mi. Ogun Owanile O, Ogun, Cobu Cobu.
Of course, the young bucks chuckle at this ooga-booga 
babble, this strange ritual gibberish of an old-timer, 
obviously—in the parlance of the place—dead set 
to fuck his self up. But you break the weight, you do.  
And the room falls quiet but for the quiver and clang 
of iron on iron, the few slim seconds it takes to turn 
back time. Lift off, and you’re a young man in an old city.  
No beard, no gray. Lift again, and Parliament is pulsing 
from a ghetto blaster perched on a pair of milk crates 
in a neighbor’s yellow yard, your sixteen-year-old self 
is writhing under another bar, what feels like two tons 
crushing you dead, and Robert Caldwell’s glaring 
from behind the bench, yelling for you to drive it all up.
Robert Caldwell, barrel chested, chiseled, and damn
near three hundred pounds, who pushed a pallet jack 
for twelve hour shifts, after twenty-something years 
stretched across San Quentin, Soledad, and Folsom; 
Robert Caldwell, the triple O.G., who once threatened 
his boss with a box-cutter for wolfing loud, or holding 
eye contact a little too long, has for reasons unknown
chosen you for his pet project, promising to forge you
into something unbreakable. Said by summer’s end, 
you, too, will have grown men flinching when you flex, 
and the women—oh, the women—will make disappear 
all the deep deep ache a man inflicts on himself.  Or, 
rather, all the pain Robert Caldwell will inflict on you.  
For make no mistake, this will be a summer that hurts.  
Deadlifts, box squats, power cleans, and curls.  
The egg yolks’ nasty, the slither down your throat.  
Drop sets, pyramids, twenty-ones, and cheats. The day
you learned how Robert Caldwell found his father
dead. Days dead the day before, a stolen Desert Eagle
spent and sprawled near what once was a face.
Robert Caldwell drops this on you hard between sets,
but doesn’t pause to break down sobbing. Push, nigga.  
Push, says Robert Caldwell. Pain is weakness leaving.  
Push, nigga. Push. Become something unbreakable. 
Robert Caldwell doesn’t break or take a day to mourn, 
or ring your phone late night to chat about regret, 
or counsel you to love better than you’ve been.  
He does what any good ironworker does. He works.  
And he works you. All summer long. Sets and reps 
and pressure and flame and all the requisite ache.
You don’t break, exactly, but come close to buckling.
That summer, and summers since. So much burn,
so much weight. So much. You’ll leave three women, 
the rest will leave you first.  You’ll bury your own father, 
lose four friends to gunfire, one to a jailhouse noose.
Your hands will shame you often. But first, this.  
O.G. Robert Caldwell, his jigs, blocks, and hammer.
O.G. Robert Caldwell, backlit by the sun. Ogun
Owanile O, Ogun Cobu Cobu. How beautiful this man,
his trust in iron, what it gives us, what it takes.
What it gives again. He yells for you to push, you push.
Robert Caldwell, you think, would have loved this 
beat down Brooklyn hole in the wall, its ripped leather
seatbacks, all its stale air. He’d have loved the rusty 
dumbbells, the dirt caked mirror, the young bucks 
circling you now, watching and waiting. You stare hard 
into that mirror, into your beard and gray. Crow’s feet 
and furrows. Thirty-something summers and you’ve become 
the triple O.G. Every ache you’ve earned tells you so.
The young bucks clock you as you lay back on the bench,
your hands chalked and finding their grip. Weight,
you think, they don’t have a clue. You break the bar
from its rack, feel it all bearing down. The quiver and heft,
the sudden, overcast quiet of the past tense.
 "
"Dolores, Maybe","I’ve never spoken to anyone about this.  Until now, until you.
I slept once in a field beyond the riverbank,
a flock of nightjars watching over me.
That was the summer a farmer found his daughter
hanging in the hayloft, and wished, for the first time,
he had not touched her so.
I wish I could say we were close—the girl and I,
I mean—but I only knew her to wave hello,
and walked her, once, halfway up the road
before turning finally into my grandmother’s yard.
This was Ontario, California. 1983.
Which is to say, there was no river.
And I wouldn’t know a nightjar if it bit me.
But the girl was real. And the day they found her, that was real.
And the dress she wore, same as on our walk—
periwinkle, she called it; I called it blue,
blue with bright yellow flowers all over
—the dress and the flowers, they too were real.
And on our walk, I remember, we cut through the rail yard, 
and came upon a dead coyote lying near the tracks.
A frail and dusty heap of regret, he was companion to no one.
We stared at him for some time, our shadows stretched long and covering the animal.
She said something I’d remember for years, about loneliness,
but have long forgotten, the way I’ve forgotten—
though I can see her face as if she were standing right here—her very name.
Let’s call her Dolores, from dolor. Spanish for anguish.
And whatever the sky, however lovely that afternoon, 
I remember mostly the wind, 
how a breeze unraveled what was left of a braid, 
and when I tried to brush from Dolores’s brow 
a few loose strands, how she flinched,
how she ran the rest of the way home,
how I never saw her after that,
except when they carried her from the barn—her periwinkle dress,
her blue legs and arms, and the fields 
ablaze with daisies.
I spent the rest of that summer in the rail yard 
with my dead coyote, watching trains loaded and leaving.
All summer long, I’d pelt him with stones.
All summer long, I’d use the stones to spell the girl’s name—
Dolores, maybe—in the dirt.
All summer long, fire ants crawled over and between each letter—
her name, now, its own small town.
A season of heat and heavy rains washed my coyote to nothing.  
Only teeth and a few stubborn bones 
that refused, finally, to go down.
Weeks into autumn, someone found the father
hanged from the same groaning tie-beams,
the hayloft black with bottle flies.
But that was 1983. Ontario, California.  
Which is to say, the bottle flies are dead. So, too, the ants.  
And neither field nor barn is where I left it.
I’ve never spoken to anyone about this. Until now, until you.
I gathered a handful of my coyote’s bones, his teeth,
and strung them all on fishing wire—
a talisman to ward off anguish. A talisman I hold out to you now.
Please. Come closer. Take this from my hand.
   "
On Metaphor,"In back of daddy’s closet, 
behind the cold and loaded 
pistol, I find a cedar box 
of snapshots—his company 
in camouflage, waving rifles,
reefer, and middle fingers 
at the photographer. At you.  
And at me. And here, 
the full-lipped redbone
he left in the world without
a goodbye. Here, a strange
boy with my father’s forehead,
same sullen eyes. Flip the photo: 
a stranger’s name and dates 
that don’t add, scrawled as if
rushed, as if a fugitive’s note
slipped quick to the future.
When my mother walks in,
I shove the box to the back
of the shelf, say nothing
of the redbone or the boy.
I hand her, instead, the pistol.
A .45, I believe. Its cold barrel
swelling in the room’s bum
light. When she angles it,
just so, I think I see my father
reflected in the steel. Wait, no—
Not my father. It’s me.
 "
Variation on a Theme by Elizabeth Bishop,"Start with loss. Lose everything. Then lose it all again.  
Lose a good woman on a bad day. Find a better woman, 
then lose five friends chasing her. Learn to lose as if 
your life depended on it. Learn that your life depends on it.
Learn it like karate, like riding a bike. Learn it, master it.
Lose money, lose time, lose your natural mind.
Get left behind, then learn to leave others. Lose and
lose again. Measure a father’s coffin against a cousin’s 
crashing T-cells. Kiss your sister through prison glass.  
Know why your woman’s not answering her phone.
Lose sleep. Lose religion. Lose your wallet in El Segundo.  
Open your window. Listen: the last slow notes
of a Donny Hathaway song. A child crying. Listen:  
A drunk man is cussing out the moon. He sounds like 
your dead uncle, who, before he left, lost a leg 
to sugar. Shame. Learn what’s given can be taken; 
what can be taken, will. This you can bet on without 
losing. Sure as nightfall and an empty bed. Lose
and lose again. Lose until it’s second nature. Losing
farther, losing faster. Lean out your open window, listen:
The child is laughing now. No, it’s the drunk man again
in the street, losing his voice, suffering each invisible star.

Troubled Woman,"She stands
In the quiet darkness,
This troubled woman,
Bowed by
Weariness and pain, 
Like an
Autumn flower
In the frozen rain. 
Like a 
Wind-blown autumn flower
That never lifts its head 
Again. "
Suicide’s Note,"The calm, 
Cool face of the river
Asked me for a kiss. "
Sick Room,"How quiet 
It is in this sick room 
Where on the bed 
A silent woman lies between two lovers—
Life and Death, 
And all three covered with a sheet of pain. "
Soledad,"A Cuban Portrait 
The shadows 
Of too many nights of love 
Have fallen beneath your eyes. 
Your eyes, 
So full of pain and passion,
So full of lies. 
So full of pain and passion, 
Soledad, 
So deeply scarred, 
So still with silent cries. "
Nailing Things Down,"may also kill them,
           but she had no great plans
                      to live happily ever after.
Today is all she could manage,
           that & the breathless sounds of Pres,
                      tamping down the day’s anarchy.
Twenty years earlier, her voice left her,
           so she quit smoking. When it returned
                      it was vibrating like a dusty contralto.
Today she smells facts:
           the air thick with tomorrow’s rain,
                      a slow leak in the basement.
The five shots of Jameson on his breath.
           His undershirt brushed with
                      someone else’s perfume, a scent
                                 she’d worn in high school—Shalimar.
Twenty years ago, on a dime,
           she’d have cut or shot him to clear
                      the air, but today is not that day.
Today she looks at her body 
           with some hesitation. It’s late
                      in the morning & the gravy’s
                                                gonna run thin tonight.
Will she miss the wanting, the having or the gone?"
Three Wrong Notes,"Note the diameter of your invisible ink tattoo as if it hides
a crossword hint like “Clueless dope for dopamine”
But not because your inner twin sold all your Rap albums
for a white powder that made you feel touched by God, yet
left a trail like Comet. Note how a certain name trails off with
the number e to perhaps signify their constant interest in
a continuously growing silence. Does an infinite series
of silences imply addition or addiction? In one language
you understand, pegadu means touching and begins with
the letter P. Like Pi is filled with touches of fruitful irrationality,
and may hide a circle’s Private Key. Note how rumors of you
crossing the street to sneak rides on fire trucks are irrational, but
not because you’re vain or became a pyromaniac. The circumference
of urinal cakes may be solved with Pi or dissolved with pee.
Is it irrational that you looped like an extension cord while trying
to solve for the value of P, but got beat like a bowl of egg yolks
for wetting the bed? During the beating was their mouth agápē or
agape? Has it not been proven that trauma only feels transcendental
due to the ratio of the diameter which severs us to the circumference
which makes us a whole? Being born under the Sign of the Asp might
be key, but note that a Volta can turn in currents of a Ghanaian river
or in currents alternating like a weathervane until any cryptic tattoo
could simply signify who held you down and touched you, but also
told you to hold it forever because their love was like the Holy Ghost."
Not Once,"Not once—not when I toppled, rigid, a
5'7"" pine felled,
stiff as a board, a five and a half foot
plank, 16 x 32,
and not while I wallowed on the rug among
his oxygen tubes and my cane and his 8
wheelchair wheels, and not when I sat by his
hospice bed, chirping I’m fine!,
and not the next day, when the brilliant violet
and black slash-slathered in my easy-life skin,
or days later when the purple turned yellow and the
blue green—never once when I
said No pain, Nothing broken,
did I feel lucky, did I measure the force of the
blow, the floor speeding up like a heavy-weight’s
smash to my cheek and eyebrow, not until
today, did I begin to feel
grateful for my good fortune—no concussion, no
fracture—as if I expected to be able to be
struck by the earth, a wrecking ball,
and not feel it—
as when someone on the other side of the world,
or the city, is struck in my name, I do not feel it."

                                                  leads to another
rainbow, a choker of hippie beads,
                                                                & I can’t
stop hearing Dad’s voice
                                             almost going there
on “Nature Boy,” no struggle
                                                      trying to hide
behind his eyes. He almost made it,
                                                                 but didn’t
know how to leave dirt on the roots.
                                                                  Maybe this
is why I must keep hurt alive,
                                                       limping inside
some bamboo cage.

Lately, I feel how worlds shift.
                                                          I don’t know
how they slip the yoke,
                                               but three nights ago
these sappers broke through
                                                     concertina wire,
their naked bodies greased,
                                                  as they ran & slung
wild satchel charges.
                                   I was tied up in a hut
of clay & thatch, & a nameless
                                                       army nurse
sat in a corner, sizing me up,
                                                    camouflaged
in blackface, & she wore
                                            next to nothing.
I heard a tap on the other side
                                                        of the wall,
sounding a message in code,
                                                    & the nurse Lt.
stood up, & said, that’s John.

What’s going on here,
                                               huh? I mean, look,
 the Navy pilot never played
                                                   blind czar of Id
ransacking the rosebushes
                                                  on a false trail,
& we need him at our backs.
                                                         What hellhole
do heel spurs rise from? 
                                            Pardon my brogue.
All summer the devil
                                    was sharping his blade
on cold black whetstone,
                                             & now this hard rain
falling inside, turning life
                                              into gray moss,
but I still love my jackfruit.

Sometimes I hear Roberta
                                                saying, Lawd,
come here, Boy,
                            & let us talk glory days.
We sit there, ruminating,
                                              wondering why
police would shoot
                                  unarmed Black folks,
gazing at our faces
                                   in the water, as the cork
bobs, & nylon line tightens,
                                                  my bone hook
in the throat of a gold-belly
                                                  perch big as two
hands, & I feel the river
                                           growing angry,
ready to leap the bank,
                                           ready to rampage
one hundred years in one
                                                   night, red
dusk to dawn’s new season."
Barbara Frietchie,"Up from the meadows rich with corn,
Clear in the cool September morn,
The clustered spires of Frederick stand
Green-walled by the hills of Maryland.
Round about them orchards sweep,
Apple- and peach-tree fruited deep,
Fair as a garden of the Lord
To the eyes of the famished rebel horde,
On that pleasant morn of the early fall
When Lee marched over the mountain wall,—
Over the mountains winding down,
Horse and foot, into Frederick town.
Forty flags with their silver stars,
Forty flags with their crimson bars,
Flapped in the morning wind: the sun
Of noon looked down, and saw not one.
Up rose old Barbara Frietchie then,
Bowed with her fourscore years and ten;
Bravest of all in Frederick town,
She took up the flag the men hauled down;
In her attic window the staff she set,
To show that one heart was loyal yet.
Up the street came the rebel tread,
Stonewall Jackson riding ahead.
Under his slouched hat left and right
He glanced: the old flag met his sight.
“Halt!”— the dust-brown ranks stood fast.
“Fire!”— out blazed the rifle-blast.
It shivered the window, pane and sash;
It rent the banner with seam and gash.
Quick, as it fell, from the broken staff
Dame Barbara snatched the silken scarf;
She leaned far out on the window-sill,
And shook it forth with a royal will.
“Shoot, if you must, this old gray head,
But spare your country’s flag,” she said.
A shade of sadness, a blush of shame,
Over the face of the leader came;
The nobler nature within him stirred
To life at that woman’s deed and word:
“Who touches a hair of yon gray head
Dies like a dog! March on!” he said.
All day long through Frederick street
Sounded the tread of marching feet:
All day long that free flag tost
Over the heads of the rebel host.
Ever its torn folds rose and fell
On the loyal winds that loved it well;
And through the hill-gaps sunset light
Shone over it with a warm good-night.
Barbara Frietchie’s work is o’er,
And the Rebel rides on his raids no more.
Honor to her! and let a tear
Fall, for her sake, on Stonewall’s bier.
Over Barbara Frietchie’s grave
Flag of Freedom and Union, wave!
Peace and order and beauty draw
Round thy symbol of light and law;
And ever the stars above look down
On thy stars below in Frederick town!"
February,"I’m climbing out of this season, fingernails ragged, belly soft. I tuck a stem of dried mint behind my ear to remind myself.
Once, I bared my shoulders. The bottom of my feet roughed up the dirt with their hard calluses. When I harvested arugula, it smelled of green spice—alchemical veins pulsing sun and dirt and water. I do remember this. I pinned summer light up in my hair and made no apologies for the space I took up—barely clothed and sun-bound.
Now, a ball of twine in the grey sky. The sun rolls low on the horizon. Hangs. Then dips back down again, wind howling us into night.
Inside the erratic rhythm of this wavering flame, I conjure the potent sky of the longest day. Seeds with a whole galaxy inside them. Cicadas vibrating in the alders.
But the sensation of joy slips too quickly into simulacra. Song on repeat. I never meant to find myself in such a cold place, my hair thinning against winter.
Once, red clover grew thick where today’s rabbit tracks pattern the snow. Clover said flow, clover said nourish, clover said we’ve got this.
I reel the memory out, let it linger on the horizon, then reel it back in. I play it out and reel it back in. Some kind of fishing, some kind of flying—again and again. I loosen the buckles of my mind. I take up space in the precision of my breath. I call us all back in."
The Crystal Gazer,"I shall gather myself into myself again,
   I shall take my scattered selves and make them one,
Fusing them into a polished crystal ball
   Where I can see the moon and the flashing sun.
I shall sit like a sibyl, hour after hour intent,
   Watching the future come and the present go,
And the little shifting pictures of people rushing
   In restless self-importance to and fro."
Apparition,"translated by Wilfrid Thorley
The moon grew sad, and weeping seraphim,
Musing among the vaporous flowers aswim,
With slow bows from the sobbing viols drew
White tears that sank in their corónals blue.
It was the blesséd day of your first kiss.
My reverie, eager with new miseries,
Was all a-swoon with perfume of shy grief
That leaves the heart to gather its own sheaf,
And frets not, nor yet sickens of its prize.
I wandered, and the worn way held my eyes
When in the street I saw your sun-girt hair
And you all smiling in the twilit air.
I took you for that elf who, crowned with beams,
Once passed before me in my childish dreams,
And shed white posies of sweet-smelling flow’rs
Star-like for tiny hands in snowy show’rs.
    Apparition 
  La lune s’attristait. Des séraphins en pleurs
Rêvant, l’archet aux doigts, dans le calme des fleurs
Vaporeuses, tiraient de mourantes violes
De blancs sanglots glissant sur l’azur des corolles.
—C’était le jour béni de ton premier baiser.
Ma songerie aimant à me martyriser
S’enivrait savamment du parfum de tristesse
Que même sans regret et sans déboire laisse
La cueillaison d’un Rêve au cœur qui l’a cueilli.
J’errais donc, l’œil rivé sur le pavé vieilli,
Quand avec du soleil aux cheveux, dans la rue
Et dans le soir, tu m’es en riant apparue
Et j’ai cru voir la fée au chapeau de clarté
Qui jadis sur mes beaux sommeils d’enfant gâté
Passait, laissant toujours de ses mains mal fermées
Neiger de blancs bouquets d’étoiles parfumées."

Longing,"If you could sit with me beside the sea to-day,
And whisper with me sweetest dreamings o’er and o’er;
I think I should not find the clouds so dim and gray,
And not so loud the waves complaining at the shore.
If you could sit with me upon the shore to-day,
And hold my hand in yours as in the days of old,
I think I should not mind the chill baptismal spray,
Nor find my hand and heart and all the world so cold.
If you could walk with me upon the strand to-day,
And tell me that my longing love had won your own,
I think all my sad thoughts would then be put away,
And I could give back laughter for the Ocean’s moan!"
Whittier,"Not o'er thy dust let there be spent
The gush of maudlin sentiment;
Such drift as that is not for thee,
Whose life and deeds and songs agree,
Sublime in their simplicity.
Nor shall the sorrowing tear be shed.
O singer sweet, thou art not dead!
In spite of time's malignant chill,
With living fire thy songs shall thrill,
And men shall say, ""He liveth still!""
Great poets never die, for Earth
Doth count their lives of too great worth
To lose them from her treasured store;
So shalt thou live for evermore—
Though far thy form from mortal ken—
Deep in the hearts and minds of men."
Not They Who Soar,"Not they who soar, but they who plod
Their rugged way, unhelped, to God
Are heroes; they who higher fare,
And, flying, fan the upper air,
Miss all the toil that hugs the sod.
'Tis they whose backs have felt the rod,
Whose feet have pressed the path unshod,
May smile upon defeated care,
    Not they who soar.
High up there are no thorns to prod,
Nor boulders lurking 'neath the clod
To turn the keenness of the share,
For flight is ever free and rare;
But heroes they the soil who've trod,
    Not they who soar!"
A Tremor Is Heard in the House of the Dead Man,"A tremor is heard in the house of the dead man 
And a door opens slowly 
Soon after the body is brought to the ground. 
He listens to the talk of the mourners, 
Sipping the words like a bird at a strange water 
Far from home. 
He flutters to him who saw the door opening, 
Calling in a reedy voice to the merciful God 
Who rots the beams and rusts the doors from their hinges. 
The grave lies north. 
He darts through an open window and flies southward
Toward some hovering dots on a white cloud. 
A butterfly comes to the open window, 
Enters—(How strange! 
I’ll drive it away. Do not hurt it.)— 
And blunders back to the garden. 
The voices ebb and resume. 
The clock ticks. 
Father.
    Un temblor se oye en la casa del muerto
  Un temblor se oye en la casa del muerto. 
Y una puerta se abre lentamente 
Poco después de haber dejado el cuerpo en la tierra. 
Escucha la charla de los dolientes, 
Sorbiendo las palabras como un pájaro en un agua rara
Lejos de hogar. 
Aletea hacia el que vio la puerta abrirse, 
Invocando con una voz aflautado al Dios misericordioso
Quien pudre las vigas y oxida las puertas de sus goznes. 
La tumba yace hacia el norte. 
Se lanza por una ventana abierta y vuela hacia el sur. 
Hacia algunos puntos flotando en una nube blanca. 
Una mariposa llega a la ventana abierta, 
Entra—(¡Qué raro! 
La ahuyentaré. Que no le hagas daño.)— 
Y vuelve torpemente al jardín. 
Las voces bajan y se reanudan. 
El reloj hace tictac. 
Padre.

Seeking Always the Word Nearest to Silence,"Seeking always the word nearest to silence—
For speech is a fever, as life an ague of nature—
One nears the undifferentiated nothing, 
The last mask of the multiple delusion. 
Words that have not shape, color or hardness,
Smell or brightness, or the vivid serial ticking
Of clock or heart, attract as if to say: 
Prepare for unbeing, the first and last life. 
Of yesterday’s garden the unsubstantiated green
And dim birdsong are true eternity, 
Though I and this mower accept the tricks of sense,
Hear and hunger, look and thirst, like fools.
    Buscando siempre la palabra más cercana al silencio
Buscando siempre la palabra más cercana al silencio—
Ya que el habla es una fiebre, como la vida es un agüe de 
      la naturaleza— 
Uno se acerca a la indiferenciada nada, 
La última máscara de la desilusión múltiple. 
Palabras que no tienen forma, color o dureza, 
Olor o brillo, o el vívido tictac en serie 
Del reloj o del corazón, que atrae como si dijera: 
Prepárate para el no ser, la primera y última vida. 
Del jardín de ayer el verde infundado 
Y el tenue canto de los pájaros son la verdadera eternidad,
Aunque yo y este cortacésped aceptamos los engaños de 
     los sentidos, 
Oír y tener hambre, mirar y tener sed, como orates.

Tamales on Christmas,"It is tamale Saturday.
The day the colors of the rainbow break
b r e a d.            Today these Brown hands will be coated
In masa and Mama and memory.
A family patterned like
plaid on stripes will go to war with corn
husks and Grandma Lupe's recipe    h a n d w r i t i n g.   
Today I am not artist. Nor social
media handle. I am not
Black Boy Joy. Nor Brown Boy dead. I am
a   b a b y                before its first gulp of tap water. The oldest cousin
still hesitant to clink forks at the adult table.
Today we pick up the place
mats Tia and Big Mama and Papa Sisto left
behind. We’ve never been the same since they    d i e d.       
We grew into something stronger
and weaker at the same time,
most ourselves when colors don’t
m a t c h       but meat is tender, and masa has no clumps,
and air is clean like a mind
that has reconciled with its last meal."
Why I Write Poetry,"After Major Jackson
Because I could say my friends' exes live in a swamp in my heart
            and no one would ask what it means.
Because my head is level and my wrists are narrow.
Because after block parties and cookouts my mom corralled us
            into the bathtub to wash dirt from our soles.
Because nowadays I go to bed with unwashed feet.
Because everyone who didn't eat breakfast in my house hates grapefruit.
Because instead of letting people in, I rebuild myself around them.
Because it haunts me that my aunt would still be alive
            if she still had health insurance.
Because I still think about characters in books I read at age eleven
            now nameless and faceless.
Because all my poems end up in AP style.
Because I always have a crush on someone taller than me.
Because I can't find anyone in New England who knows what it's like
            to ride the Brown Line over the Chicago River in summertime.
Because my best friend and I have different words for love.
Because I'm still afraid to die.
Because I rode Razor scooters on the blacktop with the boys before school.
Because walking through Boston feels like spitting out cold air.
Because I spend a Valentine's Day at a funeral I couldn't cry at.
Because the winter always makes me like this.
Because I don't know what I mean by like this."
The Master-Player,"An old worn harp that had been played
Till all its strings were loose and frayed,
Joy, Hate and Fear, each one essayed,
To play. But each in turn had found
No sweet responsiveness of sound

Then Love the Master-Player came
With heaving breast and eyes aflame;
The Harp he took all undismayed,
Smote on its strings, still strange to song,
And brought forth music sweet and strong."
The Corn-Stalk Fiddle,"When the corn's all cut and the bright stalks shine
    Like the burnished spears of a field of gold;
When the field-mice rich on the nubbins dine,
    And the frost comes white and the wind blows cold;
Then it's heigh-ho! fellows and hi-diddle-diddle,
    For the time is ripe for the corn-stalk fiddle.
And you take a stalk that is straight and long,
    With an expert eye to its worthy points,
And you think of the bubbling strains of song
    That are bound between its pithy joints —
Then you cut out strings, with a bridge in the middle,
    With a corn-stalk bow for a corn-stalk fiddle.
Then the strains that grow as you draw the bow
    O'er the yielding strings with a practised hand!
And the music's flow never loud but low
    Is the concert note of a fairy band.
Oh, your dainty songs are a misty riddle
    To the simple sweets of a corn-stalk fiddle.
When the eve comes on, and our work is done,
    And the sun drops down with a tender glance,
With their hearts all prime for the harmless fun,
    Come the neighbor girls for the evening's dance,
And they wait for the well-known twist and twiddle—
    More time than tune—from the corn-stalk fiddle.
Then brother Jabez takes the bow,
    While Ned stands off with Susan Bland,
Then Henry stops by Milly Snow,
    And John takes Nellie Jones's hand,
While I pair off with Mandy Biddle,
    And scrape, scrape, scrape goes the corn-stalk fiddle.
""Salute your partners,"" comes the call,
    ""All join hands and circle round,""
""Grand train back,"" and ""Balance all,""
    Footsteps lightly spurn the ground.
""Take your lady and balance down the middle""
    To the merry strains of the corn-stalk fiddle.
So the night goes on and the dance is o'er,
    And the merry girls are homeward gone,
But I see it all in my sleep once more,
    And I dream till the very break of dawn
Of an impish dance on a red-hot griddle
    To the screech and scrape of a corn-stalk fiddle."
An Ante-Bellum Sermon,"We is gathahed hyeah, my brothahs,
    In dis howlin’ wildaness,
Fu’ to speak some words of comfo’t
    To each othah in distress.
An’ we chooses fu’ ouah subjic’
    Dis—we’ll ‘splain it by an’ by;
“An’ de Lawd said, ‘Moses, Moses,’
    An’ de man said ‘Hyeah am I.’'”
Now ole Pher’oh, down in Egypt,
    Was de wuss man evah bo’n,
An’ he had de Hebrew chillun
    Down dah wukin’ in his co’n;
‘T well de Lawd got tiahed o’ his foolin’,
    An’ sez he: “I’ll let him know—
Look hyeah, Moses, go tell Pher’oh
    Fu’ to let dem chillun go.”
“An’ ef he refuse to do it,
    I will make him rue de houah,
Fu’ I’ll empty down on Egypt
    All de vials of my powah.”
Yes, he did—an’ Pher’oh’s ahmy
    Was n’t wuth a ha’f a dime;
Fu’ de Lawd will he’p his chillun,
    You kin trust him evah time.
An' yo' enemies may 'sail you
    In de back an' in de front;
But de Lawd is all aroun' you,
    Fu' to ba' de battle's brunt.
Dey kin fo'ge yo' chains an' shackles
    F'om de mountains to de sea;
But de Lawd will sen' some Moses
    Fu' to set his chillun free.
An’ de lan’ shall hyeah his thundah,
    Lak a blas’ f’om Gab’el’s ho’n,
Fu’ de Lawd of hosts is mighty
    When he girds his ahmor on.
But fu’ feah some one mistakes me,
    I will pause right hyeah to say,
Dat I’m still a-preachin’ ancient,
    I ain’t talkin’ ‘bout to-day.
But I tell you, fellah christuns,
    Things’ll happen mighty strange;
Now, de Lawd done dis fu’ Isrul,
    An’ his ways don’t nevah change,
An’ de love he showed to Isrul
    Was n’t all on Isrul spent;
Now don't run an’ tell yo’ mastahs
    Dat I’s preachin’ discontent.
‘Cause I is n’t; I’se a-judgin’
    Bible people by deir ac’s;
I’se a-givin’ you de Scriptuah,
    I’se a-handin’ you de fac’s.
Cose ole Pher’oh b’lieved in slav’ry,
    But de Lawd he let him see,
Dat de people he put bref in,—
    Evah mothah’s son was free.
An’ dahs othahs thinks lak Pher’oh,
    But dey calls de Scriptuah liar,
Fu’ de Bible says “a servant
    Is a-worthy of his hire.”
An’ you cain’t git roun’ nor thoo dat
    An’ you cain’t git ovah it,
Fu’ whatevah place you git in,
    Dis hyeah Bible too ‘ll fit.
So you see de Lawd’s intention,
    Evah sence de worl’ began,
Was dat His almighty freedom
    Should belong to evah man,
But I think it would be bettah,
    Ef I’d pause agin to say,
Dat I’m talkin’ ‘bout ouah freedom
    In a Bibleistic way.

Afternoon in Andalusia,"But why wouldn’t geometry equal divinity
1000 + 1 + 1 + 1         What is faith
but trust in one & infinity         Once

in Granada I studied a wall of polygons
or was it stars or bees         or for a second         a flash
of gladiolas in a field until I could see

a galaxy         planets spinning         spokes on a wheel
clocks or buttons         vines blooming         a tornado
from a future century              garden of ellipses

my lover’s cornea         alight each morning 
God         so far away         & right in front of me"
Inspiration Point,"Pacific Palisades
We’d stare at horses at Will Rogers Park, then hike
the Loop Trail to Inspiration Point, &
I’d lag back 
to be a kid. Alone. & under that aloofness—hid
vengeance. A rusty burr or two 
in my left sneaker. & under that—anxiety. The salt 
dripping through chaparral 
brows, into my brown lashes. &
under that—rage. A perfectly purple 
shell some kid favored & lost.
& under that—hope. The pounded 
ground. & under that—a vast
clearing on the cosmos, also called Inspiration
Point. A gorgeous, inner hilltop
with a curious figure 
taking in the Pacific view. 
Breathing chicory & chamise. Naming 
every wind-boarder near Catalina 
Island. That high-noon, far-sighted figure—seemed
a bit burnt, but warm. A bit divine. 
But—sometimes—I didn’t find that figure 
wow-ing at a thing 
no one had ever seen—at a new bird 
better than a phoenix. (There’s something better than 
a phoenix!) Sometimes, my hand 
stretched towards some nether new
creation & I was the figure 
who named it."
Euler’s Equation,"Let me draw a sonnet at this godless hour,
in one sitting, at the sudden taste of you.
#SelfEvidentTruth: reality forms from the verge
of chance—particles not seen but tongued.
Another you wafts in as soon as the other
you leaves, my random turnstile of thirst.
But suddenly, alone. Just a memory of taste:
Poached eggs, pancakes, tenderness, knowing
that I have eaten not only what I made but what all
of you served in return, quenched only if swallowed.
Taste has always been a second-rate sense,
unlike our sight, unlike Euler’s Equation that
sees light in chaos. All works of nature evolve
from one moment of coincidence. An absence,
a rebellion, the fifteenth line of a sonnet."
Little Matrons,"slumped in the crook of a nook, bereft
of lullabies and apple pie, playing duck duck
goose with my mind to find the smallest child
nested inside another then another until I
ring around the rosie back to myself. This
recess is cold. It’s like everyone vamoosed
to get to America first. Hello, what if we didn’t
want to go? All that’s left is an echo and a
banshee I hardly know. Some people say
hypnosis or past life regression therapy may
help, but I locked this chamber for a reason.
Ate the key. What is the shape of memory
that needs to be forgotten? Yet a voice keeps
calling: Let me out, let me out, let me out, let me"
Recurrence,"We shall have our little day.
Take my hand and travel still
Round and round the little way,
Up and down the little hill.
It is good to love again;
Scan the renovated skies,
Dip and drive the idling pen,
Sweetly tint the paling lies.
Trace the dripping, piercèd heart,
Speak the fair, insistent verse,
Vow to God, and slip apart,
Little better, little worse.
Would we need not know before
How shall end this prettiness;
One of us must love the more,
One of us shall love the less.
Thus it is, and so it goes;
We shall have our day, my dear.
Where, unwilling, dies the rose
Buds the new, another year."
Snow in October,"Today I saw a thing of arresting poignant beauty:
A strong young tree, brave in its Autumn finery
Of scarlet and burnt umber and flame yellow,
Bending beneath a weight of early snow,
Which sheathed the north side of its slender trunk,
And spread a heavy white chilly afghan
Over its crested leaves.
Yet they thrust through, defiant, glowing,
Claiming the right to live another fortnight,
Clamoring that Indian Summer had not come,
Crying “Cheat! Cheat!” because Winter had stretched
Long chill fingers into brown, streaming hair
Of fleeing October.
The film of snow shrouded the proud redness of the tree,
As premature grief grays the strong head
Of a virile, red-haired man."
Song,"My heart to thy heart,
   My hand to thine;
My lips to thy lips,
   Kisses are wine
Brewed for the lover in sunshine and shade;
Let me drink deep, then, my African maid.
Lily to lily,
    Rose unto rose;
My love to thy love
    Tenderly grows.
Rend not the oak and the ivy in twain,
Nor the swart maid from her swarthier swain."
Fulfilment,"I grew a rose once more to please mine eyes.
All things to aid it—dew, sun, wind, fair skies—
Were kindly; and to shield it from despoil,
I fenced it safely in with grateful toil.
No other hand than mine shall pluck this flower, said I,
And I was jealous of the bee that hovered nigh.
It grew for days; I stood hour after hour
To watch the slow unfolding of the flower,
And then I did not leave its side at all,
Lest some mischance my flower should befall.
At last, oh joy! the central petals burst apart.
It blossomed—but, alas! a worm was at its heart!"
Cancer and Nova,"The star exploding in the body; 
The creeping thing, growing in the brain or the bone;
The hectic cannibal, the obscene mouth. 
The mouths along the meridian sought him, 
Soft as moths, many a moon and sun, 
Until one 
In a pale fleeing dream caught him. 
Waking, he did not know himself undone, 
Nor walking, smiling, reading that the news was good,
The star exploding in his blood.
    Cáncer y Nova
  La estrella estallando en el cuerpo; 
Algo rastrero, creciendo en el cerebro o en el hueso; 
El caníbal hético, la boca obscena. 
Las bocas del meridiano lo buscaron, 
Blandas como polillas, muchas lunas y soles, 
Hasta que una 
En un sueño desvaído y fugaz, lo atrapó. 
Despertando, no se reconocía a sí mismo deshecho, 
Ni caminando, sonriendo, o leyendo que las noticias eran buenas,
La estrella estallando en su sangre. 
  Traducido por Layla Benitez-James
   "
Departure,"                    I
This wind sighing recalls certain things.
I warned you:
Beware of it:
Passion has wings;
And will return with the year’s return
Like a bird on migrant wings.
This wind sighing recalls
Certain half-remembered things.
                    II
You have left something of you behind.
But you went with eager step,
Fearful, lest what you have left behind
Should halt your eager step.
When the lean years bring you back,
You will be as one
Who has laughed the lean years with strange men;
You will be different then.
                    III
Beyond the gate of the sun
I shall not seek you:
Before the last days are done
You have sung your last song,
You have played your last tune,
You have danced your steps too soon.
It is not easy
When great moments are so few:
Beyond the gate of the sun
I shall not seek you."
Promise,"I grew a rose within a garden fair,
And, tending it with more than loving care,
I thought how, with the glory of its bloom,
I should the darkness of my life illume;
And, watching, ever smiled to see the lusty bud
Drink freely in the summer sun to tinct its blood.
My rose began to open, and its hue
Was sweet to me as to it sun and dew;
I watched it taking on its ruddy flame
Until the day of perfect blooming came,
Then hasted I with smiles to find it blushing red —
Too late! Some thoughtless child had plucked my rose and fled!"
The Seedling,"As a quiet little seedling
    Lay within its darksome bed,
To itself it fell a-talking,
    And this is what it said:
“I am not so very robust,
    But I’ll do the best I can;”
And the seedling from that moment
    Its work of life began.
So it pushed a little leaflet
    Up into the light of day,
To examine the surroundings
    And show the rest the way.
The leaflet liked the prospect,
    So it called its brother, Stem;
Then two other leaflets heard it,
    And quickly followed them.
To be sure, the haste and hurry
    Made the seedling sweat and pant;
But almost before it knew it
    It found itself a plant.
The sunshine poured upon it,
    And the clouds they gave a shower;
And the little plant kept growing
    Till it found itself a flower.
Little folks, be like the seedling,
    Always do the best you can;
Every child must share life’s labor
    Just as well as every man.
And the sun and showers will help you
    Through the lonesome, struggling hours,
Till you raise to light and beauty
    Virtue’s fair, unfading flowers."
Passion and Love,"A maiden wept and, as a comforter,
Came one who cried, 'I love thee,' and he seized
Her in his arms and kissed her with hot breath,
That dried the tears upon her flaming cheeks.
While evermore his boldly blazing eye
Burned into hers; but she uncomforted
Shrank from his arms and only wept the more.
Then one came and gazed mutely in her face
With wide and wistful eyes; but still aloof
He held himself; as with a reverent fear,
As one who knows some sacred presence nigh.
And as she wept he mingled tear with tear,
That cheered her soul like dew a dusty flower,—
Until she smiled, approached, and touched his hand!"
"It’s Not Really about Them, It’s about Us","Braiding my hair, working with, and not against,
the silver waves, breaking through the crests
of my crushed curls—
I consider my life, my regrets and my absences,
my not-love life at press time, the small bundle
of garbage, tied-up by the door,
and I think, looking into the mirror, As soon
as I don’t need them, that’s when they’ll come
running; it’s a law, it’s diffusion
and I think, I could write a theory of whiteness,
but I won’t, because that’s exactly what they want.
Then I follow that with,
It’s not really about them, it’s about us,
and I consider broadcasting that thought
to the whole wide world—
but instead, I sit down to piecemeal these
lines in the quiet of my quiet-dark,
for you, listening now."
"January 20, 2021","This morning the snow
lowered so slowly, I was able
to lift my son—still in pajamas—
and show him each delicate
tendril of frost, the arctic structure
of a solitary flake. I was able
to make coffee and think only
of making coffee, a sensation
so sudden and dangerous
in its delight, I had to dilute it
by burning the toast. This morning
I breathed deeply, clicked on
the television and watched—
for a moment—a Boeing VC-25 fade
over our capital and dwindle
from sight. Nothing says revenge
like dwindle from sight. Later,
I’ll hear the new president pledge
to be better, try a bit harder.
I will try to believe him
the way a child believes a father
in an overcoat, by the door.
But for now, all is quiet.
My coffee tastes delicious,
and nothing says revenge like
the stillness of snow."
Insurrecto,"for David Fagen
Corporal, U.S. Army (1898-1899); Captain, Philippine Republican Army (1899-1901)
Our worst enemy is General May:
rainy season, the lieutenant means, monsoon
much like Tampa’s summer storms. Roads become marsh;
not just flooding but fever, a fire
that hollows me out. We throw lifelines
to overturned ferries; casualties grow long.
Incessant drizzle. Letters take too long
to reach home. I prefer carousal, cards: dismay
in officers’ faces when I cross the line.
The guardhouse my second home. My fines soon
add up: a month’s pay. Most of it earned, so far,
by killing time, not ladrones: we march
to summits, spy gugus drilling below; march
back down to find the enemy long
gone—only grinning farmers left. Hellfire
spits the lieutenant, scanning ridges, amazed
to have been rolled by shoeless bandits again. Soon
he’ll snap, like the officers in Samar who lined
up boys young as ten—sympathizers, aligned
with insurgents. (So said General Smith.) Marshaled
them, blindfolded, to clearings. Too soon
for them to swell the soil; long
rest for short lives. Their will bewilders me—
faced with Gatlings, Krags, methodical shellfire
they ambush hand to hand. Bolos; sniper fire
in enfilades. Harass our lines
then beat back to boondocks, a maze
of jungle, cordilleras, rice fields, marsh.
Land surely rich with poetry—tulang
in their tongue—land like home: typhoon
cousin to hurricane. When the monsoon
shifts, so do I—I snap, desert for foreign fires.
Rope can kill black soldiers but not disease, lungs
like ours grittier, the C.O.s say; we’re maligned
but nicknamed “Immunes.” My old unit marches,
black against brown. Under white. As if to make
the Far East a second South. I captain a line
for the Filipino side: a turncoat, merging
nations. Our flag has no color. Soon it may."
[Oye! This is an apartment building ode.],"Oye! This is an apartment building ode.
But not just any ode, an ode about breathing,
walking, jumping, running, skipping people.
An ode to a time where we’d remember what
odes felt like to read outside. An ode about
oding so hard it boxes itself into a sonnet.
Harder than bus stop benches and light rail
seats, taxes, and systemic poverty. The oding
of this poem is an apartment building sonnet
about people stacked up like bricks like words
in a sonnet. People that will tap your shoulder
to make sure you’re listening to the fact that this
poem is a token, a favor, a shirt off their back.
Oye! This is The Apartment Building Ode.
  There’s Freestyle, Hip Hop, and Bachata on the steps
depending on the time of day we pick up groceries.
There are bikes by the curb and notebooks on those steps,
soda bottles, 2 quarter juices, and candy wrappers in bags.
There is a 10pm curfew for noise and the music plays
until 9:59, because the stoop DJ wakes up early too.
There are “No loitering on the stairs” signs in every hall-
way though it is understood that what we do isn’t aimless.
There is the smell of food, home-cooked or homemade,
plantains in C5, Hot Pockets in A3 and Chinese in the lobby.
There are lovers, soothsayers, tall-tale tellers, doers, hustlers,
potatoes, flowers, lighters, and so many hand gestures.
 
This is a concrete box that we call home.
There is a life we’ve learned to love and live."
"Suspending Disbelief While Brown, Part II","We use ketchup because they laughed. And then they used our salt. And then our salt flecked gold. And then our gold was put in their museum.
Their books get newer. Our books miss pages.
Their mothers pay our mothers who come home too tired to mother.
***
What the anger is like:
You write, it reifies. It clots. 
Our misery, it prints. 
We commiserate: we pain and seizure. 
They laugh. They spectate. They garland. They trophy. 
***
What the sadness is like:
Tender word after tender word succumbs before it saves you.
***
What the sadness is like:
You are a sculptor and you cannot move your arms. The marble stares the way desire waits."
The Song of the Smoke,"I am the smoke king,
I am black.
      I am swinging in the sky,
      I am ringing worlds on high;
      I am the thought of the throbbing mills,
      I am the soul of the Soul toil kills,
      I am the ripple of trading rills.
Up I’m curling from the sod,
I am whirling home to God.
I am the smoke king,
I am black.
I am the smoke king,
I am black.
      I am wreathing broken hearts,
      I am sheathing devils’ darts;
      Dark inspiration of iron times,
      Wedding the toil of toiling climes,
      Shedding the blood of bloodless crimes,
Down I lower in the blue,
Up I tower toward the true.
I am the smoke king,
I am black.
I am the smoke king,
I am black.
      I am darkening with song,
      I am hearkening to wrong;
      I will be black as blackness can,
      The blacker the mantle the mightier the man,
      My purpl’ing midnights no day dawn may ban.
I am carving God in night,
I am painting Hell in white.
I am the smoke king,
I am black.
I am the smoke king,
I am black.
      I am cursing ruddy morn,
      I am hearsing hearts unborn;
      Souls unto me are as mists in the night,
      I whiten my black men, I blacken my white,
      What’s the hue of a hide to a man in his might!
Hail, then, gritty, grimy hands,
Sweet Christ, pity toiling lands!
Hail to the smoke king
Hail to the black!"
A Reverie,"You may speak of a grave in a distant land,
    Or of one ’neath ocean’s foam,
Where the dolphins play o’er the sunny spray,
    Far from the dear old home;
Where the coral peaks form a glorious tomb,
    And the mighty waters lave,
But there is naught in the wide world sought
    Like the heart’s deep anguished grave.
You may tell of a grave ’neath the burning sands
    Of the tropics fevered zone;
Where silence reigns o’er the desert plains
    So desolate, so forlorn.
Where the lion’s roar is the liveliest sound
    That o’er that waste is heard—
And the forest bird hymns a plaintive lay,
    A requiem for the dead.
Again you may tell of a grave unsought
    Far from the home of youth;
Where the willow weeps as the exile sleeps
    Akin to Mother Earth.
But O! methinks, there’s not a woe
    That can the bosom cleave,
Or as deeply wound, as the lowly mound
    O’er the heart’s deep, anguished grave."
Aubade with Edits,"Both terrible storytellers, both bad
            With a punchline
Too, bad with a tale—short, long
            Or otherwise. Both, a little bit
Of college & plenty of experience—
            My parents. Their hands told
On them, & their cooking enough
            To keep mouths too busy
For small talk but not for lies, gold plated
            Lies. “Yes, still waiting
For Jordans or a Walkman,
            & please, no knock-offs.” “No mom,
Not the fakes.” “No, it’s not the same
            As the others, dad.”
O edits, O tweaks that transcend
            Trouble—you, neither fake
Nor fib even when half-awake in the new
            Light when parents revise stories or future
Visions so a paycheck opens
            Wider than my busy-begging
Mouth. Edits, not lies when dad dies
            Alone, broke to the bone. His version
Better than all the unforeseen costs
            Death accrues. Edits, unheard
Requests or complaints from mom’s eyes.
            Her last-month-tongue entangled,
Unable to spin or spend even a nickel’s
            Worth of lies. O Edits, sun’s up cutting
Sleep & dream with light & heat.
            I do nothing while narratives move
Along the ceiling: I’m ok. I’m ok.
            I’m ok. Soon I will tell the lie
To the mirror, to my shoes & car
            Keys, to my kiss-goodbye love,
To my needling co-workers at lunch
             Time, & the commute home again. 
A kiss hello & a kiss for baby, too
            Until back to dream
When my dead parents visit
            With new things to say."
Self-lit,"You’re humming through the streets,
self-lit. I have to correct strangers
who touch your head without asking,
as if to bless you or to take a blessing from you.
When we leave the city, you become
a boy hunting locusts. Nature stuns you—
you load up your pockets and want to bring it
home with us, but Nature stays with nature, I say,
a refrain learned from another mother.
You cannot be unpuzzled by things,
but you marshal all your sweet bravado for me,
who tries but never beats you in a game of chess.
I witness the rook and Queen
moving inside your thinking, squaring
and hewing to pathways of wins, losses.
Childhood’s end is always menacing,
apparent places of stars mark its outer limits.
It heaves up in you when you lose,
when you rage, when you’re afraid.
Glowering out of a fever dream, your eyes shine
as you confess in the dark I was the monster.
You show me a hornet’s nest on a bed of cotton,
hold it up as an offering. I wonder with you
at what you hold—
            summer rivers that show bracken corners,
            eye agate marbles,
            daggerwings of our days in the city
            built of strangers,
                         in a country built of sky.
When I pull you close,
what will flee trembles in you."
Corinthians 13:11,"I follow Marcia Brady on Twitter: Mo McCormick, Actor/Author.
She posts a video with her older brother and they dance, a fast waltz,
under an oak tree with dozens of hanging pastel paper parasols.
She holds his hands, looks up into his face: he watches her feet.
I wish we were friends. I’d call her, Mo, too, one syllable, low:
prayerful, bovine. Mo asks her brother, do you have a girlfriend yet?
She leads, spins him around: I love her in a way I couldn’t back then.
As a child, I loved the middle girl, Jan, the jealous one, Eve Plumb,
Bible spondee fruit, with a TV J-name, and that blue crochet vest.
When I was a child, I spake as a child, I understood as a child.
When I was a child, I’d see Mo’s face on my tin lunchbox, but now I see
her freckles mirrored a small star cluster visible on clear nights—
Constellation of Bejewelled Silver Studs on Soft Velvet Bell Bottoms.
Constellation of Kindness. Constellation of Purple Devotion."
Having a Fight With You,"is like being burned up
in a twelfth-floor elevator.
Or drowned in a flipped SUV.
It’s like waking with scalpels 
arrayed on my chest.
Like being banished to 1983.
Having a fight with you 
is never, ever less horrid: that whisper 
that says you never loved me—
my heart a stalled engine
out the little square window.
Your eyes a white-capped black sea."
Walnuts in Nangarhar,"That time
in Aagam when father, a child then, picked
fresh walnuts with the mountain girls;
they showed him the fleshy green
skin over shell & nut he rubbed
on his lips & cheeks, giggling.
The girls circled around him, clapped
in unison & teased. In a hand mirror,
he saw himself stained pink,
a delicious trick that kept
its color a full week—
That time
so long ago, in the
season of walnuts."
"Songs to Joannes, VII","My pair of feet
Smack the flag-stones
That are something left over from your walking
The wind stuffs the scum of the white street
Into my lungs and my nostrils
Exhilarated birds
Prolonging flight into the night
Never reaching — — — — — — —"
A Prayer,"O Lord, the hard-won miles
    Have worn my stumbling feet:
Oh, soothe me with thy smiles,
    And make my life complete.
The thorns were thick and keen
    Where’er I trembling trod;
The way was long between
    My wounded feet and God.
Where healing waters flow
    Do thou my footsteps lead.
My heart is aching so;
    Thy gracious balm I need."

Acedia Sestina,"How now to rig the petrified words to reveal 
The infinite in a new permutation of language.
How to green again the fallow bandwidth  
Of talk when fire is funeral & river means hearse.
When a syndrome grows precise in the panic-blue air
Where weaving death’s black wing
A muted swarm descends. An empty swing.
Uproot the new park benches to reveal
Cindered bones, the phantom smell of burnt hair
Watering the mouths of the wretched. Gauge 
His strength as the naked king pulls the black hearse
Of myth through jaundice streets bragging its width.
In the shallow arms of the prison cell, a width
Of man’s breath can keep his body warm. A flap of wing
Means sky, to be executed without a hood. As the hearse-
Pulled fare of the nation’s dead reveal
Froth drying in the mouth of his language,
The king’s men upholster the king’s velvet chair.
Pitched to the injured choir, 
His rabid hosts feed the bandwidth
Of fear that plugs the old faultline, prunes language
To the dull blade of history’s axe swing.
What the news stifles, the river unveils:
The shallow graves of sand, the watery hearse.
On the shore, the stray dogs of my nation rehearse
A new hunger. Heat drags in the air
What a flanked disturbance of crows’ flight reveals:
A bloated corpse, twice its living width,
Strangled in a bush. A ballooned arm like a black wing 
Fastened to what has no face in language.
The dogs were feeding off this language,
This purple delirium washed up in a hearse.
Then the keening vultures begin to descend, their wings
Unpetalling like something extracted them mid-air.
I had to remember this, wake & find the width
Of my body bound to this boat for the tidal reveal
At high noon when the width of each shadow’s wing
Dwarfs. I did not rehearse this, I had no guide to veil
The language for what was killing us out of thin air."
April Moon,"The moon tonight is closer to us
than it will be
for the rest of the year,
grace willing, the year
we will remember as the Great Pandemic.
Pulling us closer into its orbit,
shining the light of its fullness into the room,
we turn to hold in our hands
each other’s face as if
for the first time,
and the last—
Pink Moon, Egg Moon, Moon of New Grass."

A Winter Evening,"translated by Martha Dickinson Bianchi
Sable clouds by tempest driven,
Snowflakes whirling in the gales,
Hark—it sounds like grim wolves howling,
Hark—now like a child it wails!
Creeping through the rustling straw thatch,
Rattling on the mortared walls,
Like some weary wanderer knocking—
On the lowly pane it falls.
Fearsome darkness fills the kitchen,
Drear and lonely our retreat,
Speak a word and break the silence,
Dearest little Mother, sweet!
Has the moaning of the tempest
Closed thine eyelids wearily?
Has the spinning wheel’s soft whirring
Hummed a cradle song to thee?
Sweetheart of my youthful Springtime,
Thou true-souled companion dear—
Let us drink! Away with sadness!
Wine will fill our hearts with cheer.
Sing the song how free and careless
Birds live in a distant land—
Sing the song of maids at morning
Meeting by the brook’s clear strand!
Sable clouds by tempest driven,
Snowflakes whirling in the gales,
Hark—it sounds like grim wolves howling,
Hark—now like a child it wails!
Sweetheart of my youthful Springtime,
Thou true-souled companion dear,
Let us drink! Away with sadness!
Wine will fill our hearts with cheer!
    ЗИМНИЙ ВЕЧЕР 
  Буря мглою небо кроет,
Вихри снежные крутя:
То, как зверь, она завоет,
То заплачет, как дитя,
То по кровле обветшалой
Вдруг соломой зашумит,
То, как путник запоздалый,
К нам в окошко застучит.
Наша ветхая лачужка
И печальна и темна.—
Что же ты, моя старушка,
Приумолкла у окна?
Или бури завываньем
Ты, мой друг, утомлена,
Или дремлешь под жужжаньем
Своего веретена?
Выпьем, добрая подружка
Бедной юности моей,
Выпьем с горя; где же кружка?
Сердцу будет веселей.
Спой мне песню, как синица
Тихо за морем жила;
Спой мне песню, как девица
За водой поутру шла.
Буря мглою небо кроет,
Вихри снежные крутя:
То, как зверь, она завоет,
То заплачет, как дитя.
Выпьем, добрая подружка
Бедной юности моей,
Выпьем с горя; где же кружка?
Сердцу будет веселей."
Man Praying—Encroachment,"Some deaths take                  the slow turn            in the light from dusk to night.
My father takes his               time                            is trying to befriend him.
When he goes                        with it                         he will go.
He will trust death                as a friend                 near the end of his life.
There were not many           late nights                  he did his drinking at home.
And worked one job             for 50 years                 he didn’t gamble or cheat.
Was home for dinner           every night                 he listened to us talk in silence.
Now death walks by             his side                        of the bed sinks, his body
Weighs the mattress            down                           the hall it breaks into a sprint.
I witness it encroach            step by step                he eases into lethargy.
Hair and skin looking so     thin                              was he always so thin?
A creaking sound walks       around the house     I hear the weight of delirium.
He can’t sleep with               the noise                     of him gasping echoes.
When he awakes                   he dreams                  his father yelling, Get Up.
Someone’s at the door         knocking."
The New Year,"The New Year comes—fling wide, fling wide the door
Of Opportunity! the spirit free
To scale the utmost heights of hopes to be,
To rest on peaks ne’er reached by man before!
The boundless infinite let us explore,
To search out undiscovered mystery,
Undreamed of in our poor philosophy!
The bounty of the gods upon us pour!
Nay, in the New Year we shall be as gods:
No longer apish puppets or dull clods
Of clay; but poised, empowered to command,
Upon the Etna of New Worlds we’ll stand—
This scant earth-raiment to the winds will cast—
Full richly robed as supermen at last!"
Farewell,"translated by Jenny Minniti-Shippey
If I die,
Leave the balcony open.
The boy is eating oranges.
(From my balcony I hear him.)
The reaper scythes the wheat.
(From my balcony I feel it.)
If I die,
Leave the balcony open!
    Despedida 
  Si muero,
dejad el balcón abierto.

The spirit of rebellion
also called hopelessness                                                               
has begun another sinister round.    
His dark and cold come straight from hell.
I was expecting happy days from May,
but so far the only sunny thing was Albertina’s news
that she was chosen to sing “Jesus is the bread of heaven.”
That’s bread without butter, Albertina,                                              
just so you know. 
We eat it with bitter herbs.
    Previsão do Tempo 
  O espírito de rebelião
também chamado de tristeza e desânimo
começou de novo sua ronda sinistra.
Sua treva e seu frio são de inferno.
Por causa de maio, esperava dias felizes;
e ensolarado até agora só o recado de Albertina,
escolhida pra cantar Jesus é o pão do céu.
Pão sem manteiga, Albertina,
é bom que o saiba.
É com ervas amargas que o come."
“Why Don’t You Parent a Little?”,"The story is that there is so much loss,
  so much waste in a woman who does not make
  a body with her body. Such sunk potential
  in a sex that does not produce.
  The story is that we have progressed.
  The story is that the black woman is safe.
  The story is that the black woman is safe
  if she protects her king.
  The king is dead."
Velvet Shoes,"Let us walk in the white snow
    In a soundless space;
With footsteps quiet and slow,
    At a tranquil pace,
    Under veils of white lace.
I shall go shod in silk,
    And you in wool,
White as white cow’s milk,
    More beautiful
    Than the breast of a gull.
We shall walk through the still town
    In a windless peace;
We shall step upon white down,
    Upon silver fleece,
    Upon softer than these.
We shall walk in velvet shoes:
    Wherever we go
Silence will fall like dews
    On white silence below.
    We shall walk in the snow."
Mistletoe,"Sitting under the mistletoe
(Pale-green, fairy mistletoe),
One last candle burning low,
All the sleepy dancers gone,
Just one candle burning on,
Shadows lurking everywhere:
Some one came, and kissed me there.
Tired I was; my head would go
Nodding under the mistletoe
(Pale-green, fairy mistletoe),
No footsteps came, no voice, but only,
Just as I sat there, sleepy, lonely,
Stooped in the still and shadowy air
Lips unseen—and kissed me there."
Here in the Time of the Winter Morn,"Here in the time of the Winter morn, Love,
I see the Sunlit leaves of changing hue
Burn clear against a sky of tender blue,
Here in the time of the Winter morn, Love.
Here in the time of the Winter morn, Love,
I hear the low tone bells of changing song
Ring clear upon the air the full day long,
Here in the time of the Winter morn, Love.
I hear the bells, I see the changing leaves,
And one lone heart for Summer silent grieves,
Here in the time of the Winter morn, Love."
Context is all,"This me, not that me, that them, no, the other them, that we, or this
we, all we, both of them, and all of we, when there, not here, but me
then, before then, and before we, when we, how we, when we spoke
then, never spoke back to them, then. Silent we, resilient we, existed,
as an existential us, observing with restraint and bemusement
(terror), a noisy them, childish them, and if we over-spoke, we
spoke using our bodies to them, head tilted or hand back at them, or
facing them with all our backs, never breaking face, so masked to all
senses of them, all tenses of we, over-prepared.
We had better. We had better be better than them. We had better be
better beginning and end, early and fitful. We had better be better
beginning and in the middle, too. Be better between life and death,
better in the visible and sure better than them in the places they
overlooked, than them and their soundtrack. We had better be better
than them who draft and re-draft them-selves, “what destroyed me,
created them,” or so we thought mistaking the well off for well-
being, enough to be them, so some of us thought and thought better
of. We had better be better being draft selves than them even if it
meant drowning in virtuous poison."

Tehura,"On viewing Gauguin's Mana'o Tupapa'u ,The Spirit of the Dead Keep Watch
The chill of violet around you,
Olympia of Oceania, you lie pito down:
a burnished, brown body like mine, draped
over white sheets. And for the moment,
I can't move ⎯ How did we get here?
Your framed face turning toward mine,
I see a pleading in your eyes, on your lips
                                                                      a moan of dread.
            Quickly I struck a match, and I saw Tehura,
            immobile, naked, lying face downward on the bed:
            Feet crossed at the ankle, hands palm down, eyes
            inordinately large with fear.
I draw closer to you, mounted on the wall ⎯
            Never had I seen her so beautiful, so tremulously beautiful
see waves of dark hair tucked
behind your delicate ear, pulled
violently from your face, neck.
Your seduction rendered ⎯
            With a scattering of flowers,
            completely naked, waiting for love. Indecent!
through brush strokes of bronze:
arching your back, lifting your chin to meet
                                                        a ceaseless stare.
            She seemed not to know who I was, and I too
            felt a strange uncertainty, in this half-light ⎯
Behind you, the spirit of the dead,
            a dangerous apparition only she could see
more his than yours, looms in black, stares⎯
            I was afraid to move. Might she not take me for a tupapa'u?
blankly, unbending. In its hand,
the spark of a bud lights the tiares⎯
            Yet, such coppery beauty, gold skin ⎯
on your mattress, each blossom opening
                                                        into a glorious sneer.
            ... and the night was soft, soft and ardent, a night of the tropics...
E Tehura, my pokiʻi,
in your face I see my own,
the same curves and shadow twisting
into a sad silence. I know
this is not who we are, not Why or How⎯
only smoke from flailing ghosts, tricks
of fading light, only the wash of gold paint over
                                                        this rotting wood frame.

Venus de Milo: On Being Rediscovered,"It’s like that moment,
hair mussed,
teeth coated
in the stale air
of the morning after
when rushing
for a taxi,
pantyhose
and shoes
in hand,
you encounter
anyone who
thinks they
know you."
Oh!,"translated by Garth Greenwell and Idra Novey
Voice of the shopping bags
whirled in the wind
like a small quarry
between its claws
to play with.
Voice of the fry shops
early,
before anybody enters,
freshly mopped, fluorescent.
    ¡Oh! 
  Voz de las bolsas de compra
revoloteadas en el viento
como una pequeña presa
entre las garras
con que jugar.
Voz de las freidurías
temprano,
antes de que nadie venga,
recién fregada, fluorescente."
Root Systems,"for Yolanda P. Salvo
I have this assignment to write on origins. 
All I can think about is your rellenong 
talong at sunrise, garlic thick air, 
wisp of your floral dress sways on linoleum 
as you commit to careful chemistry 
of fried egg. 
                      To say I have roots means all us kids, 
                      knee deep in dirt. Means I only know how 
                      to eat because you brought backyard, earth
                      soaked, each bite caressed by sweat of 
                      forehead. The land gives us what we need
                      not like this country— 
We didn’t get it then, you training us for end 
of times, or maybe, bringing us back to our beginning. 
Bold brown knuckles turned into baon, lunch time

                      harsh light, profuse cackle, grew it into momentum 
                      to fuel every star speckled report card on the fridge,

Our last photo together, San Fabian, July 2007—  
96°F heat, palm tree silhouette on cheeks. You said
you liked my haircut, So Pogi! Big smirks. Fingertips 
pressed on lychee skin, our version of prayer. 
Not to mention, the way you taught me to pick 
apart until we found tender. 
                      How we knew somehow together, 
                      there could be sweetness. You asked me to open 
                      every fruit, juice like sprinkler from our old house. 
                      This breaking apart. This delicate pouring. 
                      This bulbous bounty. This bellyful harvest
                      was always ours, no matter the soil we stood on."

Three months ago, the stream did flow,
    The lilies bloomed along the edge;
And we were lingering to and fro,—
Where none will track thee in this snow,
    Along the stream, beside the hedge.
Ah! sweet, be free to come and go;
    For if I do not hear thy foot,
    The frozen river is as mute,—
    The flowers have dried down to the root;
    And why, since these be changed since May,
        Shouldst thou change less than they?
                                                          2.
And slow, slow as the winter snow,
    The tears have drifted to mine eyes;
And my two cheeks, three months ago,
Set blushing at thy praises so,
    Put paleness on for a disguise.
Ah! sweet, be free to praise and go;
    For if my face is turned to pale,
    It was thine oath that first did fail,—
    It was thy love proved false and frail!
    And why, since these be changed, I trow,
        Should I change less than thou?"
Snow,"All day the clouds
   Grow cold and fall,
And soft the white fleece shrouds
   Field, hill and wall;
And now I know
   Why comes the snow:
The bare black places lie
   Too near the sky."

          thru a hole in one of they necks.
a hole i put there. 
          //
it smelled of vanilla* near the young men
bent & giggling golds over their dice & bills.
          *someone’s girl lingering
            or a cold twist up
            or or one of them frenched
            & pearled a left that will kill them
            but makes it sweet
held in my lungs until they were gone
did you know we are made of cake?

            must live near oil—argan & jojoba
                     may trash lift from the street like damp birds
but for now, bless the bottle eight times smashed
if it was once auntie’s cold pop fetched. 
who should bless it? 
        is the most popular god on the block
        the one making the miracles? 
        who sends the breeze
to Kenya’s neck? 
                             who was the tribe of ants
                                         escorting Dayshawn home again alive
who kept someone’s son from seeing your son & seeing
his mother’s rent the kicks you overtimed for him?
                            & since i implied the mother 
                            let her be God here.
         God has a good foot, a bad foot & a new ’09 ford. 
                   God hasn’t
worked in three years. 
                   God hasn’t been fucked right since he went
                             back in. 
God, your bonnet 
is a crown worm-woven & my morning star.
         God hasn’t believed in God since the wake."
Vespers,"after a promise by Staceyann Chin
Because I don’t
             have to anymore, 
I pray for you
             who never had to 
be—& wonder 
             what god might
damn that girl 
             to labor through
another man’s 
             command to 
create anything
             but herself. 
Who’s to say   
             what might
have arrived
             instead of me?
Holy is what
             happens when
there’s nothing    
             between your belief
& what you do.
             Holy is the savior
I was taught
             would come
eventually, but
             looking back
was you. Blessed 
             be that parking lot—
its early, empty
             peace—& blessed 
be the ring of keys
             who made her 
rounds & kept 
             you feeling safe.
Blessed be
             the woman I
would meet
             & not have to
become; praises 
             for this sleeping
child we chose
               & what new mercies
time divulged: nurse
             at your shoulder, 
doctor at your 
             feet: then’s only, 
holy trinity
             that made this 
life complete."
We Are All God’s Poems,"all I crave is light & yet
                                winter
sky is busy imitating milk
frozen in an upturned bowl
to be a person is a sounding
through,
            host of breath
rehoused & rib scribbled inside
you there above
                   the page
casting your gaze over us
wanting us to be your mouth
& what would you say
                     with my body
bowed to bear the weight
of a line so taut it sings"
何日/What Day,"                                    On this seventh day

                                    to meet his Queen, time tracked 
                                                  by the close-knit wheeling             
                                                  of stars. I watch. You come
                                    to me tonight, drunk on wine 
                                    and cards, nails ridged black
                                                  with opium
                                                  to ease the pain
                                    of work. We are
                                    all men here. Any
                                                  body can be
                                                  a bridge, little raven,
                                    your eyes squeezed shut
                                    but not from pain.
                                                  We are 
                                                  a trestle, a grade
                                    we build together. 
                                    What matter if you say
                                                  you’d never choose
                                                  me were there
                                    women willing
                                    in this desert. I
                                                  chose. I choose 
                                                  the memory we share 
                                    of rivers, your hair
                                    of smoke and raw,
                                                  wet leather. A man
                                                  in another 
                                    man’s hand makes himself
                                    tool or weapon, says
                                                  the overseer, as if a man’s use
                                                  to another is only one
                                    of work. Pleasure
                                    is our only chosen
                                                  future. You
                                                  are the home 
                                    I briefly make, the country
                                    I can return to. Now
                                                  the moon wheels
                                                  its white shoulder
                                    in the dark as you push me
                                    to earth, slip 
                                                  my whiskered tip
                                                  of hair into your mouth."
What Is Not,"My twisted alibi, the silent who
and almighty why

or misplaced where. Or what
as in what went wrong

and when. What is not
turned sideways or backwards?

A lifeless rut, a knot,
in my most likely never

and all for naught,
not knowing if I aced the test.

Notwithstanding,
it kneels to reason

if not is the godless spot
of who I am. I forgot."
Minna (IX),"Sedate and archaic, a twilight-frilled haze
Walks over the meadows like rolled-out centuries
Quivering in sprightly welcome.
Trees pushed down by silence;
Trees lolling in comely abandon;
Trees pungently flamboyant,
Their leaves spinning in the wind’s golden elusiveness.
Trees probing the shrilly sensitive sunset
Like little, laced nightmares leaning
Upon a scarlet breast;
Trees sprinkling their stifled mockery
Upon the blue tomb of the air;
Trees, are you silenced beings
Whitening into the winding paradise
Of old loves seeking a second death?
And has this archaic, twilight-frilled haze
Moulded me to your semblance?"
Ka ‘Ōlelo,"O ke alelo ka hoe uli o ka ‘ōlelo a ka waha.
The tongue is the steering paddle of the words uttered by the mouth.
                                                      – ‘Ōlelo No‘eau
‘ekahi
Think of all the lost words, still unspoken,
waiting to be given use, again, claimed,
or for newly born words to unburden
them of their meanings. There are winds and rains
who have lost their names, descending the slopes
of every mountain, each lush valley’s mouth,
and the songs of birds and mo‘o, that cope
with our years of slow unknowing, somehow.
It was not long ago that ‘ōlelo
was silenced, along with its dying race,
who lived, then thrived, reverting to the old
knowing words. English could never replace
the land's unfolding song, nor the ocean’s
ancient oli, giving us use again.
‘elua
Like the sea urchin leaves, pimpling its shell
as its many spines let go, turn to sand,
my great-grandfather’s Hawaiian words fell
silent, while his children grew, their skin tanned
and too thin to withstand the teacher’s stick,
reprimands demanding English only.
The law lasted until 1986,
after three generations of family
swallowed our ʻōlelo like pōhaku,
learned to live with the cold, dark fruit under
our tongues. This is our legacy—words strewn
among wana spines in the long record
the sand has kept within its grains, closer
to reclaiming our shells, now grown thicker.
‘ekolu
Ka ‘ōlelo has a lilting rhythm
arising from the coastal mountains’ moans
as they loosen their salted earth, succumb
to the ocean and its hunger for stone.
It carries the cadence of nā waihī,
born from the fresh rain in nā waipuna
and flowing past the fruiting ‘ulu trees,
wiliwili, kukui, and koa.
It holds the song my grandfather longs for
most, as he remembers his father’s voice,
and regrets not asking him to speak more
Hawaiian, so that he may have the choice
to offer words in his inheritance,
knowing his ‘ohā will not be silenced.
‘ehā
Think of all the old words that have succumbed,
their kaona thrown oceanward for English
words we use like nets to catch the full sum
of our being, finding too little fish
caught in the mesh, even as we adjust
the gauge, reshaping them to suit our mouths.
I must admit I love the brittle crust
my only tongue’s foreignness forms; it crowns
the dark, churning pith of prenatal earth
rising in the volcano's throat, unspoken
for now, founding my wide island of words.
And kaona, a ho‘okele’s current,
circles during my wa‘a’s slow turn inward,
steering my tongue through each old word learned.
‘elima
As the ‘ape shoot, whose delicate shoots
shoot forth their young sprouts, and spread, and bring forth
in their birth, many branches find their roots
in the dark, wet ‘ōlelo the earth bore.
My unripe tongue taps my palate, my teeth,
like a blind ko‘e that must feel its way
through the liquids, mutes and aspirates of speech,
the threading of breath and blood into lei:
“E aloha. ‘O wai kou inoa?”
I ask, after the language CD’s voice.
“‘O Kekauoha ko‘u inoa,”
my grandfather answers, “Pehea ‘oe?”
So, we slowly begin, with what ‘ōlelo
we know; E ho‘oulu ana kakou."
Star-Spangled Banner,"A betrayal
to stand
with your hand
over your heart
and sing
the song
of the country
occupying
your country
to read every star
on the flag
above
your country’s flag
and see the last one
there: small, white
and pointed
stitched into the blue
with a thin thread
as if
it has always
been that way
as if
it can never
be undone."
This Island on Which I Love You,"And when, on this island on which
I love you, there is only so much land
to drive on, a few hours to encircle
in entirety, and the best of our lands
are touristed, the beaches foam-laced
with rainbowing suntan oil,
the mountains tattooed with asphalt,
pocked by telescoped domes,
hotels and luxury condos blighting
the line between ocean and sky,
I find you between the lines
of such hard edges, sitting on
the kamyo stool, a bowl of coconut,
freshly grated, at your feet.
That I hear the covert jackaling
of helicopters and jets overhead
all night through our open jalousies,
that my throat burns from the scorch
of the grenaded graves of my ancestors,
the vog that smears the Koʻolaus into a blur
of greens, that I wake to hear the grind
of you blending vegetables and fruit,
machine whirl-crunching coffee beans,
your shoulder blades channelling ocean,
a steady flux of current.
Past the guarded military testing grounds,
amphibious assault vehicles emerging
from the waves, beyond the tangles
of tarp cities lining the roads, past
the thick memory of molasses coating
the most intimate coral crevices,
by the box jellyfish congregating under
ʻOle Pau and Kāloa moons, at the park
beneath the emptied trees, I come
to find you shaking five-dollar coconuts
(because this is all we have on this island),
listening to the water to guess
its sweetness and youth.
On this island on which I love you,
something of you is in the rain rippling
through the wind that make the pipes
of Waikīkī burst open. Long brown
fingers of sewage stretch out
from the canal, and pesticided
tendrils flow from every ridge
out to sea, and so we stay inside
to bicker over how a plumeria tree
moves in the wind, let our daughters
ink lines like coarse rootlets
in our notebooks, crayon lines
into ladders on our walls
and sheets. Their first sentences
are sung, moonlit blowhole plumes
of sound that calls pebbles to couple,
caverns to be carved, ʻuala to roll
down the hillside again, and I could
choke on this gratitude for you all.
This island is alive with love,
its storms, the cough of alchemy
expelling every parasitic thing,
teaching me to love you with
the intricacies of island knowing,
to depend on the archipelagic
spelling of you lying next to me,
our blue-screen flares their own
floating islands after our daughter
has finally fallen asleep,
to trust in the shape and curve
of your hand reaching out to hold mine
making and remaking an island our own."
Paradox,"I know you love me better, cold—
Strange as the pyramids of old,
Responselessly;
But I am frail, am spent and weak
With surging torrents that bespeak
A living fire!
So, like a veil, my poor disguise
Is draped to save me from your eyes’
Deep challenges.
Fain would I fling this robe aside
And from you, in your bosom hide
Eternally!
Alas!
You love me better cold,
Like frozen pyramids of old,
Unyieldingly!"
Trap Music,"            Wet Charles dropped by the homeboys
in his busted high-top burgundy Chucks, hand 
            out for a buck, or two, from us young bucks, 
also rocking Chucks, trying to cop a couple ends
for a few gallons of gas or diapers for his newborn
daughter. Wet Charles could spin into splits. Quick
to say
             he never begged, traded, or borrowed
anything he couldn’t first steal. The highest point
in many homes is the attic. The jester’s hat
            jingles. The dope fiend’s pipe rings.
Is it the fire or the smoke that makes a comedian?
Even when I mad-dogged Charles, telling him
            to kick rocks with them ashy-as-hell Chucks 
            I never actually looked into the stones
of his eyes. I had known him since childhood, 
we all had, before he began chasing a rock 
                                     up and down a hill.
Stoned every day. Think of addiction as never being
able to find your phone. We were not embarrassed
by Charles but by what we might one day become.
The way bigger sand tiger shark embryos
            feed on smaller embryos in the womb,
we served classmates we had joked with in gym.
Slanging dope smokes up your sense of humor.
We never understood why the police chuckled
“circumstances” as the reason for harassing us
when we stood in a circle smoking on the block.
            Charles didn’t dozen about dope, just surged
            in his circuit, looking for ways to get high.
            Biking from the trolley to the Four Corners 
of Death, the intersection of Euclid and Imperial:
Greene Cat Liquor, Réal taco shop, the gas station,
                                    what was Huffman’s BBQ,
            where the only constant were entrepreneurial
            young men setting up corners in front of constantly
changing businesses with hastily painted front windows,
            where the persistence of the C
            in “Chicken Shack”
            could still be seen on the glass door
            of the new no contract cell phone store.
Archetypes have a way of worming into beauty.
The flaw is the small writing of a hero.
            Through what crack did Orpheus
                        sneak a minute fire from hell?
The sweet chemical scent of someone smoking rock
in a broken light bulb is a plasticity I can’t forget.
I didn’t pay any mind to the moralism of Nancy Reagan’s 
eggs or D.A.R.E. commercials in the eighties.
As we went most of those dampened days lighting 
something, or other, listening to the mercurial philosophies  
                               of Ice Cube, Wu-Tang, Spice-1,
            or Sugar Free. We smoked water, or what a hip
                         toxicologist might nasally call angel dust.
            You can be full of agua and not well.
If you’re not careful, time will find you a fiend.
I’m told
that rappers name themselves
            now with Lil or Young followed
            by randomly chosen abstractions: Lil e.g.
                                                           Young i.e.
                         Back in the stone age of hip-hop,
                         in the early nineties,
late eighties, so the stories go, rappers
            went into the kitchen and whatever
                         they had milk and honey
            of, voila, they had their stage name.
I was just another empty, scattered wrapper
on a sidewalk in the city.
            That’s how I became Slim Jim.
Though, that was more about stealing
cars than beef. 
We would spend summer evenings at the wooden
roller coaster in Pacific Beach, never going
on the ride but circling the beautiful
boardwalk that was only slightly less majestic
                     than the older homie’s
            primer-painted Glasshouse
convertible with three tall
white walls and one ever altering spare.
Everything was so gorgeous in the back 
seat of that Impala.
The moon was so brilliant in the sky.  
                         It was quite the shiner.
I’d watch the women around my way 
rub petroleum jelly on their forehead,
then their cheekbones, before a fight. 
Taking off your golden earrings
             does not make hearing
the truth any easier, but that water 
made the bass and elasticated cadence
of “Pocket Full of Stones” even more
resonant as we waded the highways home
from the rollercoaster with a trunk full of
18” box speakers rattling our bodies:
six sixteen-year-olds in the cramped 
back seat of a Datsun Wagon trying 
to release our own trapped music."
Fr**dom,"ignites in me plenitude
that scents rain. Sense
the sky is full of surprising
music. Timpani, trumpet
a blue tent torn that orders
cogent, cumulative event in which no false intonation
claims itself king
over all. Every last woman
man, and child proof the rain falls
never to be worn out
Freedom is the breaking point beyond rage
I’m not scared and I don’t care where the dream
undertakers have warned me not
to take too much, not to
love too much, not to look too closely at the past,
What could there be left to break?
Nothing left to be broken
Nothing left to be taken."
Mourning Birds,"Here a thousand birds dispute
The gun going off
the random back fire
who handled who
and who rose to be recognized
and how the body came to be fresh
fallen there
and why the girl was tacked
and how her wrists looked slight in hand cuffs
and the exact nature of the orange pin
and the load glassing her eyes
the load incalculable and
the incalculable load.
Here a thousand birds dispute
the fresh blood on the sidewalk
the battle line, how it was drawn
how the sides were chosen
had there been a trial
Or any doubt and if so
how it was framed
did the shot hang in the air and who
was there to hear it, and here
Hold this thought—4 are shot per day
As xenon follows its element
Or night its day time shadow
As penumbra fades into solids
and endures a rain of blows
—there falls a reign of blows
Here a thousand birds dispute
What went wrong
the stopped clock
the orange pin
the random call
the fall from childhood
the fall, the incalculable fall,
the fall incalculable
this time to not let the familiar
obsequies masking obscenity
twist lips, the birds dispute
these too, the televised worship of cinders is riveting
junk heartache abetted by hollow gestures
The birds’ disputations grow louder
frantic against glass
stunned splintered and hushed,
in shadowy, honeyed innocence
The gun going off
The random back fire…..
appears as random as asking
who’s got the gun
who owns the gun
who sold the gun
who pulls the gun
and who does the gun let sleep."
Meditation in the Open-Air Garage,"Leaves have no choice
but to articulate the wind:
aspens like zills, aglint and atilt;
the willow, a lone zither.
Riffling the cottonwoods at dusk,
winds find me cushioned against
the concrete in the open-air garage,
facing the trees, the drive, the road,
the mountains up the canyon’s
other side, until an onrush bellows
a mindless heartless ecstasy
through the empty sack of me."
from “The Trees Witness Everything”,"The Wild Geese
They are not wisdom
or freedom or history.
They are not what’s lost.
They are nothing but wild geese.
I can hear them everywhere,
wings pushing down metaphor.
  Late Spring
Does spring start grieving
in April or May? Once each
spring, the girl appears
in the white house behind mine.
The window opens.
The girl paces, phone to ear.
One day I look up,
the girl is gone, window closed,
and I go back to dying.
  Utterance
Have you ever stood
on a highway in pitch-black
and heard nothing but singing?
  The First Year
The year after death
is full of stretching, where things
pull so hard your bones
break, because they were never
bones, were always solitude.
  Threshold
The crows have lifted
away all the question marks.
They aren’t interested
in finding truth, since they have
already seen our insides."
Memorial Hoops,"The day broke a record for cold, for us wanting
To be anywhere but outside, & it was late
May, the weekend we called Memorial. My mother
Is a veteran, but that is a story for another time,
& we were driving into the mother of rivers state,
My youngest son, named after two men, one who
Turned a trumpet into a prayer, the other who
Before a piano became whatever those who know say
G-d sounds like, me, & friends, who like me, imagined
Watching their sons trade baskets with strangers
Was some kind of holy. Around us was more granite
Than Black folks & I carried Primo Levi’s If This Is a Man
In my knapsack, hesitant to return to all the astonishing
Ways we make each other suffer &, still, somehow,
Survive, & astonished most by how we remember. I’ve
Forgotten my fair share of things that matter. But
Who am I kidding? The weekend was about
Basketball. We’d driven three hours to this colder
Weather. My youngest boy hoped he’d heat up once
A ball touched his hands. Did I say we named the child
After the idiosyncrasies of Jazz, all because as children
I don’t think my wife & I knew enough ambition
To save us from what we’d encounter. These were the days
When he and the nine he suited up with desired
Little more than to hear the rasp of a ball against whatever
Passed for wood in a gym with a hoop. There is something
To be said about how basketball makes men of boys and boys
Of men. The ref who chattered with us parents wondered
Why a cousin the age of the ballers ate chips for breakfast.
The other team had a player who made me think, though
She be but little she is fierce, as she, the only girl on
The court slipped a jewel into that hovering crown
We cheered, even those of us whose boys sought to dribble
& jump shot their way to the glory of a win. & when Miles
Came down as if he knew what would happen. I didn’t hold
My breath. A crossover, the ball then swung around his back,
The kid before him lost on some raft in a wild river. Maybe
He knew the ball would fall true because he turned around
To watch us as much as to get back on defense. We laughed
& laughed & watched as kids barely large enough to launch
all of that need at a target did so, again & again."
Proof,"Proof that we live in a broken world and a broken world is unlivable.
Proof that the carrot turns into the stick and vice versa. Proof that that seems normal, self-sufficient.
Proof that we sometimes destroy things that are broken and can’t be
fixed and sometimes fix things because to live with them broken is
unthinkable.
Proof that we switch roles, sometimes to destroy things that are
broken and can’t be fixed and sometimes to live with things that are
broken because to fix them would be unthinkable
Proof that we learn to live with the unthinkable.
Rectangles in tangerine, orange and persimmon fall into place, take
our names, simulate full hands. Proof that having full hands leaves
no time for questions.
Proof that we can’t help grabbing the sharp end, even when all the
warnings are there.
Proof that we find the hot water, the hot water finds us.
Proof in the tongue of ruin and burn. Fluent in the language of minus.

Winter with the Gulf Stream,"The boughs, the boughs are bare enough,
But earth has not yet felt the snow.
Frost-fringed our ivies are, and rough
With spiked rime the brambles show,
The hoarse leaves crawl on hissing ground,
What time the sighing wind is low.
But if the rain-blasts be unbound,
And from dank feathers wring the drops,
The clogg’d brook runs with choking sound,
Kneading the mounded mire that stops
His channel under clammy coats
Of foliage fallen in the copse.
A single passage of weak notes
Is all the winter bird dare try.
The moon, half-orb’d, ere sunset floats
So glassy-white about the sky,
So like a berg of hyaline,
Pencill’d with blue so daintily—
I never saw her so divine.
But thro’ black branches—rarely drest
In streaming scarfs that smoothly shine,
Shot o’er with lights—the emblazon’d west,
Where yonder crimson fire-ball sets,
Trails forth a purfled-silken vest.
Long beds I see of violets
In beryl lakes which they reef o’er:
A Pactolean river frets
Against its tawny-golden shore:
All ways the molten colours run:
Till, sinking ever more and more
Into an azure mist, the sun
Drops down engulf’d, his journey done."

In the Event Of,"Officer how you know I’m dancing is the body
-cam. Look, I’m riding centuries of whips, the first half
 
Of the ghost, arms out the window up, the second half
Arms flat on the pavement, palms down, now the ghost is whole
 
My arms stretched forward, like I’m bowing, but if I
Were standing, stretched above my head. Officer how
 
You know I’m dead is that I seem to bow to you"

Still ahead somehow.

Big Clock,"When the big clock at the train station stopped,
the leaves kept falling,
the trains kept running,
my mother’s hair kept growing longer and blacker,
and my father’s body kept filling up with time.

I can’t see the year on the station’s calendar.
We slept under the stopped hands of the clock
until morning, when a man entered carrying a ladder.
He climbed up to the clock’s face and opened it with a key.
No one but he knew what he saw.

Below him, the mortal faces went on passing
toward all compass points.
People went on crossing borders,
buying tickets in one time zone and setting foot in another.
Crossing thresholds: sleep to waking and back,
waiting room to moving train and back,
war zone to safe zone and back.

Crossing between gain and loss:
learning new words for the world and the things in it.
Forgetting old words for the heart and the things in it.
And collecting words in a different language
for those three primary colors:
staying, leaving, and returning.

And only the man at the top of the ladder
understood what he saw behind the face
which was neither smiling nor frowning.

And my father’s body went on filling up with death
until it reached the highest etched mark
of his eyes and spilled into mine.
And my mother’s hair goes on
never reaching the earth."
Fog,"between my ribs, fog above the cemetery
where my grandmother
and great-grandmother pass
paper airplanes through the walls, above
the defunct train station and the abandoned zoo
where my friend and his lover
fucked in a tiger cage. Fog in my aorta,
in the hearts of squirrels
who lug around acorns too wide for their throats.
Fog in my cheese sandwich. Fog in my underwear
drawer, in my love’s mouth,
inside the watermelon’s
darkest seed. All of us a dream
the La Brea Tar Pits
are having. Fog above the tar
and fog inside the bones
below the tar. My mother mistaking her child
for a spool of fog. My love
catching the fog
as it leaves the champagne bottle.
Fog casting shadows
in three dimensions, but not the ones
that matter.
Let the fog’s calls
go to voicemail. Tell the fog
to eat shit, burn the fog’s letters.
Watch the fog recede
from the sky’s hairline. My body
where the fog was."
When your son abandons the lawnmower for the second time in as many days,"We all want to leave this widening night,
            this barking at the thing we can’t see.
No one walks through their story un-stung.
            This yard, this life, like a book of changes,
the moment buzzing by like a prophecy,
            your body a constellation of pain.
We spend our time stumbling through the white fog,
            searching the doctrine of our own breath
when all we need do is crawl deep inside 
            the silence that comes after and face
the teeming hole in the ground, the wasp’s nest, 
            that cousin of the eyelessness of space.  
Do not fear the ache and swell my sweet boy.
            It’s easy to hate what we’re given."

A Desert Memory,"Lonely, open, vast and free,
The dark’ning desert lies;
The wind sweeps o’er it fiercely,
And the yellow sand flies.
The tortuous trail is hidden,
Ere the sand-storm has passed
With all its wild, mad shriekings,
Borne shrilly on its blast.
Are they fiends or are they demons
That wail weirdly as they go,
Those hoarse and dismal cadences,
From out their depths of woe?
Will they linger and enfold
The lone trav’ler in their spell,
Weave ‘round him incantations,
Brewed and bro’t forth from their hell?
Bewilder him and turn him
From the rugged, hidden trail,
Make him wander far and falter,
And tremblingly quail
At the desert and the loneliness
So fearful and so grim,
That to his fervid fancy,
Wraps in darkness only him?
The wind has spent its fierce wild wail,
    The dark storm-pall has shifted,
Forth on his sight the stars gleam pale
    In the purpling haze uplifted.
And down the steep trail, as he lists,
    He hears soft music stealing;
It trembling falls through filmy mists,
    From rock-walls faint echoes pealing.
Whence comes this mystic night-song
With its rhythm wild and free,
With is pleading and entreaty
Pouring forth upon the sea
Of darkness, vast and silent,
Like a tiny ray of hope
That oft-times comes to comfort
When in sorrow’s depths we grope?
’Tis the An-gu, the Kat-ci-na,
’Tis the Hopi’s song of prayer,
That in darkness wards off danger,
When ’tis breathed in the air;
Over desert, butte, and mesa,
It is borne out on the night,
Dispelling fear and danger,
Driving evil swift a-flight."

We don’t even remember
what we look like anymore.

Down here, everything is wrapped
in cloth and tied with yarn.

            The light
            inching through the swell—
            our backs glossy
            as a tooth dipped in honey.
                          
Sometimes I want to climb down a tree in secret.
I want to stand in front of a crowd
and whisper a speech in secret.

                         If they can kiss you,
                         they can kill you.
                            You’re a star, honey,
everyone wants your picture.
                         
             We’ve done this before.
We’ve played every couple in every movie
rubbing makeup on our faces that smears underwater.
                        You keep stuffing my plastic face
             in your plastic mouth
             thinking this will all make it better.

It might.

                                                             What if we rose
                                                above the water
                                                where the moon wraps
                                                             its legs around a man

                            he’s just playing dead.
                                          And then you’ll believe it yourself
                                          and will light a candle for me.
                            Nothing will convince you that prayer is a removal of self—
                                                    a distancing.

            Let’s continue this drowning
to remember what we look like.

                                          Let’s keep waking underwater
                                          until one of us gets it right.

Go ahead, sharpen yourself against these rocks.

Pulling the Moon,"I’ve never made love to a man.

                         I imagine pulling the moon out of his brow.

Pulling the moon out of his brow and eating it again.

                         Eating and pulling his hair in silence.
A kind of silence when the moon goes out.

When the moon goes back and forth between us.

A kind of silence lit for only a moment.
Seeing for a moment through the eyes of the horse.

                         Through the eyes of the dead horse
                         that burns slower than my hair.

My hair that burns the moon off.
My hair with a hand inside it."
Field Guide Ending in a Deportation,"I confess to you my inadequacies. I want to tell you things I do not know about myself. I’ve made promises to people whom I will never see again. I’ve broken down in an airport bathroom stall in El Paso, TX when immigration denied my father’s application. It felt like a mathematical equation—everything on one side needed to equal everything on the other. It almost made sense to be that sad. I am not compelled to complicate this metaphor. I’m selling this for two dollars. Years ago, on my birthday, I came out to my friends. I thought about the possibility of painting their portraits. What a stupid idea. I’ve started to cover up certain words with Barbie stickers in my journal. It occurs to me, sitting in my car, at a Dollar General parking lot, in search of cheap balloons for a party which I do not care about, that I am allowed my own joy. I pick the brightest balloons, pay, drive home and dress for the party. I mouth the words happy birthday to you in a dark room lit by everyone’s phone cameras. Afterwards, I enter all of my emails from five years into a cloud engine and the most used word is ok. I confess that I have had a good life. I spend many nights obsessing over the placement of my furniture. I give you my boredom. I give you my obligation. I give you the night I danced and danced and danced at a child’s birthday party, drunk and by myself. I’ve been someone else’s shame. It’s true, at it’s core, amá was deported because she was hit by a car. For years to come, this will be the ending of a sad joke she likes to tell. I laugh each time she tells the joke to strangers. Something about how there is more metal than bone in her arm. Something about a magnet. She says I thought I had died and death meant repeating a name forever. She says el jardin encierra la boca de mis pasos. But this is a bad translation. It’s more like I felt like a star, I felt like somebody famous."
Russet,"I want to drink

Maybe next
The night—first,

our feet, our feet
the floor. The blue beyond
             the window
returns like a mother
after work, collapsing into
             the living room.
I’m home. I’m done being
in love with
            what leaves—
autumn gathers
in the trees, russet,
             then tries
not to fall asleep
on the cold ground,
            God, it is
hard being happy
if you try—
           instead, be like
this slow
yellow. Let go."
Dog Star,"Take today. I want there

unknown. Return
            to sender—
this, my quarrel
with what
            must be
told. No,
I insist, No.
Yet the wind won’t
            go away 
so easily, the stars remain
& do not grey—
            the boy looking
up into them thinks
he’s seeing them first
            tonight—it’s true,
here the sky & moon
do meet
            in an overgrown field—
nothing here 
tall enough to pretend
            to reach—even him
amazed at the blue,
even you."
Halter,"Nothing can make, make me want
to stay
in this world—
not the grass
with its head of hair
turning grey—
not the swayback horse
in the field
I swear I almost saw
start to saunter—
nor the bent shadows
late in the day
drawing close—
the neighbor’s boat
not yet docked
gathering snow
not the dream
with the moose hunched
in its crown
shedding velvet
led by a silver halter
through the shaded campground—
a shawl over its shoulders
like a caftan on a grandmother
or her rocker
whenever she’s no longer there.
Not the brass nail-heads
on the Adirondack chair
I put together, sweating,
this morning, that creaks
but still
does hold—
nor the cries of the others
above water, beloved
bright voices of summer
echoing like the ice cream man
in his whirring truck—
along the curb his lights flash
like an ambulance
playing the tune
you cannot name—yet know—
except this babbling, like a light
barely shining,
from below the baby’s cracked door."
Quotidian,"No right is more precious in a free country
than that of having a voice in the election
of those who make the laws under which,
as good citizens, we must live. Other rights,
even the most basic, are illusory if the right
to vote is undermined.
—Justice Hugo Black, 1964
Sometimes she wrote about the weather—
how hot it was, or yet another lightning storm
gone as quick as it came. In the catalog
of her days: a dress she was sewing, car trouble,
pay day, laced with declarations of love
to the man who would become my father—
her body bright with desire, a threshold
I would soon cross into being. Two years
before Loving will make their love
legal, my mother writes about marrying
despite an unjust law; and because it is 1965,
Mississippi in turmoil, she writes about a cross
burned at the church next door, interracial
outings at the beach, and being followed
by police—all of it side by side in her letters’
tidy script. Reading them, I can’t help thinking
how ordinary it seems, injustice—mundane
as a trip to the store for bread. And I know
this is about what has always existed,
side by side, in this country. That summer,
my grandmother brought The Movement
home. It tells the story in pictures, and it is
beautiful, my mother wrote, adding, I think
you know the way I am using the word.
On the cover: a black protestor, caught
in a cop’s chokehold, his mouth open to shout
or gasp for air. Inside, pictures I could not bear
to look at as a child: a man tied to a scaffold,
his body burned blacker, the fire still smoldering
beneath him; two boys hanged from a tree
above the smiling white faces of the revelers
turned back toward the camera: a young couple
holding hands, ordinary as any night out
on a date. Now I think of my mother, in love
and writing love letters, cataloguing her days,
those terrible/beautiful pictures on the table
next to the crocheted lace doily and crystal bowl
my grandmother kept for candy: butterscotch
in cellophane wrappers, bright and shiny as gold.
It is July 20th 1965, two months before my parents
will break the law to be married, and my mother,
who’s just turned twenty-one, signs off—her rights
basic as any other citizen’s—Have to run, she wrote;
Got to get downtown to register to vote."
Beeches,"The forest is its own thanksgiving
Walking a mile or so from the road
Past the lake & ancient post office
I skim the long bodies of the beech trees
The elegant ascension of their slender trunks
A kind of gorgeous illusory play
Of white bars against the dark ochre matting
Of the earth below
Peace is where you find it
As here the last secret of the dawn air mixes
With a nostalgia so perfumed by misery
Only the rhythm of the walk itself
Carries me beyond the past
To say I miss you is to say almost nothing
To say the forest is the sanctuary of ghosts
Is only the first step of my own giving way—
Not the giving up—just the old giving thanks"
The Park,"It was I think a small town in Ohio
I taped to the wall above my office desk the postcard
Of Klimt’s painting called The Park
An example of cliché so profuse it touched my heart
Consoling me each time I turned my glance to its
Storm of tiny moth-sized leaves shimmering over all but the bottom
Ribbon of the canvas where the rows of the trunks individuate
The mass of the pulsing foliage above
A figure in a kimono or a robe so lush it too seems foliate
Stands apart from two other figures similarly dressed
But (the two) huddled closely together & moving off the sheer
Right edge of the canvas
& the solitary figure remains oddly hesitant & indistinct
& pensive although
Perhaps she is simply realizing that she does not wish to go
Where all of the others wish to go"
Without,"The world will keep trudging through time without us
When we lift from the story contest to fly home
We will be as falling stars to those watching from the edge
Of grief and heartbreak
Maybe then we will see the design of the two-minded creature 
And know why half the world fights righteously for greedy masters 
And the other half is nailing it all back together
Through the smoke of cooking fires, lovers’ trysts, and endless 
Human industry—
Maybe then, beloved rascal
We will find each other again in the timeless weave of breathing
We will sit under the trees in the shadow of earth sorrows 
Watch hyenas drink rain, and laugh."
What the Silence Said,"Do you still believe in borders now?  
Birds soar over your maps and walls, and always have.     
You might have watched how the smoke from your own fires  
travelled on wind you couldn’t see    
                                            wafting over the valley
and up and over the hills and over the next valley and the next hill.
  Did you not hear the animals howl and sing?   
Or hear the silence of the animals no longer singing?   
Now you know what it is to be afraid.  
You think this is a dream?  It is not
a dream.    You think this is a theoretical question?  
What do you love more than what you imagine is your singular life?   
The water grows clearer.  The swans settle and float there.    
  Are you willing to take your place in the forest again?    to become loam and bark
to be a leaf falling. from a great height.  to be the worm who eats the leaf
and the bird who eats the worm?    Look at the sky: are you
willing to be the sky again?  
                                                You think this lesson is 
too hard for you    You want the time-out to end.  You want
to go to the movies as before, to sit and eat with your friends.
It can end now, but not in the way you imagine    You know
the mind that has been talking to you for so long—the mind that
can explain everything?    Don’t listen.
  You were once a citizen of a country called I Don’t Know.
Remember the burning boat that brought you there?   Climb in."
Wetback,"After the first boy called me a wetback,
I opened his mouth and fed him a spoonful of honey.
            I like the way you say “honey,” he said.
I made him a necklace out of the bees that have died in my yard.
                        How good it must have felt before the small village
                        echoed its grief in his throat, before the sirens began ringing.
How fallow their scripture.
Perhaps we were on stage which meant it was a show,
which meant our only definition of a flower was also a flower.
I waved to the crowd
like they taught me,
like a mini-miss something.
                                       Thank you.
                                       Thank you.
Yes, I could have ripped open his throat.
I could have blown him a kiss from the curtain.
           I wanted to dance by myself in a dark room
           filled with the wingless bodies of bees—
           to make of this our own Old Testament
with all the same beheaded kings
           pointing at all the same beheaded prophets.
           The same Christ running through every door
           like a man who forgot his child in the car.
But the lights were too bright.
I couldn’t hear him because I wasn’t on stage.
                         I could have been anyone’s idea of pity.
How quiet our prophets.
           Let my bare back remind him of every river he’s swam in.
Miel and miel.
           I pulled the bees off the string
           and cupped them in my palm.
I told him my Spanish name.
There was nothing dry on my body—
The lamps falling over in the dark of me."
Cenzontle,"Because the bird flew before
            there was a word
            for flight
                                     years from now
                                     there will be a name
                        for what you and I are doing.
            I licked the mango of the sun—
            between its bone and its name
            between its color and its weight,
                        the night was heavier
                        than the light it hushed.
Pockets of unsteady light.
                        The bone—
                        the seed
            inside the bone—
                                      the echo
                        and its echo
                        and its shape.
            Can you wash me without my body
            coming apart in your hands?
                        Call it wound—
                        call it beginning—
The bird’s beak twisted
            into a small circle of awe.
              You called it cutting apart,
                        I called it song."
In the Fields,"with lines from D. A. Powell
We unyoke owl pellets from marrow 
in desert meadow. His mouth pigeon eye
a torch, womb turned flower. He, still a boy, 
dug from cactus skull. Undress into bark
beetles. He unlearns how to hold a fist 
with my hand. Bursts into dandelion 
seeds. We are all beautiful at least once. 
Mud water puddles along enamel. 
Eyeteeth blossom into osprey. Our bones
dampen like snow melt under squirrel grass. 
We could be boys together finally
as milk vetch, tumbleweed, and sticker bush. 
We can be beautiful again beneath
the sumac, yarrow, and bitter water."

coming to the desert for the first time

just say the name mountain
of mountains—make more
out of bird formations or drainage pipes
deserts build water
so drink the lightning

velvet ants and paper wasps testify
sandstone bones are left long under sage
bones sculpted by sand—sand that collects its legs
in the atmospheric heat to storm and swallow
an entire city—a city that too builds its water
from fly ash—drink from that now
the cactus wren finished the lightning

there are those who come to the desert
because they have always been here
wind coyotes grow thorns
in the inches of light sunsets have
of mountains—do not make a mountain
reach for one and let it turn away from you"
Let There Be Coal,"I.
A father hands a sledgehammer to two boys outside Window Rock.

If I Should Come Upon Your House Lonely in the West Texas Desert,"I will swing my lasso of headlights
across your front porch,
let it drop like a rope of knotted light
at your feet.
While I put the car in park,
you will tie and tighten the loop
of light around your waist —
and I will be there with the other end
wrapped three times
around my hips horned with loneliness.
Reel me in across the glow-throbbing sea
of greenthread, bluestem prickly poppy,
the white inflorescence of yucca bells,
up the dust-lit stairs into your arms.
If you say to me, This is not your new house
but I am your new home,
I will enter the door of your throat,
hang my last lariat in the hallway,
build my altar of best books on your bedside table,
turn the lamp on and off, on and off, on and off.
I will lie down in you.
Eat my meals at the red table of your heart.
Each steaming bowl will be, Just right.
I will eat it all up,
break all your chairs to pieces.
If I try running off into the deep-purpling scrub brush,
you will remind me,
There is nowhere to go if you are already here,
and pat your hand on your lap lighted
by the topazion lux of the moon through the window,
say, Here, Love, sit here — when I do,
I will say, And here I still am.
Until then, Where are you? What is your address?
I am hurting. I am riding the night
on a full tank of gas and my headlights
are reaching out for something."

You helped me see how much I was worth.

Sometimes There Is A Day,"Sometimes there is a day you just want
to get far away from.
Feel it shrink inside you like an island,
as if you were on a boat.
I always wish to be on a boat.
Then, maybe, no more fighting
about land.  I want that day to feel
as if it never happened, when Ahmad was burned,
when people were killed, when my cousin was shot.
The day someone went to jail
is not a day that shines.   I want to have a clear mind
again, as a baby who stares at the light
wisping through the window and thinks,
That’s mine."
And That Mysterious Word Holy,"You might as well take a rotten lemon,
squeeze it in your hand.
Let the juice trickle down your wrist and arm,
sharp bite of acidity prickling your
scratches and scars and say,
I bow down to you.
When the almond tree erupts into
blossom without help from any people—
I bow down. Here we are in the land
of sacred story, chant, shrines,
altars and grottoes, parables,
and soldiers in camouflage are carrying guns.
What does that say about holy?
How much power it doesn’t have—
Thou shalt not kill crumpled under our feet.
Whose religion would you follow?
And why do they wear camouflage?
We can still see them.
Who are they hiding from?
The guns are bigger than we are.
The tanks are bigger than shrines.
Tear gas canisters, grenade casings
littering graves of our ancestors in the cemetery.
I bow down. You bow to the big shining platter
everyone eats off together. Sit in a circle
for your holy rice. Speak after me.
Holy eggplant, my best angel."
Moon Over Gaza,"I am lonely
for my friends.
They liked me,
trusted my coming.
I think they looked up at me
more than other people do.
I who have been staring down so long
see no reason for the sorrows humans make.
I dislike the scuffle and dust of bombs blasting
very much. It blocks my view.
A landscape of sorrow and grieving
feels different afterwards. 
Different sheen from a simple desert,
children who say my name
like a prayer.  
Sometimes I am bigger than
a golden plate,
a giant coin
and everyone gasps. 
Maybe it is wrong
that I am so calm."
On an Island (New York City),"In the last hour of night, I lean into
a book that multiplies its pages.
A settling and a continuum:
bedding down of a sedentary body
and a story of an expanding universe.
For nearly three months I’ve not walked 
out into the evening, my skin un-kissed 
by summering breeze, wafts of ghost 
fragrances of wisteria and gardenia.
                                          A virus has leapt 
into another species, and a plague roams 
the globe, locking down its best predator.
Health: spatial matter and loneliness.
                            I’m not reading the book, 
thumbing its leafing, fanning pages. 
In bed I prefer to be hostile 
and, rather, host my own 
breathing. In the distance, sirens
like a continuous Nina Simone dirge.
                           As water through granite, 
I let myself dream of an archipelago 
where I began, a scattering both
of isolation and attachment."
My father washes his hands.,"Lava soap of grease-cutting, 
Industrial, heavenly clean. 
Lather up work, the rituals. 
Off grime and dirt. Off day’s

Water down the drain’s flower,
Metallic mouth wherein flows
My father’s love’s absolution."
Childhood Elegy,"If our angels hover above us,

revive in the cool of twilight.
The angels will know we have been here for hours.
They will land and rest their feathers around us
and whisper soothing names of winged things: finch, monarch,
whippoorwill, ptarmigan, Daedalus, Icarus, Gabriel...
The angels will bend down and touch their faces
onto ours and borrow our eyes: Earlier,
a horse slipped, breaking its leg.  
A boy stood beside his younger brother. 
Their father came into the stable, carrying a gun.
Quails flitted out of a bamboo tree; the boy 
traced the trail that had led him here,
the field tilled by the dead horse,
where his brother laid down,
dust on his cheeks."
Imagined Love Poem to my Mother from my Father,"My mermaid, I watched you scaling milkfish.
Your hands and arms were silver, 
and your body flecked 
with otherworldly raindrops. 
You were a silver mine to be mined.
Perched on a high branch of your mother's 
mango tree, I saw only a glimmer 
of the blade as you scaled the fish, up- 
and-down strokes, repeatedly, 
gracefully, like an artist whose gift courses 
through her veins.  A strand of your hair 
danced across your forehead, sweat 
trickled down the joyous strained lines 
of your neck, and your breasts, like twin
bells, I heard their transcendental 
sounds.  The glistening, naked 
milkfish escaped the warm Pacific 
for such honor.  Kismet, chosen by Neptune,
it entangled itself on the fisherman's 
net and beckoned you with its fresh, 
clear eyes.  You sliced 
its stomach, sweet blade twisting
in me, scooped out its innards, 
the heart, pulled out the gills
from underneath its head's protective plates.
I almost fell off the tree, there was a deep 
aching in my chest, and my breathing 
was shallow.  Crouched beside the spigot, 
you pumped for water with brisk motions
of your brown arms, cleaning the fish, cradled 
by the softest hands, blood 
and scales streaming onto the earth.
Didn't you hear the fish mouthing my words
as you were salting it: Do unto me, the spy
up on the thick fruit tree, as you have done 
unto the milkfish?  One day I hope 
to recite for you these verses
and in my voice you will hear, 
from across the oceans surrounding
the archipelago, as if reverberated through
the ages, the voice of our future son."
The Daughter,"1
I witnessed nothing
to speak of because
we were Free.
My life at four was the same
as at three. Then whispers wound
into my ears, or,
Father never whispered–
he gave me fire to breathe–
all the oxygen lit the room,
burning me up until my breath
writhed in the body’s drum.
Nothing changed but my mind.
  2
I have a sense of him having said–
to Mother? a Soldier?–
something, but recall
none of the words,
only a sentence ending,
susurrous, in a hiss.
I froze. Put together
the words were menacing, sneak-
attacks, after which fear
riddled me day and night
like bullets. I have never not lived
with the fact of having heard,
  3
the tear in me trauma
rent when I secreted
zero at the bone.
Father was high up–I never got
his echelon straight before the war
was over–but he was someone
who knew things
done to whom by whom
and when I snuck to the door
to listen the sound words
made was lightning flashed
right into my skull."
"instead, it is dark","             (1944/2018)
I woke to the dead
and was among them.
how this happened,
who did this to us
unaccountably
hatred glosses
and evidence belies.
ourselves but ourselves.
I’d gone to the corner
when the bakery opened,
mouthing regards
to a rare sun, then suddenly–
though not–I remember
nothing else.
I feel around me now
and everyone’s near
who waited for bread
or God one morning.
it’s true I thought at the last
I heard something but didn’t think
to turn, nor catch sight of,
nor glean time to."
The Unwritten Volume,"Elle’s writing her book of wisdom.
She writes until she cannot hold her pen.
The labyrinth miraculously is uncovered.
An American woman’s progressing on her knees.
She read something but not Elle’s book.
No one will read Elle’s book.
I walk the circular path, first the left side,
then the right, casting petals to the north,
east, south, and west (this intuitively).
A diminutive prelate shoos me away.
When he leaves, I return to the center.
The organist, practicing, strikes up Phantom.
Elle says she cannot hear him.
Elle! I cry, I cannot see you.
I had prayed Death spare you.
Remember our meal among the termites
of Arcadia Street, that cottage of spirits
with its riddled beams and long veranda
bordered by plantain trees, and the spiral
you traced for me on scrap-paper?
I kept it for such a long time.
The organist, of course, is playing Bach.
A boy has scattered the petals I threw.
Elle’s voice surrounds me.
                                         To quiet hills I lift mine eyes."

"Seagull, Tiny","The villagers are
watchful
in their booths at
boston market
The boys living on
sulfur
and talking about
feelings
and memory The
united states
is the collective
process of
demanding feelings
and a certain
memory I would live
on synthetics
but i hate fragility
Lonely and afraid,
my women sing, there
is no father
in me They talk about
anything
a limit allows There
is hope
of forgiveness, but
my american
corpse has been such
a disappointment
I would live on
feeling safe
and spilling secrets
It is confusing
the plain people
passing
like potato blossoms
When i first
met a trans person at
age 7
she served us mashed
potatoes
at boston market
Mother winced
and statistically it's
unlikely she
kept the job
I am worthy
of eating food i tell
myself There
is some hope of
forgiveness
for boys I would live
on their plastic
It is confusing that
words trick us"
A Note on Form,"Never having lived
among things, but beside
forms of things, I no longer
look where the city lifts a little
further, past houses, oceans,
light from a crane, breathing,
no longer looking the child
hurried beside a mother moving
too, too fast at what escapes
the grasp of leaves & awnings
of leaves, past what is lifted
up, whatever word lifted from
whatever throat it’s lodged—
there being only one throat
between us—past perception,
(anything but arrangement)
& nevertheless perceiving,
as we must, what moves between
us, quickening, no longer a roof,
but atmosphere, precursor
& remnant of speech, remaining,
as it must, perhaps, the least
effective of our music"
A Poem,"It is not normal, a woman says
Never has been, another said
Ordinary, the men women make
In parks, corners of street, rhyme Daily,
I shut the window I pass messages by
The so-called tender seed of birch blows quietly by
It will be crushed in the office of living
and still may take root So crush
what is given The tender too carry guns
Do not forgive the too forgiven"
Fancies,"If we could return from our last long rest
And seek out the ones we loved the best,
Though not in a form to cause them fear,
Just gently to let them feel us near,
Would we come in the scent of the evening flowers
Bringing to mind past happy hours?
Would we come in the song of the mourning dove
Recalling to them our endless love?
Would we come in the sound of the falling rain
Telling them gladly “We shall meet again”?
Would we come in the silently falling snow
With memories of rosy cheeks long ago?
Would we come in the rainbow or sunset’s hue
Repeating to them “Be true, be true”?
Would we speak in some sad sweet song’s refrain
Bidding them wait in gladness, not pain?
These are but fancies, faint and dim;
For dare we question the wisdom of Him
Who gave us through death the victory sweet
To be with our loved ones in joy complete?"
Rhythm of Rain,"                                I
Out of the barrenness of earth,
And the meager rain—
Mile upon mile of exultant
Fields of grain.
Out of the dimness of morning—
Sudden and stark,
A hot sun dispelling
The hushed dark.
Out of the bleakness of living,
Out of the unforgivable wrongs,
Out of the thin, dun soil of my soul—
These songs.
                                  II
Only the rhythm of the rain
Can ease my sorrow, end my pain.
He was a wilful lad,
Laughter the burden he had;
Songs unsung haunted his mouth,
Velvet as soft airs from the languid south;
He was sprung from the dawn,
Flame-crested. He is gone!
Only the lashing, silver whips
Of the rain can still my lips…"
Poem that Wanted to Be a Brueghel,"Snowy road with red 
soil ruts where a wagon struggled. 
Bare trees in middle distance
man with stick and pack
trudging uphill, off balance.
Is he running? And then I’m
back at the podium, all the suits
in the room looking at me like 
where did you go?
Something was cold and afraid. 
Someone went looking. 
It must’ve been amazing
for the great painters when it drifted
into their eyes—the moment
they could freeze the action
before the terrible realization 
that would echo through generations.
Field work in a dry summer.
Blue sky and blaze yellow.
Sweat on the brow of my father
just a boy now, seventeen, lean
and earnest, tight with exertion
pounding fence posts 
with a man I never met, his father. 
Dad swings the sledge down
just as the blank man, glancing back
toward the distant barn, places his hand 
gently on top of the post
to say that’s enough. That’s good, son.
And the hammer is a breezy blur
stopped magically in air 
to never disfigure, sever 
flesh or family tree but still I 
dab paint over my father’s eyes
so he won’t have to see."
(De)colonial Therapy,"The cat releases his urine on
your side of the bed
where it neatly
pools in the indention
you nightly rest your head
How am I to infer this male urine?
A stream of (un)consciousness?
Relief(-lease) to my neuroses?
A psychoanalytical sweet caress?
The cat releases his yearning
on my side of the bed
Westernized tentacles of Thought
Colon(-ized) instinctual urges
s(M)other the Matriarch’s head
My dynamic unconscious reaches
to strangle the cat, my past life
extends a hand to stroke fixations,

Tawkwaymenahnah,"I walk around the small tribal
welfare cabin Kookum
had lived in, searching
for her grinding stones.
On hot August days
we would sit for hours grinding
chokecherries, pits and all.
She would hum or sing
softly in Cree, put the mash
into small patties on cookie sheets,
cover them with screens
to keep the birds out,
set them on the cabin’s low roof
to dry in the hot North Dakota sun.
In the dead of winter, she would soak
the dried patties overnight,
then fry them in bacon grease,
add flour and sugar,
the small shack filling with a tangy
sweet scent, and summer
flooded my every pore.
I take my grandkids berry picking,
they complain of heat, mosquitoes, ticks,
twigs catching their braids.
I wear my apron, make a pouch
to pick the low hanging berries
with one hand and toss them in
like Kookum did.
Kneeling before the flat rock,
braids tied back,
smaller rock clasped in hand,
I pound the fresh berries
pits and all.
Grandkids want to try,
and soon the rock is singing
my grandmother’s songs."

The Door-to-Door Saleswoman,"Look, I’m knocking on your door,
satchel full of flyers for the best subscription
I can offer you—deals for a scholarship
